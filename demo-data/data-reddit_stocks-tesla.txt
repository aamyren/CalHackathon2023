Tesla's cars score the highest of any brand in the EuroNCAP tests nowadays, which are the official European safety tests. If a court calls those cars unsafe, every brand in the world would have to refund their cars.

The company must refund the full purchase price to the plaintiff.June 15, 2023 - 5:11 pm Now shareThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects". Source: APTesla Model SThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects".Berlin, Düsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is "serious defects in driving comfort and safety", including unwanted braking.As far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term "Autopilot".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:09:04'] I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. Now, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.Other brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.Other brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.Other brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.The last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.Tesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:37:30'] Explains why Elon Musk is in Europe right now, even though the "positive" pushing news is saying he is out there promoting Tesla and gaining new investors lol. When in fact he's out there personally trying to put out fires due to Tesla FSD and auto pilot being so darn awful official government agencies have to go after him and sit him down like a child who knew full well what he was doing was wrong in the first place, and sit him down and scold him and ground him and give Elon Musk a consequence for his negative behavior. Like a child! lol.The number of times Tesla and Elon Musk have been involved in covering up or reducing the seriousness of the issues and problems regarding the public safety and driver safety with his cars on the road probably should be taken into account at some point once enough accidents/deaths have occurred to make the information seem more prevalent, like what is the difference between a transparent company and Tesla?A transparent company has no secrets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 04:53:23'] My 2c:ESG was always about a new way for funds to market themselves, ultimately with the goal of growing their AUM.In reality, funds are a 'solved' space. ESG ETFs are majorly identical to regular ETFs, but it makes regular investors 'feel good' which is way to collect funds, and institutional investors are able to boast about their investments.Am I just making this up?Well compare ESGU, the ESG etf with 14bn AUM to IVV, the SP500 etf, and look at their historical performance - identical.Look at their holdings - almost exactly the same.The only major stocks they exclude are WMT, PM, BA, LMT, ADI - and all the others are a tiny % of the SP500.Imagine being able to drop a couple of major stocks from what is essentially the SP500 (well 300, they drop the smallest ones) and collecting 14bn - they get to charge a higher expense ratio too.14bn * 0.15% = 21 million per yearFairly profitable when IVV only charges 0.03% expense ratio, and at $330bn AUM, it collects 99 million per year.(Also 0.15% expense ratio might not seem much, but it's $1,500 on 1 mil per year. The way I see it while someone with 1mil in stocks can afford $1.5k per year, $1.5k still matters for someone with $1mil net worth, and it's 10% of the current 1.5% SP500 dividend yield)

ESG ratings are basically garbage in garbage out.They want every company to be able to make changes to get into ESG funds, even though in the minds of people buying the funds entire industries should be excluded from them due to the obvious harm they cause society and the environment (like tobacco, fossil fuel companies, etc.).Plus to the average person ESG should be measured with qualitative things that you can't just easily turn into a number to quantify. But measuring things qualitatively is really difficult, especially since it opens you up to a lot of differing opinions and biases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 08:42:12'] Not saying ESG brings investors anything but a false reality but read the article. Even if Elon doesn’t believe in it, he still has to realize his company scores lower regarding the Social & Governance aspects of the rating. “Tobacco company Altria, for example, has burnished its ESG credentials after going to great lengths to improve the diversity of its board and winning plaudits for its commitment to LGBTQ Equality. Compare this with Tesla, which fired its LGBT diversity officer last year and whose board is mostly made of white men.”
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 09:05:46'] Lithium mining isn’t exactly environmentally friendly either. Anti-union isn’t exactly worker friendly.Sure, tobacco is generally frowned upon because of the health impacts, but remember that those impacts are largely isolated to just people making that personal choice to smoke.Lots of reasons for Tesla to have poor ratings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 08:00:30'] My daughter bought a Tesla, so proud of her! As a conservative Christian I'm economically, politically and religiously opposed to ESG.I believe in Conservation, not filling landfills with toxic batteries and solar cells, we have to advance our recycling. Our grid can't support a nation of EV vehicles. Hybrid is a better option for domestic transportation at this stage of transition.I believe in equality, not equity that promises outcome without effort or ability. I believe God created men and women. I see trangenderism, spike proteins that target reproduction, the neutering of children, and abortion as the evil means to WEF goals of depopulation.Since buying Twitter and informing on the left establishment, election tampering, manipulation through shadow banning conservative voices,  Elon Musk has been on the left's hit list. And he used to be their darling. I also know China's TenCent is a major investor and influence in Reddit's culture. I anticipate downvoting from my "tolerant" leftist friends, and won't be surprised if my opinion never sees the light of day through moderated censorship.The bottom line is that a duty to investors never mixes well with politics. Just as you may find my views offensive, bigoted and narrow-minded, I find the alternatives equally repugnant.Justification? Ask A-B Inbev, Gillette, and Target about the cost of mixing woke culture and politics with business.

(TSLA was doing well on the 1-year chart compared to most of tech, until Elon said 'buy the dip' and dumped billions the next day, back around $300, and kept dumping billions more directly and through his foundation from Sept-Dec, leading to some shareholder bankruptcies and suicides).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 07:08:54'] I think it’s demonstrably ironic that there’s a comparison between his specific company & the *entire* tobacco industry that happens to be vilified for the mainly the cigarette portion of the industry. It would be more apt to compare all EV business to the entire tobacco industry or maybe to compare Tesla to some cigar manufacturer like AJ Fernandez or Davidoff. All I know is I want a cigar later today & it’s going to be more economically feasible than buying any Tesla vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 08:00:54'] That's heavily framing given that Philip Morris anounced to stop selling cigarrettes and started a campaign and program to help addicted to quit smoking. Ofcourse with this goals, Marlboro makes up for a better company then tesla, but this statement also absolutely ignores the fact that Philip Morris seem to accept their own fate as a dead industry as sealed.It's easy to say a tobacco company is more social, healthy and ecologically friendly if the company stops doing their core business and help people getting independent of the company - lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 10:20:39'] Once you start to get limited assurance over sustainability and ESG reports form companies, it may be an investment metric, but as of now it’s all self reported and no one is legitimately verifying what’s going on.Also, it’s not just about diverse boards / management. There is a ton more that goes into this.Finally, cross sector comparisons don’t make sense for these metrics since a company who’s business is to produce carbon emissions (oil/gas) and a company producing medicine will have drastically different supply chains and tier 2/3 emissions and _shouldn’t_ be compared. (Basically, y’all aren’t reading it right anyway.)

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 16:54:52'] One of the reasons I only buy Tesla is because they do not have anything to do with promoting transgenderism. The lower the ESG, the better for me. They’re also anti union and WFH which is another big factor. Great company leadership. Happy investing 👍🏼

Until he bought Twitter, we were all in on Tesla and was considering another one in the near future. I'm sure that this is not a unique position.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:27:37'] This post is atrocious. It completely fumbles the context. These aren’t the most respectable brands. It’s a survey of 100 random brands ranked.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:06:10'] Ford moved up in reputation????  The auto industry, as a whole, is about to be a giant dumpster fire...The greedy dealerships (Ford being one of the worst offenders) were selling cars way over MSRP, and banks were offering loans way over a rational loan to value ratio.  If you paid over MSRP on a new car in the last 2 years, there's a really good chance you could buy a new model for less than what you owe right now....in some cases (like the bronco, mustang, f150 and lightning) where dealers were charging 25k-50k OVER msrp, you're probably toting a 60-70kk loan on a car that is worth 30-40k. Massive waves of repo's are coming even if there isn't a recession.  If we see a big wave of layoffs, its going to get bad...there is going to be a flood of used cars on the market at a discount.  Banks are going to liquidate for 50 cents on the dollar on a loan they're already upside down on.   Banks are already pulling out of the car business or tightening restrictions.  Every loan option that disappears takes out a level of potential new car buyers.

Most of the time the scoring system makes little to no sense and or has no explanation behind why some are higher than others. A number of surveys in the past have ranked Tesla the highest in brand loyalty, claiming over 90% of buyers would buy again and recommend them to family.

Patagonia dude moved all his money around not for philanthropic reason, but to keep more in the family and to hide where the donation were going.  Saw an article about that when he restructured is business.  Maybe an unpopular opinion or the elephant folks don't like to talk about but ever since Elon drew that little bar graph of where he was on the liberal and conservative side of life several years ago he world has looked at his TOTALLY different and the spillover to Tesla as well.

Zero sheetmetal changes, near zero equipment changes year to year, even the colors and wheel options haven't changed. Early adopters have long since moved on from Tesla onto shinier, newer, cooler EVs. Car geeks never took much to Tesla, so the natural evangelizers (folk who tell their non-car geek friends what's what) haven't been a factor. It feels like a lot of people getting into the cars now are doing it for good lease rates, etc. So yea.... this report surprises me little.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi Reddit!\n\nI\'ve (30M) been stressed about my father\'s retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock.

He\'s convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn\'t really reacted to the bearish arguments I\'ve laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as "robo-taxis" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors i'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:41:33'] When the options are all bad, people tend to choose the extreme gamble.As you have mentioned: "your father is behind on his retirement plan". From his perspective, the option looks like: 1. Gamble with Tesla and you may 4x/10x and have enough for retirement2. Or he can continue with lesser risky investment ~10%  per annum however it *will still be not enough* for his retirementInstead of trying to explain about option 1 downside, which I believe he should know it is risky but still think it is better than option 2, you should try to think and propose option 3.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:42:18'] OP, you’re very right to be worried, but before making a strong push of your suggestion to him, also consider this.If your father takes your advice and Tesla fumbles from now on, then disaster is averted thanks to your help.But what if it doesn’t? Can you handle the blame, guilt, and potential discord with your father that will likely follow?You should consider that risk as well before committing to the push.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 07:50:16'] It is a massive gamble to have 100% of your life savings in a single stock. It could all go to zero. If he doesn’t believe that, show him examples of any number of single companies who were former giants who went under, or whose stock significantly depreciated and has never recovered.A diversified portfolio of stock and bond funds is what every advisor with a pulse recommends for a reason.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 16:49:06'] Obviously the standard answer is index funds, with some bonds at his age, and keeping everything in one stock is crazy. But here are some other things to think about.- If he's behind on his retirement funding, then that's probably not going to work out for him. Various measures of market valuation still say the overall market is valued pretty highly, and companies like Vanguard are projecting low returns over the next decade. Depending on how far behind he is, that might not be viable.- Volatile stocks are horrible for people prone to buying high and selling low, but apparently your dad has the cojones to hold on for the long term. TSLA still has to do well but at least he'll reap the benefits if it does.- TSLA's prospects don't entirely depend on self-driving. Watch the recent Investors Day presentation, most of it was about radically reducing costs while increasing quality and scale. Also check out Sandy Munro's videos, he's an engineer who consults with automobile manufacturers. He's famous for taking apart an early Model 3 and heavily criticizing it; now he raves about how far Tesla is ahead of other manufacturers. And it's not just the car business; they make as many battery cells as they can and sell the extras to power grids. They're even starting up their own lithium refinery.- Finally, if you talk him out of his TSLA and TSLA goes to the moon then he's going to blame you for keeping him poor, move in with you, and complain about might-have-beens every day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:06:49'] Damn I am feeling sorry for you and your dad at this point because that's just going to make him lose so much in the name of stocks and TSLA, that's all I know lol.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:59:25'] TSLA is half of my portfolio, and even I think that's a risky move. The rest are in index, in case shit blows up.I think your father should diversify it, put most of the money in index and probably lower the Tesla holdings down to 15%.Because right now, your father's entire retirement savings relies on whether Elon tweets stupid shit or not. I wouldn't take the chances on that.&#x200B;FYI Im only 23.

There is no winning there.Instead, focus on him and you.  Tell him you think it's risky and you won't bail him out if turns sour.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 12:34:07'] You're crying about your dad all inning a top 10 company in the s&p in the age of ai and electric vehicles? Even buffet is 40% apple, and averaged up close to ATH at 160's earlier after regretting his 120 sells. This interest rate envrionment will further bankrupt their competition and cause steeper monopolization than ever before.By kelly criterion if he thinks there's a 90% chance tsla doubles from here (previous ATH) that's about 85% he should be invested in. That goes to 92.5% invested if he has 95% confidence.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 13:20:30'] Told my father to read, "The Intelligent Investor" . He said later on that he liked the book because it told you when to buy and when to sell. He has an MBA though and likes to research shit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:16:29'] Well for one, I would show him how it’s already made it’s 1000% move and has already had multiple stock splits since then which just increases the difficulty for it to do that again. And then the current P/E ratio is in the 40s so let’s low ball the expectation at 5x today for the next 10ish years. That would mean that Tesla would be nearly a 3T dollar company while also maintaining expectations of high growth to justify the high PE or massive profits and while adding 2.5T dollars into buying the stock. In other words in the next decade it will have to add the entire worth of apple on top of what’s already in it. The practicality alone would make me not bank on it happening, but then you got the troubles brewing with China relations, and all the boomers retiring with their capital fleeing from risky bets, and the increase competition, amongst the 10 other more speculative possible issues that I won’t get into. I haven’t looked into Teslas financials lately but you could def attempt a discounted cash flow or look at bullish projections of earnings and reverse engineer stock price based on if it maintains the PE or whatever. But while I wouldn’t tell him to not invest in Tesla, I definitely would tell him to diversify most of it. Oh also if he averaged up from 130$ it looks like he’s close to break even if not down, but either way just show the math on how quickly it could fall apart if the rug is pulled like a China factory close or calculate what happens when Elon has to use all his billions on Twitter and has to borrow with Tesla at these higher rates when they Barely escaped bankruptcy at low rates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:42:19'] I know people at my work who did this and were able to get over $1M in retirement savings before they turned 40. It's a huge gamble but investing in Tesla over the last 10 years had been an incredible return for them
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:51:06'] Damn your dad sounds fucking awesome.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:24:32'] This makes me gladder that I did something similar at 30. I lost tens of thousands after I had grand dreams of my windfall supporting me to start a real estate venture. I’ll recover and at worst, work one additional year and not retire as early, and I won’t ever make the mistake of putting more than a tiny amount of my money into any single stock. If I hadn’t learned that lesson now, I might have tried that at 58, and never been able to retire.Your father needs to get out of his position immediately, this is unbelievably risky. There is always a tiny, tiny chance that he does ok and gets a big gain, but if he does, I guarantee that he lets it ride and loses later, or he tries to replicate his luck and loses later. No way he wins in the end.

All 1’s in a single roll represents a total loss.A 20 sided dice is more accurate, but you get the idea. It’s a helluva lot harder to hit 6 of them at a shot.Of course none of this will work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:19:05'] If he plans to hold on until 2030 he will most likely be totally fine. This year is going to be maximum volatility for the immediate future. It's still incredibly risky at his age though. I rolled over my 401k in 2020 and went heavy into Tesla before the S&P inclusion and still had cash available when they announced the inclusion. Due to that I doubled it instead of just buying index funds since index funds had to buy Tesla. I was up over 250% in about a year, but due to my strategy of not trying to time the market, I went lower than my original investment once it dropped. It's now back above that, but it may be a rough year for Tesla meeting the growth targets. The current bear market has hit growth stocks hard. If we get out of the recession, than Tesla will easily rise above it's previous all time high if they keep growth and profitability in line. It's definitely no certain outcome, but their ambitions are sky high and with the vertical integration and extremely low debt overall, they have huge potential for growth this decade. Grid scale energy storage having endless growth potential, a Tesla compact vehicle, mass production of batteries internally, robotaxis and robotics are all in work for the decade which some of those projects could easily push Tesla into the multi trillion dollar range. Really, Elon has been the main issue lately for Tesla headwinds, but he was the guy who directed ship to the current valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 13:47:00'] You are thinking about this correctly. It's risky as hell.I made really good gains betting on Tesla prior to the pandemic. It became a pretty big part of my portfolio but it didn't start that way. Gains got it there. When the pandemic hit I got out, thinking the economy was going to crash. I delayed getting back in when it was clear that it wasn't, because Musk started acting very erratic (or showing his true self) turning off his primary customer base. The cars were getting more and more expensive and the promise of fully self-driving cars and robotaxis seemed further and further away. I'm back in to some degree because I see some positives in where Tesla is heading now (except the self-driving progress is still unclear) but I'm cautious. I'm in my 50's and I believe in preserving the gains I have and trying to grow them in a balanced way, not being overly aggressive.Tesla has a lot of strengths and advantages in their market, but there is also a shitton of risk. Musk is one of them. Everything relies on him and he is a loose cannon. What if something happens to him tomorrow? The competing car companies are working hard to catch up. Even if everything goes well, their PE does not nearly justify the stock price. They have a long way to go to make that equation work. Your dad may be right that the stock will shoot up dramatically over the next 3-5 years. Then again, it may not. Who knows? It's a bet, like any other bet. Bets like this should be hedged. Being really greedy tends to bite you in the ass. I used to work with a guy that was past retirement age but had to still work full time. This was after selling a company he owned. In his case it was because he lost everything to Bernie Madoff. He made a bet and it completely failed. I felt bad for him.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:30:09'] The hard truth is that it’s his money and he can invest however he wants with it. Personally, I’m not a fan of Tesla as a company nor am I a fan of Elon. That aside, I would recommend reviewing the company financials (10-K and 10-Q for example), the company leadership, their “moats”, risks, and their long term strategy amongst other things. I would then recommend he do his own financial analysis looking at free cash flow over his time horizon. If your dad has done this and understands what he’s reading and is still on board for Tesla, then so be it. But what you as an individual need to do is to understand how his decisions impact you. You then need to understand what his worst case scenario is and determine what your boundaries are. If the stock crashes and he cannot live off Tesla, are you going to support him? Provide him housing? Elderly care? Pay his bills? Call me heartless but I would not if my parents invested like this without a backup assets to generate cash flow in retirement.  Either way, you need to set your boundaries and expectations with your father. He may be relying on you as his fall back. On the flip side, investing in just one company is not inherently bad. If you understand the risks and the company then you can probably get away with it. But, you really really need to understand the business, it’s leadership, risks, the competition, the industry, and all the other ins and outs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:14:02'] He clearly likes Tesla. I think your best play here is to bring up the benefits of a etf to him that is heavily weighted in Tesla stock and offers some diversification. An actively managed ETF would do the rebalancing for him so as to not incur charges for buying and selling Tesla, he could even combine this with periods of tax loss harvesting to claim additional $ thereby maximising his upside potential.

He can run them 20-25% above the current stock price and make 25% per year on monthlies. If nothing else it will lower his cost basis on it.I personally agree with his assessment that it's a good long term hold. Don't let the near term fluctuations dissuade you from seeing what their disruptions to the market will do in 5-10 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 12:15:51'] There are some basic math stuff that proves out the utility of diversification, and it’s basically self evident once you break it down in those terms. But usually you have to start from basics and people don’t always have the attention span for that. Nobel prize winning economist and professor emeritus at Yale (if you need bonafides and authority to prove a point to your parent) has a free course at coursera which is pretty good. I think first few modules give you some nice history and some basic math around diversification. https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-globalIt is worth mentioning that diversification is more about wealth management and not necessarily about becoming wealthy, so risk management  might not resonate if they feel like they need to make up for lagging wealth with risk/reward trade offs.

That said, maybe introducing him to the stability of some ETFs might help him at least direct some future cash in another direction. Sell it as insurance and maybe pointing out that "If Tesla comes in, you already have enough in there to retire." If not maybe the insurance of a diversified ETF can make sure they don't struggle in retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 13:33:25'] TBH, much of the rest of the market looks almost as skanky as Tesla right now, and tech/growth is overvalued again. The broad market indexes will probably tank sometime after April 15. I wouldn't advise him to buy other stocks.He might want to buy gold, or gold shares like SGOL. Gold generally considered a safe haven asset and Central banks have been ramping up buying gold since the NATO countries seized Russia's sovereign wealth funds. 2023 is looking like another gold buying year as governments try to diversify out of the dollar, as its reserve currency appeal erodes due to sanctions and seizures. The nice thing about qualified retirement funds is that you don't pay the ridiculous precious metals tax when you have gains in a 401K fund. Also there are treasuries & munis that are paying 5-6% now, I believe.He should definitely sell chunks of Tesla stock and buy at least some safe haven stuff like gold and high interest treasuries & munis.

Since inception, TSLA has enjoyed the euphoria phase: the only all EV manufacturer, Musk fanboys, and promises of FSD and so on.  There was a shared vision that TSLA would take over all autos, all personal transport, and everything involving electricity.  Essentially, a new age for man.Today, TSLA is reverting to the mean and being evaluated like normal stocks.  It still has value and potential, but the shine is wearing thin.  Look at Master Plan 3, it's totally lame.  To me TWTR is a huge problem.  Musk is under a huge amount of stress and unlike the Solar City acquisition, Musk won't be able to brush it under the success of TSLA.  So, with all that said, I don't think you should stress about your dad.  He's a grown ass man.  Maybe he will 10x his money, maybe he'll lose 50%.

Assuming that he's a good parent, he may only be thinking of the consequences of his actions in terms of how they affect him, and if he thinks that you're going to be burdened with taking care of him in the event that his gamble doesn't pay off he might reconsider.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:20:56'] Fortunately TSLA is the lead in the EV industry and your father has seen how gas efficient cars became big the last century. Wisdom does come with age. May be onto something. But 100% in is risky. Still think the odds of payoff are higher than loss over time. And therein is the question, does he have enough time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:22:17'] He may have made the right choice!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:22:37'] Unfortunately this is more common than you think. And most of the time this behavior is coming from a normally functioning adult, who tends to act rationally about anything else. I've heard this story n number of times either from a friend or a friend of a friend and whether its $TSLA or $NVDA, the rationale tends to be the same. "I'm financially behind my peers, I need to take on bigger risk to compensate."What's even more unfortunate is that these are the people (especially in his life stage) who've probably been fiscally responsible up until this point. The funny thing about investing is that you only truly understand your risk tolerance once you've blown up. Most successful investors and traders advocate this as a necessary learning experience. In the case of your dad, I don't blame him if this is his situation but the fallout will be brutal. The only thing I can suggest is for him to reduce his overall exposure by selling half of his shares, and putting 10% into leaps. That way, if he's ultra-bullish he can capitalize on the upside.This is an extreme opinion, but if you're up for the challenge maybe this will change his mind.Your dad probably knows this, but tell him how in every bubble the vast majority of investors lose money. That's basically what makes it a bubble, right? If a lot of people didn't lose a lot of money than it wouldn't be a bubble. Conversely, there are always the few people who make it out with their shirts and they're most likely either 1. connected 2. rich 3. an expert (someone who was an industry expert before the bubble happened) 4. an institution, or 5. extremely lucky. Now ask your dad, is he any of these? No. He is exactly the prototype of the "retail" investor who loses their shirt from this bubble. It's not the well-connected VC folks who invested in $TSLA back in 2009. It's not the wealthy ultra high-net worth individuals who's money is managed by a family office. It's not the battery scientist who's been tinkering with EV technology since 2012. It's not BlackRock who sees and hears everything. And it's not the lucky guy who bought $TSLA in 2014 because he thought the cars looked cool.You can't just think of the wealth destruction of a bubble popping when $TSLA goes from $400 to $100. Look at the recent reports, the amount of $$$ retail is plowing directly into $TSLA the past 3 months is staggering. THESE are the "chumps" who become the bag-holders. The true wealth destruction is when $TSLA goes from $100 to $200, sucks in as many retail investors as it can so the folks from #1 - #5 can offload their positions, then goes down to $50. Right now is exactly when retail is left holding the bag. There's a really good reason why most bubble charts look the same. Whether it's $TSLA, $CSCO back in the dot-com bubble, Bitcoin, or the Dutch East India in the 1700s. At the end of the day, speculation and bubbles are driven by human greed that never changes. What also never changes is that that only the minority end up winning big (category #1-#5) and they're the ones cashing out during the initial plunge and the initial bull trap recovery. It's always the normal investors who missed out on the initial gravy train that jump in too late with eager eyes and end up getting hurt the most.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:23:26'] Your dad is a smart guy
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:32:21'] I wouldn't approach this from an investment advice standpoint, but from a "what's your plan for retirement/life if TSLA dips significantly" standpoint. Because that's, as a child, really the only place you're involved. If TSLA does something stupid and the stock goes significantly down to 2020 levels, is your dad planning to move in with you? Live off his social security?  Work until he keels over and dies? Investing all your retirement savings in *any* single stock is a huge gamble.  And if he ends up losing it all and relying on his kids for financial support in his retirement and old age, that becomes a gamble he's taking with your life, not his.  Be kind, but frame this as a future planning for your family's happiness conversation, not a "is TSLA a good stock" conversation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:32:37'] Ask him - What happens to TSLA if something happens to Elon Musk?  Not wishing bad on anyone, but people with more protection have been assassinated before, for example.    There is the normal human death risk too, but Elon is such a polarizing figure nowadays that I’m sure the risk that something happens to him outsizes the risk to a normal person of his age.    Your dad is betting his entire life savings on 1 man’s success, health, ability to stay alive, etc.

Maybe you’d have better luck trying to get him to take enough money off the Tesla table to re-coup his cost-basis, and let the rest ride.  His first / base investment should be in an index fund (you might entice him with a historic chart of gains over a decade).  Right now he’ll make out well having some of that cash parked in a mutual fund (good interest).  You could introduce him to government backed, high interest “I Bonds”.

If he’s already behind, look at his options as far as he’s concerned.1: Fuck it, we ball. Five to one odds against, but he could get lucky and find himself with enough to retire. Or not, and he find himself without enough to retire.2: Do the safe, sensible thing and invest in a target date fund. Everything goes perfectly, and he *still* doesn’t have enough for retirement. Why would you play a game you’re certain to lose, when you could play one you might win? I know it’s a logical fallacy, because the two aren’t equivalent, but they sure as hell look like it. Being unable to retire is being unable to retire.

The point is to plant that seed of doubt in his mind so that he may decide on his own to reduce his exposure to tesla on his own, and he will feel like he made the decision himself and he wasn’t influenced by you.

I thought they had a couple more years of being able to run wild before really having to adjust so much to face stiffer competition.  If that's the case already, then you have to wonder how things will look when more of the big boys really start to ramp up production.Anyway I likely never will own any Tesla equity directly (only through index funds) because their share price is never rational.

Electric propulsion, Ai powered cruise controls are cool features they have a narrow lead on, not any exclusivity. Legacy auto will be more than ready to keep its market share when the electric car buying really ramps up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:29:22'] Overreact and sell if you want to. I'll be buying at the lower prices. In a few years time Telsa will be still be increasing production, cutting costs, and announcing new factories. The competition will be fighting to sell a significant number at profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:35:24'] unit growth and topline is still good considering amount of price cuts seen. but huge drop in GM/OM. Big question is CT launch. Its April and they are just saying later this year. Dont think CT will have any impact on top line this year. Plus with no M2 for another 2 years(if we have to wait for Mexico GF to go online) at minimum, I think growth will stall unless they decrease price even more which is hard to see with the margins seen.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/25/tesla-elon-musk-ford-jim-farley-ev-twitter-spaces-talk.html\n\nFord Motor will partner with Tesla on several charging initiatives for its current and future electric vehicles in an unusual tie-up between the two rivals, CEOs of the automakers announced Thursday.\n\nThe deal includes current Ford owners being granted access to 50% of Teslas coveted Supercharger network, followed by Fords next-generation of EVs that are expected by mid-decade to include Teslas charging plug. The design will allow owners of the vehicles to charge at Tesla superchargers without an adaptor, making Ford the first to do so.\n\nThe initiatives were announced by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Tesla CEO Elon Musk during a live, audio discussion on Twitter, which Musk currently leads. The CEOs announced the surprise discussion earlier in the afternoon.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 15:00:50'] Elon also said something to the effect Tesla isn't against open sourcing their software similar to how Android does for smartphones. I suspect this is the beginning of more partnerships to come.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 16:54:56'] Can't stand Elon Musk whatsoever BUT this is a welcomed sign and great for customers. If I was going to get an EV it would be a Ford and this helps solidify that idea.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:55:47'] This isn’t a surprise. This is directly a result of Biden’s EV initiatives and his administration’s new NEVI standards recently announced. Biden is pushing companies to work together to meet this new fast-charging standard so this doesn’t become another AT&T phone poll monopoly type of issue.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:06:51'] I wonder if it means Tesla will also be able to use Ford's charging network. I would assume it will eventually be the case.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 02:09:35'] Great news, why not make all chargers the same anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 04:22:58'] One of the most common negatives for Ford EV buyers has been charging difficulties and accessibility.  So this move strongly bolsters Ford on what was one of their biggest weaknesses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 04:54:45'] Why wouldn't Tesla let all EV makers use their superchargers?  Charging isn't free, right?  Drivers use a mobile app to pay for charging, so, when someone uses a Tesla supercharger, Tesla gets paid, not Ford.  They own the superchargers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 05:13:38'] It’s a bit like using USB-C for charging vs having to make a proprietary system for each brand. Seems like an absolute no brainer to me.

I guess I have a similar story where I was gonna buy a whole Bitcoin back in June of 2020 when it was roughly 5k but backed out because I thought it was too risky lol. I also wanted to buy a thousand dollars worth of Tesla back in March 2020 when it was roughly 300 bucks a share (pre split). I decided not to invest in it because someone who I had known who had a lot of experience investing in the stock market told me not to. This was also my very first time putting any money in the stock market, and I was extremely hesitant about putting my hard earned money into something I essentially thought was a gamble.If anything this experience taught me that you just gotta follow your gut when it comes to everything in life including investing lol.

Mine include buying some things that have tanked and not buying more shares of things that skyrocketed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 05:28:57'] Stop thinking about it, it's not worth it. Ok, think how you could do it better the next time, but don't be sad/mad about the past, cope.

It's better to have a small win, because of a triggered sl than to think about the possible winnings if you would have let them run. Ask yourself why you want to sell. Are the stocks not good anymore, because of bad fundamentals?

I held on to it for about a year and wanted to hold it longer, but I needed the money so I sold it at $6. It went up to $23 a share about a month later. I could have really used that right about now. Felt sick for months thinking about it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:37:47'] If you sold because you were managing your risk or had other opportunities, there’s nothing wrong with this inherently as this is standard portfolio management and you should do this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:32:11'] Yes, I planned on buying bitcoin for £7000 when it was worth £1 and never went through with it, then when it was £270 I tried to buy a miner from a company called Butterfly labs and had my money stuck with them and no miner to show for it for a year and half and after the US feds got involved I was offered bitcoin approx turned out to be 0.9 from their cloud mining platform Vs a refund, so as I had already waited this long and was not sure how to safely buy it anyway went for the bitcoin, which I later invested with BitConnect and the rest is history...  So maybe not a stock & shares regret but maybe you can relate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:49:23'] Something which may help is to understand that if you 'invest actively', regret is absolutely inevitable. Once you have an idea to do something, whether you do or don't do it, you might regret it, and there are only 2 solutions to this (1) Don't invest (2) Be completely passive (buy the index robotically every month). If you are going to be active, then this just comes with the territory. See it as a cost of doing business.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 16:34:57'] Regret depends on whether my mindset was investor or trader. Sounds like you had a trader approach so it shouldn't bother you as much. When I was in trader mode, I bought TSLA at split-adjusted $4.00 and sold for $4.60 (in 2011). It doesn't haunt me though because at the time I was a swing trader and 15% in-and-out was a win. What haunts me is like selling MSFT at $185 in early 2020 just before covid hit, thinking covid will kill the market. Which it did, but I expected the downturn to last longer than a month. That was an investment and not a trade, as I'd held those shares for 15 years since the $25-$30 range.

POST_TEXT: b'https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said Tesla\'s price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.\n\nAt a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla\'s attempts to increase sales were "completely rational and should surprise no one."\n\nElon Musk\'s company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla\'s entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.\n\nIn January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.\n\n"Price wars are breaking out everywhere," Farley said. Who\'s going to blink for growth?"\n\nTesla\'s price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 06:17:09'] As someone who would love to own an EV in the future, I say I welcome a price war!I wonder how VW can respond? They've been Pushing into EVs for awhile now. You'd think they'd be closer to making them profitably.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:50:04'] Isn’t commoditization the point? I thought the goal was to make EV’s accessible to the masses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:27:47'] Oh no! Anyway. Sounds great for customers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:32:58'] Is this Elon using his margins as a weapon?  As far as I know all EV manufacturers are operating at a loss with current EV models but Tesla is still making 11% margin.  They could potentially drop prices and still make a profit where legacy automakers have no room in their prices. He’s definitely putting pressure on other automakers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:49:12'] I would listen to Jim Farley. I heard his cousin used to live in a van down by the river.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 06:12:07'] Share pricing aside, people should appreciate how much Tesla can hold the legacy automakers hostage on prices. Automakers followed their best customers up market with better products at better prices, and neglected to invest in EVs when it was still early. Clayton Christensen would add this onto his list of companies avoiding the rebar of society, only to later be eaten by the minimills.And looking forward, with Teslas infrastructure, it isn't going to get any easier for legacy. They need to focus on making the EVs they do sell incredible, use their time in the industry to beat tesla on experience since they can't on price. But even the advances in self driving aren't really slowing down, and all without Lidar.Legacy is more worried about Tesla than a lot of the regular and investing public might think.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 08:56:56'] As much as people love to hate on Tesla, I think we need to understand just positive it is that companies like Tesla can lower their price so much and even eat into their margins while still staying positive forcing these LICE companies who already sell their EVs at a loss to make really tough decisions, take a bigger loss or improve their process 10 fold to survive. Either way, we the consumer end up getting better products at a better price.Right now the only thing stopping me from going EV is the price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:10:34'] How much money does Ford make on each Mach E they sell?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 06:42:15'] Price cuts is definitely not something you wanna see as a shareholder.But here is the thing, they cut because they can, probably not because they want to but dropping from 21% net income profit to 19% is way more manageable than other EV's dealer whose car aren't profitable or barely.Tesla is about to produce a butt load of cars and the focus is less about pricing a much more about actual selling.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 14:59:06'] I'd prefer an "available" war
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:50:35'] That's exactly what we want
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:29:09'] Tesla still has the biggest margin per vehicle by far. They're trying to force the competition to lose even more money per vehicle. Competitors have to scale and improve their designs all while selling cars at a loss. They have challenging times ahead.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:18:01'] Considering EVs are the future and like them or not it’s all you can buy after 2035. Having a price war is a benefit to consumers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:33:12'] These guys are screwed.  They have been counting on people paying a premium for EVs on top of the way they jacked up prices for ICE cars to fund their transition to EVs.  The dagger in the heart is Detroit has never been able to compete  in the affordable car market.  For decades it has been one long retreat, so now all they really have is trucks, giant SUVs, and nostalgia vehicles like muscle cars.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:47:30'] Tesla were audacious, and re-wrote the book on what a car could be - but they aren't luxury cars.  They're plasticky and cheap, with poor fit and finish, more on par with Mazda than BMW.They can't sell Mazdas at BMW prices forever.Either they are coming down to earth and getting real...or, if they really mean to start an EV price war?  They are going to lose, big time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:32:13'] Listen to what he says, Ford is welcoming a price war because it hurts its competition not theim as they focus on different market segment and products. A price war might be good for the EV transition, wich is fine to me, but it might not be for automakers or automakers shareholders including Tesla shareholders. I don't like the guy nor the brand, and even if I have to admit I see more and more of theim in my country, the general concenssus is that they are all marketing gagdetisation with low quality products for a still high price. It worked for Apple before, but some likeminded people as me will always stay away from those brands. I wish the legacy automakers, who are no doubt lagging behind, to catch UP and win the race with better finished cars. No hard feelings
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:33:26'] It certainly will be interesting, but I wonder if this war can extend to ICE cars because that’s what I am looking for, not interested in an EV at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 08:36:54'] This is what I've been saying for years. I dgaf about Tesla's margins now or last year. The end state is going to be 3+ big competitors, probably 6+, who all have cutthroat competition on prices. No company is going to maintain high margin *and* high volume.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 08:43:53'] Jim is getting scared because they know they have no way of competing against the Tesla on price but they have to go in on EVs as the future, so it’s a current lose lose for legacy automotive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:45:38'] "The regulator said the vehicles concerned did not allow drivers to turn off regenerative braking or provide enough warnings when drivers stepped on the accelerator pedal hard, which, combined, could increase the risk of collision.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html\n\nTesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Teslas largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.\n\nSome analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Teslas industry-leading profit margins could be at risk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:01:17'] Overpriced to begin with now you can see the profit margin.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 06:32:14'] Quick, time to do something funny with twitter!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 06:42:07'] I'm looking forward to the figures to see if the cuts are lowering their profit margin. Economy of scale and all that. Curious to see how other manufacturers react, especially the ones who are currently making EVs at a loss. Do they lower prices too to try and compete, making an even bigger loss or rely on their own brand loyalty for people to pay their asking price to minimise their losses. Must be hard for the likes of Ford and VW who are making good decisions and relatively close to being profitable on EVs  just to see Tesla lower prices whenever it suits them to put the pressure on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 10:01:01'] Seems to lack context. Their highest volume product is the Model Y and this price cut brings the price back down to where it was in January.They cut prices in January, raised prices, and then cut prices back down to the same amount.The Model Y Long Range is still priced above the 2021 pricing. The Model 3 standard range also received price cuts, but it is still above its 2021 pricing too. Model S/X pricing still above 2021 pricing too, by about $5,000.As for margins, we will see. There will be some margin compression as guided by their CFO. Remember, it isn't just prices, it's cost of goods sold too. The costs of materials has been dropping a lot as the supply chains are also getting back to "normal." Plus, Tesla's scale is much higher than 2021 with better fixed cost absorption. Their new factories in Austin and Berlin have achieved 4,000/week and 5,000/week peak rates respectively, which is going to help with margins. Furthermore, the IRA tax credits provide production tax credits that dramatically lower the cost of battery cell production.So we will see at their earnings release how all this shakes out in terms of margins - it is quite a fluid situation with a lot of different variables.Note that in the US, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Nissan Ariya all do not have any IRA EV tax credit. The Ford Mach-E is getting cut in half to $3,750. All of these have pricing problems.Ford Mach-E California Route 1: $57,995 - $3,750 = $54,245Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE AWD: $50,335 - $0 = $50,335Kia EV6 Wind (e-AWD): $52,600 - $0 = $52,600Nissan Ariya Engage+ e-4ORCE AWD: $51,190 - $0 = $51,190Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD: $52,990 - $7,500 = $45,490Many dealerships are still asking for mark ups over MSRP, while you don't get that with Tesla. Also, the Model Y is a much larger vehicle in terms of interior cargo space, especially compared to the Ioniq 5 and has access to the best DCFC network in the US.  It's 70 mph range is also substantially higher.Winter range, tested by Bjorn at 75 mph:Ford Mach-E LR AWD: 163 milesHyundai Ioniq 5 AWD (summer, so higher than winter range): 180 milesKia EV6 AWD: 170 milesNissan Ariya 87 kWh FWD: 181 miles, AWD version should be about 10% less.Model Y LR AWD: 203 milesAs a result, Tesla is squeezing the competition with price cuts and will continue to ride their cost curve down. Everyone else is going to have to respond, or just continue to see very low marketshare. Ford has had to cut prices, and will likely have to cut them again. Things are so dire in China for the Mach-E that Ford has cut the starting price down to 209,900 yuan, or \~$30,500.

If you watch the video of the new factory in Berlin and compare it to the GM EV line, it’s decades ahead. https://www.google.ca/search?q=giga+berlin&client=safari&hl=en-ca&prmd=nmiv&source=lnms&tbm=vid&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY196HnJj-AhUSCDQIHZblA_4Q_AUoBHoECAQQBA&biw=390&bih=661&dpr=3#fpstate=ive&ip=1&vld=cid:091c723a,vid:7-4yOx1CnXE,st:0

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 11:26:10'] People are acting like Tesla just cut their prices in half while paying 50% more for material. As the only EV that qualifies for the tax credit, this price credit isn’t definitely not due to a demand issue, but what do I know. Start the down votes please
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 08:07:05'] TSLA is mangling this badly. If you were going to cut prices, do it intentionally and some thought and do it once.These repeated price cuts now has potential (probable) Tesla customers holding off on a purchase because they don’t want Elon to devalue their car more than it already would be once it’s driven off the lot.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 13:28:58'] People may wonder what Tesla's margins will be, but people wonder if there will even BE a profit at all the other EV makers. (legacy makes money with ICE, but any price reductions by legacy auto on EVs means they lose more money then before on each sale) Q1 is always the weakest quarter. The more Tesla lowers prices, the sooner the competition goes bankrupt because they are in a much worse position.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:20:43'] Tesla is trying to have a price war because it can still make a profit while all other manufacturers are losing money on their EVs. That might work against some of the smaller manufacturers, but the bigger ones will survive this price war. Another problem Tesla is facing are tired, outdated looking models. Tesla needs to do some major redesigns. The first mover advantage is diminishing. Tesla will have to start burning some major cash if it’s going to redesign its models (which it should), but it’ll be doing that while it’s profit margin is shrinking and while it’s burning cash trying to get production started on the models it’s previously announced. All in all, Tesla stock is likely going to see some pain because earnings are going to suffer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 20:21:16'] Analysts are apparently stupid. You do realize I hope, that Tesla’s costs are cut by 28% every time production doubles. This is due to Wrights Law. Tesla has such a huge lead in EV that they will be the price setter for the market. As Tesla scales up to 11 million vehicles, costs will drop 28% when it hits 2.8million and another 28% when it hits 5.6 million and another 28% when it hits 11.2 million in the next 6-7 years. Like clockwork. Don’t worry about margins, worry about how fast they can scale
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:48:55'] I think they want to sell as many cars as possible. Something seems to be on the horizon that we don’t know about or don’t want to know about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 08:54:11'] Seems like EV manufacturing costs would scale better than ICE, just on account of it being simpler (a modern ICE is very intricate with many more parts and low tolerance). I’m curious how low EV initial prices could be while still netting a decent profit margin. Otherwise, the long term costs of ownership once at scale will be interesting.. fewer constant maint costs and more larger lump-sum costs, eg no gas and oil changes but eventually you’ll need to replace the battery.

On one hand you have Tesla with Margins are nearly an order of magnitude higher than most of the legacy mfgr's when it comes to EV's - they they have a LOT of room to move in that spread.On the other hand, GM/Ford/Ram/et.al are still selling bucket loads of highly profitable ICE powered Trucks and SUV's - which they can/are using that profit to subsidize their money losing (or very low profit) EV's...at least for the time being.What remains to be seen is who can leverage their own advantages (margin vs. internal ICE subsidies) over the medium term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 12:17:49'] I am no expert but do have some experience with the car industry. Generally, the car industry is cyclical, it's a big purchase that people will avoid for multiple reasons including economic downturn, interest rate, job market, etc. As of now it does not generate subscription based revenue. They have a massive cost of manufacturing that doesn't scale well as software or subscription based models. Hence, the low PE ratios for almost all car industries. Tesla has the advantage of having far greater margins, some level of subscription revenue and no dealerships sucking off their margins. They also had incredible pricing power. Now with competition finally catching up they are strategically putting pressure on other manufacturers. Manufacturers, apart from Tesla, are already under extreme pressure with thin margins on electric vehicles during initial period. They can't go any lower but Tesla can.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 05:47:33'] In the EU there have been moves in the legislature to make all chargers compatible with all EVs.

But when it comes to the rest of the world I don't think this is going to be a Tesla competitive advantage for very long. The green transition and its roll out is more important than the profits of one (foreign) company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 05:48:58'] I am curious if Tesla would spin off their super charging network into a fully fledged subsidiary.  I am not saying it is a good idea one way or another but it would allow investors to understand better if this is a loss leader or a true source of profits.  The issues with support other makes is there are some states which are pushing really hard for a POS interface complete with screens and credit card reader. This of course is all in support of taxing charging sessions by kWh or total sale. You know it is coming and the politicians want their share.    The issue for Tesla owners is some very tight stations might be even worse off with waiting times. Now Tesla could use a color coding system to designate which chargers work with CCS or SC and even a third color denoting both.  However regardless of the silly title, Tesla doesn't face an ultimatum. The US government does. They need the Tesla charging network far more than Tesla needs the governments money.

IIRC Tesla's patents are open, so would that not imply that any incompatibility is a design decision on the part of Tesla's competitors?That said, one way or another there has to be a standard.  Infrastructure is a clear natural monopoly situation and this market will be regulated down to the wires if it can't organize on its own.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 13:18:30'] Elon built those Charging Stations with Government money. Open them up or tax the hell out of Tesla! It’s only fair!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-14 16:39:04'] People seem to forget that Tesla invented their charging design before there was a standard. Their design is older than CCS and still better than it. Not only that, other "standards" have come and go in the mean time.Tesla is the oldest design and still the best. Tesla isn't "apple forcing crappy lightning". Tesla invented USB-C and invited others to use it many years ago when they unveiled the first superchargers. Since then, the auto industry invented USB-A, Lightning, Serial ports, and other junk. Tesla stayed with their standard all along.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 09:18:08'] Tesla charging port was released patent free to allow everyone to use it. Instead, we are now swamped with countless charger ports (some of them are awful). Tesla has the best charging plugs and it's a shame they have to adapt and not the other way around.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 11:56:31'] The funny thing here is that Telsa removed the patents around it's charging plug.  So any EV automaker can use the same plug in their EV's and not have to pay a licensing fee to Tesla.  Yet the government is going to punish Tesla to make it's chargers open for other automakers.  Why not force all EV automakers to use a standard plug (Tesla in this case since they have the largest existing network).  Then Tesla just has to setup a way to detect non Tesla EV's and setup a payment system.

The lack of commonality is the biggest impediment to EV adoption... Since Tesla has the largest network, the change should be on backs of electrify america (maybe Tesla should just pay (pass-through the $7B government funds to) electrify america to make their plugs compatible with Tesla).The end result would be tesla plug is the standard and Tesla doesn't have to update anything (other than changes to software allowing non tesla  cars to connect.)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 09:38:07'] It already did it in Europe and it will in the states.  And Tesla can put up high quality chargers faster than anyone else.  The US would be foolish to not partner with tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 09:42:55'] Dumb if they dont. The growth potential, having the patent on the hookups will make them sooooo much more money then the cars themselves. I dunno, i figured this was the game of elon. Build the infrastructure, sell car companies the parts for the infrastructure, be subsidized from the government. Win Win Win for the next 50-100 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 10:16:48'] Tesla could possibly retrofit their current superchargers without making it a worse experience for Tesla owners. They could have each charger be able to charge a Tesla and a standard charging car at the same time. Have the spaces face each other. Obviously this would take construction, leasing more space, and other work. But it is possible
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 10:25:58'] Reminds me of how every cell phone used to have its own charging end. Glad those days are gone!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 10:54:14'] Telsa needs to look at 2 numbersHow long it would take to make 7.5B on their network in charge fees, and is it worth it to let their competitors use their system, basically slowing availability for tesla customers and to the benefit of off brands?&#x200B;how much does it cost to build 40k new stations for the other competitors/  is it more than 7.5B ?&#x200B;if the second is higher than 7.5 and the first is a short term of time - then tesla tells gov to go fuck themselves.  build your own network.  see you in 10 years when you catch up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 12:12:02'] Why is Tesla likely losing money to foot the bill on EV infrastructure for companies that wouldn't have otherwise designed EVs to compete with Tesla in the first place.If they want the compatibility, they should sign to build at least as many charging stations and absolve Tesla from building more until they match.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 12:18:34'] Back when the superchargers were a free service, it made a lot of sense that they be proprietary. Now that they are a fee based system, it makes sense that they would be open to all vehicles.It'll take a few years to retrofit, but I bet that they are working on the transition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 12:25:49'] Not really fair considering the big news media, tech and banks monopoly
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 12:57:22'] Think Tesla will open up their network soon to all cars, however they’re going to charge a lot more for other manufacturers to charge and give Tesla owners a discount. Win win situation for the company.

This unusual stock options activity is likely from a large investor.\n\nThe Unusual Stock Options Activity on May 30 showed that there were 13,039 put options traded at the $202.50 strike price for expiration on June 2, this Friday.

The second tranche was way out-of-the-money (OTM) since the $310 call strike price is 54% higher than today's price. \n\nBut interestingly, both had very similar prices.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 09:49:42'] They didn’t announce the new lineup because it will cannibalise today’s sales. The M3 and MY will continue to sell, the Cybertruck will ramp up next year and sell. They will use all of that money to invest in new factories to create the hatchback, van and Robotaxi efficiently. What I got from that is that consumers can choose between a cheap Ford or Toyota or a new Tesla for less money. Once the production ramps up the auto industry will change significantly.

Elons focussed on Twitter, white fragility, spaceX, hyperloop, moving to Texas from CA then back to CA, responding to fan boys on Twitter. No product plans or specifics on an investor day. Investors rewarded his poor prep and wasting their time with climate101 by dropping the stock more than 5%.

No real info on how fast they are ramping up 4680 cells (back in 2020 they were talking as if it will be mass production mode in 2022 changing the battery landscape). Plus continuous delay of their products launched previously. Biggest of all the small car launch is also delayed big time. they will have to get the Mexico GF built before that can be started and I am not convinced they will directly jump to new platform with new GF. Probably 2026 or later. Plus I dont even have to mention so called "FSD". its a L2 system that is no where close to being called FSD. Its already valued like a tech company. Let us see how they navigate various issues as they sell more and more cars. They had to reduce price big time to get demand and I am not convinced even that is long term sustainable as even after discount, its still an expensive car. They need a cheaper car for next level of growth and that is not happening in the near future. &#x200B;I would rather bet on BYD than TSLA at this point.

POST_TEXT: b'First of all, I understand I may be beating a dead horse here, so I apologize. I also know Tesla is a highly polarizing stock to discuss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 00:03:58'] People in here are focusing way too much on the US. Chinas auto market is twice the size and growing. Going forward, there will be more cars sold in China than in the EU and US combined. Performance in China will be make or break for Tesla. They've been doing well lately, but competition is strong and they've had to cut prices significantly. It won't be easy to keep matching the prices of Chinese brands in the future. Keep an eye on further developments in China and don't underestimate chinese nationalism when it comes to brand preference (the same is true for the EU btw: european brands will always have the home advantage there).Personally, I'm long on BYD.https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-electric-car-drive-led-by-byd-leaves-global-brands-behind-2023-04-17/
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:04:30'] There are many factors as to why Tesla is doing so well, and I personally think many traders are missing when they are discussing about Tesla stock. Below are just some points as to why I am buy a lot of this stock.1. Tesla was the company that popularize EV, and it has a good head start because ford/GM decided to abandon the first ev project. They were the true pioneer, but for some reason quit.2. Tesla tax break in the US which help reduce the cost of the car. At the moment, Tesla is is the cheapest EV car you can buy due to government's subsidies and the current relation automakers have with the auto sellers. Additionally, when you compound this with the cost of markup, it is very easy to understand why you are seeing more Tesla. Last summer, I wanted to buy a Mach E, but when I wen to the dealer, there was a $15,000 markup on top of MSRP. My family ended up getting another Tesla (model y) because it is the value. Have you tried purchasing the EV F-150 that you can find? There is a motherfucking $30,000 markup at the dealer. it's insane.3. As for build quality, I can tell you that after owning 3 Tesla, it is a hit or miss with this company. However, I can also say the same for other car makers. You are going to run into defects. Nevertheless, do you know why many people still prefer a Tesla over other brands? Tesla will fix all of the defects of their cars for free--3 years warranty--and give you a $100/day uber allowance for the trouble. Even if you are out of warranty, they will fix some defects for free too. For the simple stuff, they will send someone out to wherever your car is to fix the problem. In contrast with other automakers/dealers, they nickel and dime you for everything that they can. 4. Tesla are amazing car to drive. The handling and speed is the best bang for the buck you can get. There is something about the car that feel good. 5. Tesla doesn't just sell car. Tesla sale insurance, power(supercharger), car repair, and charging format. It is cheaper to insure a Tesla through their insurance than to another insurance. They have the most charging stations in the world which is one of the reasons why government are asking them to share their charging station with other makers. Tesla is agreeing with this because there is current a format war for charging adapters. There are currently 4-5 format (think USB vs thunderbolt plug), and it looks like Tesla is winning even though there are faster and better charging adapters. The best and cheapest place to repair your Tesla is at a Tesla location. In short, they are the monopoly for their car.6. It doesn't help that the current charging station for other car companies are poorly maintained and frustrating to use. Tesla makes it very easy to charge at their station. Get in and get out. Plus they are always functioning because people are always using them. 7. The current sentiment for the Asian culture (Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc.) is Tesla is a luxury brand car--beating Lexus. Ever noticed how almost every middle class Vietnamese or Chinese drive an RX 300 series? Well, now they are driving Tesla. This is the reason why you are seeing such huge spike in Tesla sales in China. 8. The company is purely data driving. Ask anyone who has worked for Tesla and they can tell you that the company only car about data and nothing else. Everything they do is data driven. The ups and downs of Tesla price is driven by this data. They know exactly how much people are willing to pay for the car. For example, the recent price cut is mainly to kill Tesla competitors. In a time when Tesla is making $20,000+ profit per car, its competitors are losing $20,000 to $100,000 per car. This is insane numbers. You don't think so? Wait until this week earning for Tesla's competitors, and look at how Ford is losing money per ev car. 9. Elon Musk is a dick, but you cannot argue against his killer instinct when it comes to how he run Tesla. The decision to dump millions into building charging station for free and giving early adopters free charging for the life of the car was insane at the time. However, in hindsight, those were some killer instinct decision making that made Tesla what it is today. With that said, Elon has so much control over Tesla that he can make any changes based on the data the company is collection without the board approval. Overall, there are many reasons as to why Tesla will do well in the future and for Cathie Wood's high valuation. I know she sounds like a crazy lady sometime, but from my perspective, Tesla is building itself up to be a monopoly for EV car. This is similar to the how people adopted the Apple's ecosystem. Tesla reach the tipping point of adopters into its ecosystem, it will be interesting to see what kind of company it will be. If you think all Tesla is selling is car, I think you are missing the bigger picture. Tesla major product right now is car. However, in the next 5 years, I'm more incline to believe it will be the seller of energy (think gas for your car) than just a car company due to it winning the format war. The only way for Tesla to lose this format war is for the majority of automaker to come together and agree upon one format for charging. However, as someone who have family members working for Hyundai, Ford, and Toyota, it is unlikely this will happen. These guys all think they can take on the EV giant because they are a legacy automaker. To me, we are looking at a transition from blackberry to Iphone, but in the form of cars. Nevertheless, this isn't  to say I am a full bull of Tesla. I love the fact that people are constantly shitting on the company. This constant shitting on Tesla has created many opportunities to buy in and create incredible volatility. Trading Tesla is the most fun I have every week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:53:59'] TLDR: All EV companies share the same benefits listed below, not just Tesla, and it is a benefit of being a new EV company vs. a legacy ICE company."just another car company" people know nothing about the car industry. The legacy automakers don't make their car parts, they design them and then assemble the cars. They outsource all of the parts to subcontractors who take all of the profit margins and none of the risks. Tesla meanwhile is almost completely vertically integrated and keeps all of the profit margins for the car they produce. This means they can sell far fewer cars and make far more profit.The second thing is that legacy automakers are legally not allowed to sell direct to consumer and have exclusive contracts with dealerships to sell their cars. This further puts constraints on their profit margins and limits their ability to adapt to market forces. Look at the last two years, dealerships were selling cars far above MSRP and the legacy automakers saw none of those additional profits. Tesla and the other new automakers have found ways around the laws against direct to consumer sales so are able to keep all of the profit margins from dealerships and get to benefit from all of the market forces that drive up prices. This is the eternal weakness of all franchise models dialed up to 11.Third, EV cars have a completely different supply chain compared to ICE cars and it is very expensive to set up, but the incremental costs are very low for manufacturing. As compared to ICE cars where most of the cost per car is in the incremental costs. Most of this is in the complexity of ICE cars compared to EVs which translates into large part counts and large labor costs for ICE cars vs. EVs. This will make it easier to fully automate an EV plant where you'll always need high skill, highly paid employees for an ICE factory.Finally, EVs companies don't have union expenses, pension expenses, legacy employer costs, etc. This adds a lot of overhead that legacy automakers have to pay that brand new companies don't. It is easier to be a 20 year old company vs. a 100+ year old company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 02:43:44'] Lot's already been said here, but I just wanted to point out that this is wrong:> From my understanding, although Tesla is involved in solar to some capacity, around 90+% of Tesla revenue comes from vehicle sales (I believe the number is 93% vehicle sales).This includes Tesla's automotive software sales, like FSD, autopilot, performance boosts, etc. Software is currently ~5% of Tesla's revenue, so if you back that out automotive revenue is "only" ~88%. More importantly though, if you look at profits software is ~20% of Tesla's total (gross) profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:02:56'] Ford has 100% negative margin right now on their EVs, at least the lose more per car produced than they sell it for. I think they are aiming to be net zero or above in 2027. VW has given up on China. GM is way behind and Toyota hasn’t even started. The bet would be that TSLA can keep their lead, but they would need to introduce more vehicle models to get to 10M units a year. Besides personal animus for Musk, the main bear case is that TSLA will either began to significantly lose market shares to competitors or they will lose their appeal as they become more commonplace.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 17:28:51'] I hope the push higher is to 225 but still waiting for 2500 per share
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 00:22:46'] I'm a Honda and Toyota fan. Recently rented a Toyota Highlander and its a decade or more behind Tesla. All the legacy automakers are in different areas. Most of them are 10 years behind in tech, but a few aren't. However, even those are still a decade behind in getting to the car costs and volume of Tesla. &#x200B;I don't know how that translates to the stock price, but these legacy automakers are very slow and have a lot of internal politics.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 06:48:35'] Tesla is being priced as a growthy tech stock now, but I don’t see why they wouldn’t revert to trading like a regular automaker once the innovation cocaine wears off.Price cuts and potential for losing EV tax credits in the future could whittle down margins.Elon is absolutely central to their inflated valuation. He’s great, but don’t discount management risk as nonexistent. A long term bet on Tesla is a long term bet on Elon’s mental stability.Look at Ford’s multiples. Are you confident enough in sustained growth and Tesla’s ability to maintain their current advantage/positioning long-term? Are you confident that it outweighs the risk of massive multiple contraction (plus other risks)?Too much downside potential for me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 00:58:42'] Tesla is a very interesting stock. It’s the biggest EV maker in the world. I bought and sold Tesla. Tesla will continue to be the largest EV manufacturer for the next few years at least but its operating margins are starting to diminish because of competition. Another big challenge for Tesla is that its giga Shanghai factory is facing stronger competition from Chinese EV makers the like of Nio , Li and xpev. Tesla is able to export good number of cars from Shanghai factory to Europe and the U.S. but the Chinese trend is going to make it harder for Tesla. Already Nio is expanding globally and have penetrated Norway market and is about to enter Germany. I still expect Tesla to be strong but slowly its dominance will shrink. This may mean its stock is not as attractive as it was, like 1-2 years ago. I am little bearish but could be wrong

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:04:05'] The bear case for Tesla is, that when Apple announces thier car in a few years, apple willDo what apple does best.   They’ll take over the EV market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 08:50:18'] bullish: they outperform all legacy carmakers (jap/koreans/eu/us) in EVs by wide margin and there is no way for them to match tesla in any waybearish: tesla is losing to BYD and other chinese also bearish: market seems to price in the first point, but not the second
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 10:27:21'] The bear case is that there are a 6 or more car companies that make great products at cheaper prices. For example my fam is shopping for a compact suv. 34k or less is the price target and i can find great cars from honda, subaru, kia, hyundai, mazda, etc.  Good luck competing in that world.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:40:30'] its too hard to guess how much tesla can make per car sale.  A slight increase or decrease in price can affect how much money they make.Take toyota for example.  I think one of the quarter last year toyota is only making 1000$ per car.  If you think about it, all toyota need to do is sell all their car 1000 dollar more expensive and they can double their profit.The trend in the car industry is everyone just boycutt each other so much until there are no profit.  So its kind of a lousy business to be in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 21:11:50'] GM was the first mover - they were producing the Volt before Tesla released their own design/factory-produced Model S  (the Tesla Roadsters were hand assembled, using Lotus car bodies).  GM squandered that lead.For your questions:- who is selling an EV with more features/quality/less recalls/better Consumer Report customer survey scores?- who is selling more EVs?- who is making more margins on EVs?- who has a full-self driving system in customer cars today that has more features than the FSD beta?(answer: no one)

It’s now 2023, I still have the car, it’s in the self driving “Beta,” and it is laughably incapable of managing mundane driving complications.

More valuable than all the other auto manufacturers in the world, including the ones that sell more cars and make more profit. We've reached the point where those competitors have matched or passed their tech. Mercedes is the first to sell a car internationally certified for level 3 self driving and is building a billion dollar EV charging network. Even Subaru has matched Tesla at Level 2 with their EyeSight system, already in use in over a million cars. Basically every major manufacturer has promised to deliver Level 3 or higher in the next few years.With Tesla following instead of leading at this point, and missing deadlines by years being commonplace, I really do think their perceived value will start to drop.

But this can apply to any company, of course the route was pre determined. They’re filming a promotion video they know where the car will go, how long it’ll take to get there, and will have everything in place to film it and make it look the best they can.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 18:39:07'] Wow that is a striking issue. It amazes me that Elon isn't under indictment for stock manipulation. His entire net worth has come from skyrocketing stock, mostly Tesla. And mostly due to their public demonstrations and videos of the technology, such as self driving. This is pretty striking that it is this bad. On top of the liability with deaths and what not, this could also be interpreted as defrauding investors, and shareholders. Much the same way Theranos did with their technology.

I'm surprised there isn't more pushback from customers who bought it because of FSD claims.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 15:33:33'] Tesla deserves this. I can't believe how stupid and irresponsible their marketing team was. When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being "self-driving" or having an "autopilot" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) "autopilot" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is "operating on autopilot" means that they're distracted).Even if the engineers had wanted to call it an "autopilot" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi I'm a noob at investing and I was wondering about Tesla's stock price. Their stock has grown rapidly the last 4 years to as high as $407.36 a share and recently dropped as low as $108 and now it's back to $198. It is the biggest or close to the biggest electric vehicle company in the world and easily the biggest in the US controlling a large share of an expanding market and they seem to do well in most quarterly earnings reports. That alone would seem to give them a pretty good valuation. \n\nBut is their value inflated even at its current price? What do experienced investors think. Thanks"
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:32:16'] Tesla has a current PE of 55.99, a forward PE of 49.47, and a PEG of 4.62 so by those metrics it is expensive compared to other companies in the S&P 500.

You'll have to decide if Tesla is worth its PE, but make sure to look under the surface and not just at share price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:17:44'] The issue with buying a company with such a high growth evaluation, specifically a car company, is that at anytime the market sees that growth as no longer sustainable you will immediately get a haircut (new P/E ratio). Tesla does have the benefit of being a pioneer in the EV space and has done a great job of building a brand that is recognized. But, as time goes on the EV space is going to become more competitive. Granted buying Tesla could be profitable, but you are going to have to deal with a great amount of volatility if you become a shareholder.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 02:24:16'] It's over-valued but what else we can see right now in this? We can just understand that it's over-valued but still that doesn't mean we can't invest and do well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:38:05'] Over inflated to the true book value and multiples like P/E etc.  Until Detroit can catch up with their eVs it still has an edge. To speculate it will move from 197 to 300 quickly can be misleading. I see choppy obstacles all along. To think this trend will sustain forever one really needs to realize oversea models will be introduced give it less an appeal.The stock is good for speculation.  It is not another futuristic apple stock in eVs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:03:00'] Lol you all have come from underneath your rocks since it hit $103. Good to see you all again lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:53:16'] >But is their value inflated even at its current price? It depends on whether you're looking at the current price or long-term speculation as to the valuation of Tesla and the future of the company. Right now, you could make the argument that *all* tech and growth stocks are overinflated given current econimic conditions. You could say the same of the market in general with the  on-and-off bull market pushes and resistance from retail investors. The market in general has been at odds with economic data, inflation, lackluster earnings, etc. That being said, if you're looking at long-term value, there's substantial data, information and positive outlook for Tesla's growth that would support it being a much higher value in the future.Personally, I've owned Tesla stock and traded options on it since 2016. It can be a little volatile at times and overly-reactive to news, but there's a reason its one of the most popular stocks out there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:01:17'] I love all the tesla hate in here. It’s my second largest position and I was adding heavily under $130 (people thought it was over valued then too). Personally I don’t really care what other investors do but 55 PE for TSLA with current growth rates is not a bad deal. A good amount of the people in here are probably salty they didn’t get it on the massive sell off and will decide to buy once it hits all time highs again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:51:01'] Generally speaking reddit as a whole is out of touch with reality. The hivemind here is wrong on just about every issue. So if they say it is overpriced, it's probably fairly priced right now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 17:20:20'] Almost nobody here has any clue about Tesla. It seriously hurt reading all of these comments. Apple was once a lowly computer company and later went on to become the largest company in the world. At the time almost everyone thought the iPhone was a fad and that Apple could never compete with the REAL phone makers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 08:16:12'] Of course it's over-valued but doing the best in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:58:46'] Personally, I like $TSLA. I like the products, I like the vision, I really liked the investing day speech about breaking into the common Joe Shmoe market instead of purely selling luxury vehicles. They have a significant advantage in EV Manufacturing & charging infrastructure due to their experience. Valuation depends on your goals as an investor. Long-term investing it’s a safe bet that Tesla will be successful in the future. Short term were in one of the most difficult periods for auto manufacturing & could be a bumpy road
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 04:35:25'] Never look to Reddit for a good valuation of Tesla. This comments section is fucking oblivious 🤣
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:47:54'] I have a high conviction that if you buy and hold TSLA until 2030 you will beat the market easily. Their battery storage just started on an exponential trend. The way they manufacture is on a different level and they will have basically unlimited demand for their batteries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:07:38'] Yes, no auto manufacturer should be priced like a tech company with unlimited scale. Most stocks are over priced right now. We saw a 30% increase in the total money supply since 2020, and we’ve yet to see the Fed’s rate hikes make a dent. M2 being down 2% YOY isn’t going to cut it. Every bubble we’ve seen burst in the past had a fraction of the liquidity we see today sloshing around, and saw rates increase at a much slower pace. But somehow a lot of folks think stocks are fairly valued? Doesn’t add up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 06:15:00'] Nah I just can't say Tesla is overvalued, it's just some people are not researching enough about the company to find out the reality they should know at the end.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:46:26'] The price forecasts for the future. At the moment it doesn’t seem like there are any significant obstacles in their way to ramp up. No other legacy auto company looks like they will capture the EV demand le Tesla will.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:51:25'] There are lots of ways to value stocks, and a lot of Tesla’s stock price can only be justified as “Speculative value,” meaning they’re paying that much because they think it will be worth even more in the future.Given that legacy car brands are starting to electrify and shift capacity towards more plug-in hybrids and full electric vehicles, and Tesla’s long history of poor build quality and unfulfilled promises, I don’t think that speculative value is justified.Now that Tesla stock is tied to Elon Musk’s ability to run twitter, and twitter is turning into a dumpster fire, there are serious doubts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:56:50'] You will get conflicting answers. It’s on you to do extreme due diligence on the company to then make a decision to invest in the company or not. In my opinion: do not buy any stock unless your investing timeline is 10 years or more. Do your research on the company. Investor day presentation just came out on Wednesday. Start there. Read Twitter. Watch YouTube. My take? This will be one of the biggest companies in history in 10-20 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:19:12'] So sick of hearing about Tesla. I can't wait for the day that growth inevitably slows and the Tesla bulls get rugged. I'm shocked that anyone is still in after the entire c-suite already rugged them this last year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:57:51'] Maybe maybe not. If you feel it’s overvalued then short sell the company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:38:07'] Well it's a growth stock. People expect it to grow. So you can't just look at it's current PE and PS for the whole story. My guess is it will grow but not as much as the bulls think it will. So slightly overvalued. Used to be clearly overvalued but now modestly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:46:03'] Ok time to add more :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:23:10'] I have never owned Tesla. At $100 I could see how the numbers made sense, but I'm not really interested in owning a car company in a rising interest rate environment (yes, I know they do other things too, not just cars).At $200 I just think it's massively overpriced. I don't see how a car company can keep up the growth required to grow into that valuation. There is a huge amount of capital and time involved in building a new factory. To keep exponential growth going, the factory requirements seem crazy to me. I might be wrong, I just put it in the "not for me" category. There's plenty of other great companies out there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:42:22'] I would say fair value is around $70 but I'd be a buyer at $40.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:01:51'] It is, they don't sell nearly as much cars as other companies. But like many will say it is not a car company it is a data company. But even then it still is overvalued

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:32:53'] My thought is that tesla is a good battery company with average cars. So you are betting on whether tesla can produce higher quality cars before legacy car companies can produce better batteries.  My guess is those things will happen around the same time, and tesla stops growing and will be valued about the same as other car companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:07:02'] It’s wildly swingy and the valuation is based on assumptions of nosebleed-high performance. Not to say those assumptions won’t turn out to be true, but… if you’re worried about value when choosing investments, this probably isn’t the stock for you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:48:04'] At $100, I thought it was a good value. Room to improve and different ways to monetize. At $200, nope. It will take 10 years to make $200 value make sense and you could have invested elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:20:24'] Of course it is, BUT will it be worth enough in the future to justify its price today? That is the quandary of investing in growth companies with high PE ratios.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:25:08'] Its hard to say. Its going to be around awhile and is an industry leader in EVs, performs better than the rest of the auto industry. Its reflected in the price though and trades at a huge premium and youd probably be okay going very long and not thinking about it. Personally i do not put much weight into growth predictions far out in the future and focus more on current fundamental metrics. To each their own, your dollar in tsla will not be earning as much as in another company relative to the price you pay. Ive owned tsla before and sold for an okay profit but i wont be going back in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 13:53:37'] Is water wet?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 14:06:23'] The company is legit and its future growth path is obvious. The only issue is that it is priced to perfection and every little negative thing is used as FUD and can generate huge swings in the stock price. It’s also easy clickbait for media and other news sources. The thing that Wall St. seems to ignore is the energy business side of Tesla which could pick up the slack if there are demand issues with the auto side.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 14:15:07'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 14:32:14'] Im going to get roasted by saying this but, whatever. I used Tesla for several months as a day-trade stock. The price swung wildly every day as a result on Musk’s behavior. I actually had a good run of it and finished ahead, I think up $100k? Something like that. But it has steadied since his ongoing Twitter situation because it made people too nervous. I do agree with most here that it is still a bit overvalued. But I have no idea of the stock itself is now going off of fundamentals like it should or will still stay somewhat attached to Musk’s personality.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:46:17'] Really all that needs to happen is Tesla keeps doing what it’s doing, then Elon either sells Titter for profit or he hires a Twitter CEO that keeps him at Tesla full time. Elon buys a ton of stock for a discount and retail follows.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:14:10'] I’m a noobie too. I only have 5 shares, bought a few weeks ago at ~$135. I really wish I had bought a lot more, but now am wondering the same question as you. I’m personally waiting until it drops to $140 or so. I have no idea if this will happen or not. When I look at the stock price history over max time, it looks kinda crazy. There’s no steady, linear growth. It looks like it exponentially grew, then dropped and now is coming back up. Like a bad EKG. Hard to say what the future holds, or what the next “sale price” will be, if there is one coming at all. My own investing strategy (I don’t know what I’m doing!) is to not buy more of the same stock unless it’s below what I paid originally. I’m willing to go a little over on this one because I think it’s a good product, and I’m seeing more and more of the cars on the road. I’m in this for the long haul though. Everything I’m buying now I’m keeping 10-30 years, so I’m assuming/hoping it will be a solid investment by then (?)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:18:23'] absolutely without a doubt. TSLA is probably the most over valued company in the world. Larger than all other legacy auto makers combined. It's also an incredible company that has made history, and is paving the way to the future. Question is, does TSLA deserve the premium? It's hard to argue that it does deserve it but again, hard to argue it's not a top notch name either. It's all about what's next.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:34:14'] They’re 100% overvalued and I have no experience trading. I was having this conversation with a friend who loves Tesla, there was no way the share price was going to stay where it was. For them to be actually be worth $380+ half the worlds population would have to be driving them. Their global market share of EV’s has dropped from 17% in 2019 to 13% this year and its only going to continue to drop as other manufacturers continue their venture into EV.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 03:03:56'] I guess one also has to consider what they’re planning for the future. Sure their cars are their main income at the moment, but they have a lot of irons in the fire. They’re really planning for Robo taxis, then there’s their robot, the ai they use to train their cars FSD, renewables. They also just started converting their fast chargers to be compatible with other manufacturers, which means more income from non-Tesla drivers but at the same time, it’s a good ploy to convert them into Tesla customers. So, as a car manufacturer, they’re doing ok at the moment, but in the future it’s not going to be their main income.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 05:33:48'] I do a detailed breakdown of Tesla's valuation every 6 months. [Here's the latest part.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/) This should give you a better understanding of why Tesla is not as expensive as it might seem.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 05:39:09'] Now that Tesla is established and we have a few years of sales and profits to look at, in addition to all the other analysis points other commenters have made, go back a couple years ago and research analysts estimates for where Tesla stock would be in 2023 and see how they stacked up with its current position.My own research says most of them missed to the high side anywhere from 50 to 100%.   Now look at where analysts are putting the stock price for the next three years or so and see if them missing to the upside again would still be a reasonable potential return. Just another data point and by no means is it a definitive way to determine whether to invest or not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 07:50:55'] Yes. No.Pick
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 08:34:34'] I think so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 08:35:30'] Yes. There is so much positive speculation being circulated about the EV market, look at Rivian. Rivian is a financial mess but people are still trading on positive speculations even though they lost over a billion last year and cannot produce more than a handful of vehicles per year currently. I believe Tesla was a buy at 108 and currently is overvalued but if we get a recession and another dip, it may be worth buying short term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 12:08:05'] IMO, Tesla is becoming a victim of its own success. Model 3s are looking like camerys now. They are everywhere, the design hasn’t changed, and the “cool” factor has eroded. New models from competitors are much more attractive, the cybertruck is an absolute gimmick. Mercedes beat Tesla to level 3 autonomy and Elons robotaxi plan seems like it will never happen. I believe TSLA stock value will (finally) come back to earth after one heck of a moon-run.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:42:01'] 🙄 It's these questions that fuel It's value. You have to ask yourself with everything that they are doing, and all the infrastructure that they own and develop, as well as taking into consideration the position that they are in and the insane demand that they have would you want to bet against them? Tesla gets a lot of haters, it's constantly hated but I will tell you this, I don't think there's been another company that has burned short sellers more than Tesla has. When I look at Tesla I don't see what it's value is I see where the trends are, and at this point why bet against them? You could and just become canon fodder or you could just ride the wave with it. I've made a lot of money with TSLA ignoring the people that say it's overvalued. It makes dynamic moves as a stock so it's not for everyone, but its value is what it is, not what other people think it should be.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:04:46'] I think Tesla has had its day. Every other established car company has an EV out or coming out. Honda owners will go for a Honda and Audi owners will go for an Audi. Tesla was leader of the pack but that pack has caught up and soon Tesla will be just another car company. I know I’m about to get blasted by Tesla owners or investors but start asking people what they will buy for their next car/EV. Tesla has a cult following but that’s it. ICE vehicles aren’t going to be sold by 2035 in many western countries. Many Americans don’t even want to acknowledge they are in a state that’s signed on for 2035. My point being that all car companies will be EV and plenty of car manufacturers have loyal customers. Tesla had some prestige but that time is over. Even Tesla chargers are now no longer only for Tesla but ANY EV. their fast charger is still Tesla only but for how long? As networks grow that propriety will seem more like an asshole move.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:20:28'] If you believe it it’s still mostly a car company (I do) it’s certainly is. If you believe the Elon hype sure go for it. Generally autos are not a good investment.

Then look at ford market cap. Vs Facebook/apple/google. Elon is a master manipulator not only for investors, but market manipulation as well. (Ended up in court for it) He is nothing like the real Tesla. He defiles the name. He’s not one of the greats. He’s a wanna be Tesla. He never invented anything that changed the world. He cares more about mars than people that starve to death.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:33:28'] Yes.  Once Apple finally announces thier car, Tesla will drop big time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 20:50:20'] I’m generally a fan of Munger, but this take is a bit awkward. IIRC when Berkshire bought into BYD, EV cars by BYD were not a thing. They were buying a cellphone battery manufacturer. They made a good bet as it turns out. But to switch the storyline into thinking they’ll do well in cars is far from certain. It’s as if their beloved American Express company shifted over time to be more of an entertainment business than a credit card company and then exclaiming they’ll destroy Disney. Maybe. But also maybe not.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 17:26:59'] Munger needs to look at the data.BYD's pricing is a lot less than Tesla vehicles for their best selling vehicles. They have only started selling premium EV's and they pale in comparison to Tesla sales.Their best selling vehicles are almost half the price of a Tesla Model 3 or Y.As to BYD's profitability, he's including hybrids as well and hybrids are more profitable than EV's currently.I like BYD a lot and own shares, too. They're a great company and clearly know what they are doing. IMO, they are going to be the 2nd largest auto company in the world by 2030. Tesla needs to address the market with a cheaper Tesla variant priced around $22-25k in China if they want to increase vehicle unit sales there. For the United States, they probably won't need that variant for the next few years because the average vehicle selling price in the U.S. is much higher. They don't want to cannibalize their Tesla Model 3 or Y sales by pushing a cheaper variant too early.

It's the same story in other places like the EU (where they're heavily loyal to European automakers) and Japan (where there's barely any American vehicles). Most countries where a major global automaker are headquartered have a very strong "buy local" attitude when it comes to automobiles that helps protect them from foreign competition, it's not like the US where plenty of people will buy cars from European, Korean, and Japanese automakers without a second thought.The fact that Tesla has gained as strong of a foothold in China, Europe, and other countries with strong "buy local" attitudes only shows just how strong of a company that Tesla is that it can overcome that obstacle. GM by contrast abandoned the European market place because it was too hard to compete in as a foreign automaker.

While returns might have been good, all that can change in a few hours based on the decisions of very few people in the CCP or just based on Xi's decision. If he chooses one day to go all in (which is very much a strong possibility) all foreing investments in China from will be worthless. You litterally cant own chinese equity as a foreinger, you purchase notes of promises which shell corporations hold for you.You have no rights as a foreinger, accounting standards are awful, capital controls remove the true information in pricing.I truly thought Mr Munger would think all of this smells of fraud or at least fishy, try and ask Russian investors how their investments has been doing, even if they had some fine returns intially.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 05:42:48'] The only thing BYD is ahead of Tesla in is sales volume in China. However, Tesla makes 8x more profit per vehicle sold and 5x more profit overall. BYD’s volume leadership is accomplished by selling really cheap electric cars that barely turn a profit. In segments where Tesla and BYD compete head to head, Tesla outsells BYD - the Model 3 and Y way outsell the BYD Seal, Han, and Tang in the ¥200-¥300k price range (and this is on BUD’s home turf, it barely exists outside of China and Tesla dominates in US and even Europe). Once Tesla releases a model under ¥200k, BYD might not be the leader in China anymore, and Tesla’s margin advantage and lower prices recently will put pressure on BYD’s profits in the meantime.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/16/tesla-recalls-362758-vehicles-says-full-self-driving-beta-software-may-cause-crashes.html\n\nTesla said Thursday its recalling certain 2016-2023 Model S, Model X, 2017-2023 Model 3, and 2020-2023 Model Y vehicles equipped with Full Self-Driving Beta (FSD Beta) software or pending installation. The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.\n\nThe FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution, according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nThe FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately to changes in posted speed limits, the notice said.\n\nThe group of affected vehicles included the following'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:50:30'] People have the wrong take on this.  It's not the cost of an OTA software update that is the problem for Tesla.  It's the fact that this opens up a big liability for personal injury lawsuits.Tesla has been selling this feature for quite a while, and it's wholly unproven.  If you think defective airbags are a giant problem, wait til the lawsuits start for FSD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:08:59'] Posted in the daily thread too but all the real info is in the NHTSA report:[https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V085-3451.PDF](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V085-3451.PDF)My hot take: Sounds like there isn't any immediate danger to Tesla or FSD but NHTSA is now taking a stance that instructing drivers to remain vigilant isn't always sufficient to make the software safe. They might not be satisfied that the OTA update actually solves all of the problems they've identified. And this is connected with the ongoing investigation, so they may come up with additional demands.These are the specific issues listed in the report:>1) traveling or turning through certain intersections during a stale yellow traffic light;Sounds like FSD could be easily updated to be more conservative in its timing of yellow lights.>2) the perceived duration of the vehicle’s static position at certain intersections with a stop sign, particularly when the intersection is clear of any other road users;Based on the phrasing it sounds like FSD just needs to be more conservative about rolling stops. But if it turns out NHTSA is concerned that FSD on rare occasion still [runs through stops entirely](https://youtu.be/2mYe-629e1o?t=1270), it'll be difficult to conclusively resolve this any time soon.>3) adjusting vehicle speed while traveling through certain variable speed zones, based on detected speed limit signage and/or the vehicle's speed offset setting that is adjusted by the driver; andAgain sounds like FSD can just be made a little more conservative with a simple update.>4) negotiating a lane change out of certain turn-only lanes to continue traveling straightThis might also be a more difficult problem to conclusively resolve because FSD sometimes seems to get confused about what type of lane it is even in. I've seen videos with stuff like driving on diagonal white stripes or using bus lanes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:16:44'] OP really went through and systematically cut out every paragraph which mentions this is an over the air software update and that Tesla did this voluntarily lol. I’ve seen more objective journalism from the CCP. Here’s what was left out, which tells the full story:> Tesla is voluntarily recalling 362,758 vehicles equipped with the company’s experimental driver-assistance software […] Tesla will deliver an over-the-air software update to cars to address the issues, the recall notice said.> CEO Elon Musk and Tesla fans have objected to the use of the term “recall” to describe safety defects or issues that can be fixed with a software update delivered over wireless internet. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter, “The word ‘recall’ for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!”> NHTSA and Tesla communications say [FSD] is something much simpler: a “SAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations.”> The safety recall report notes, “the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle.”

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 18:35:29'] Guys this is bad. I know some of y'all are playing this down because it's just an OTA update but y'all are failing to see the broader scope. Tesla has a monthly service to use FSD that they charge $200 a month. This is basically 100% profit for them. This is now gone.FSD is a very expensive add on for the car if you can no longer get it. People will not be buying it. This add on is also the reason why Tesla has the best margins in the industry. FSD beta made it to where Tesla had over 300k testers almost every day making the system better. This is now gone. This also effects how long it will take for a full roll out of FSD. Training AI takes a ton of input and data sets which they have probably lost the majority. The tech is what made people want to buy a Tesla if this isn't restored it's going to effect their sells.

Margin pressure is the biggest threat to the Tesla bull narrative. Tesla has big efficiencies and made timely investments that other competitors don’t have/didn’t make, so higher margins now aren’t pure vapor - there’s a reason for it. But I continue to think those have to trend toward industry norms in the long term, and the present valuation is too rich if that happens.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 14:43:51'] My feelings about Tesla - great innovator (of EVs), however in the long game(10+ years), SP will struggle to reach new highs. German and Japanese car makers have large enough moat to make competitive products. Europeans will always prefer euro cars, and will prefer a BMW made EV to Tesla, same as Asian will prefer a Toyota. Once the  factories of European car makers get setup for large volumes of EVs, there is no stopping. They will ultimately win the numbers game (cars sold), margins will probably be lower than Tesla though.

I thought Id stay in Tesla for a bit longer, but now Im not too sure.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 17:46:05'] You can sell and take a nice, guaranteed profit.You can not sell and it could plunge from $170~ back to your original entry and it may never recover.  It may recover in a month.You could not sell and it could rocket over $200.  You could not sell and it could incrementally rise and fall over 20 years to $190.  There’s no guarantees here and I don’t think many of us will want to tell you what to do.  I sold mine at the end of last week around $170.  I bought in at $112.  I have no regrets but it’s so personal.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 18:24:00'] It doesn't matter what people online tell you to invest in, or when to buy, sell, or hold. It also doesn't matter what they think.The important thing when making an investment is that you have an understanding of the story of the company, its catalysts, its trajectory, and its balance sheet. Only then will you be able to stomach 50% drops in the red and still hold because you understand the true value and potential. You need to understand how the stock price is affected by all of those things, otherwise you will never know when to buy, sell, or hold. If you have a thesis, you will know when to buy or sell. If you don't, you will be filled with anxiety and doubt. It's just gambling.If you don't feel confident in your decisions as an investor, stick to ETFs until you have a deep understanding of a company.Sincerely, Tesla investor since 2015.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 21:28:18'] Yes sell it now. Then buy it back cheaper. If it goes up, don't sell it.More seriously that depends on your view on its longer term prospects and whether it has gone way past fair value. IMHO it is still well under fair value but make up your own mind!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 21:34:39'] Technically it might have a little room to run or range trade for a little while, but I would set a rather wide Stop Limit Sell and if that doesn't trigger, then consider locking in profits with a limit sell of at least 2/3 or so of your shares before the Fed's 'quiet period' and 1M charts end.Look at it this way: room to move to the upside is more limited than room to move to the downside and upside movement is counter-trend (unless we are changing trend, which is unlikely and will require a retest or some form of confirmation...though some horizontal range trading during early February cannot be discounted either).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 23:47:14'] Its going to the moon, no its going to Mars eventually. Every car Tesla makes is profitable. EV is the future. Solar is just going to get more juicy as gas/electricity rates go up. Buy more, Gamble, Win big. If it goes down just keep buying more (dollar cost average) until you are ready to retire or at least close enough to avoid risk. Diversification is fine for older folks and people who are scared of gambling but look at the people who stayed in AAPL the last 10 years. Tesla will be a roller coaster but I feel its products are so so profitable compared to any other automaker with fewer long term liabilities. If you want to get rich, find a winner and stick with it, even double down on it. I know this is not popular advice here and its gambly but too many pull money out of winning stocks and invest it in safe but mediocre alternatives. If you can afford it, TESLA is a fine stock to bet the house on. It went crazy high, came back down and will probably to crazy high again at some point. Just enjoy the ride. So Im telling you to gamble. But look at the future. The cybertruck and freight business will bring huge profits, automated cars and taxis will bring huge profits, ongoing subscriptions will bring huge profits. Tesla is not just building nice cars, its a massive robot factory too. Musk is a genius and if you can afford to gamble, he is about the best bet out there right now (in my biased but humble opinion). Disclosure:  I'm long on TSLA and will be for at least the next 10 years.Some other things to consider: if you sell and this is in a taxable account, make sure you allow for a big tax bill - preferably offset the gains against other losses if you have them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:50:08'] Sell your original stake at least and keep 20-30% in to ride. That way you’ve lost nothing if it drops and you can still ride up more.Honestly, sell today. Don’t let FOMC screw your profits, just in case
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:02:55'] If you don't want to sell now, when would you do it? :)  My strategy is - do you think that the stock will go up? If yes, keep money there. If not, withdraw. Any history is irrelevant.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:08:04'] Sounds like you're just gambling, not investing, so I would just sell and take the win.If you're actually investing, I'm sure you had an idea of what Tesla should be worth in X amount of years. Calculate the annual ROI if that does end up happening, and decide whether that reward is worth the risk of being wrong compared to simply owning the S&P. If yes, then just hold.Do the work, don't rely on random people's advice on the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:17:54'] You should already know based on your strategy and your analysis on the stock. Since you are relying on strangers on reddit i suggest you sell and take the profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:22:57'] I’d sell half
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:22:59'] I think if you're scared of losing money you should just sell because it will hurt if it happens but then you will probably moan after you sell and the stock goes up. My advice would be just do what hurts less, you can never get out at  the perfect time so don't dwell on it after your decision. I see someone suggested selling half and that seems like good advice.Personally I'm holding my Telsa stock for the time being.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:39:39'] I’ve bought and sold Tesla 3x in that span. I’ve made 22.5% on my money. That’s huge. I’m not a financial advisor but if it were me, I would sell now and buy back in around $160. Buy the dips, sell at the peaks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:48:15'] If you don't know, then trim.  Sell half (or maybe 60%, to take your initial purchase out), and let the free money fly.  That way, if it comes back down, you can reinvest your initial and enjoy more free money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:48:17'] I would rather invest more to make it 100 and sell covered calls every week to churn money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:01:42'] Its early in the year. If you sell then its counted as income not capital gains. If you are feeling this uncertain about what to do then its going to be a rough experience.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:04:27'] I wouldn’t call it an investment if you’ve only held it for 2 weeks. Just sell it if you aren’t able to take the risk of losing on a trade.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:52:54'] Set a stop loss and adjust it up if the stock continues to move up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:59:17'] If you hold the stock for less than a year, you will pay higher taxes on the profit. You just want to make sure you factor that in when you figure out your profit. It’s not going to be 30%, due to the costs (taxes, transaction fees).
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:15:29'] I've always been told to recapture your initial investment and ride the rest out. Personally I bought in pre splits and continue to buy more. I believe with the charging stations contracts alone Tesla will continue to grow and split so do what you're comfortable with. I'm not giving financial advice just recommending you are comfortable with all possible outcomes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:39:12'] You clearly don't have any conviction in Tesla as a company. You should sell. I think Tesla will outperform by a significant margin and a lot of people covering Tesla still believe this is a great time to buy. I think you will be disappointed when Tesla comes out of the next few years as a significantly larger company but you should do your own research.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:45:06'] I personally would sell... But that’s based on my own strategy.. One of the reasons for the spikes was a good round on their recent earnings call which gives it a good boost...

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:56:54'] No don't sell it can go much higher
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:02:19'] If you are a swing trader, following several indicators, really showed "over bought" on the 30th of January. That's when I sold. But that was also decided because the price went up so fast, I felt there may be some pressure of a short term correction. Incidentally, I got into Tesla December 16th because those same indicators all showed over sold. There's about an 80% accuracy of reversal or continuation of trend. I'm my case, yes, it did continue down, I was down about 20% which was killing me, but my son kept encouraging me and I did have ultimate faith in my charts. I sold yesterday morning. I was watching pre market for a big dump and it didn't so I held until open and after considering I felt good about the 17% overall gain, (and I'm a swing trader) and the price was dropping. There's no emotion, I hit sell. You are only down 6% from there but it's your call and it should be based on your investment style. I have no doubt TSLA will be higher. But the ups and downs take time, that run was a quick gift that I wouldn't expect to continue.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:20:14'] historically tesla 10-100xs so selling for 30% is peanuts.  &#x200B;the SPy only does like 8-10% in a year so tesla does far better which is why its the best stock to hold for gains

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:02:46'] If you see the trend, after those rallies, tesla usually goes into an up and down stage where people who made a huge profit sell and people with fomo.keep.buying so the price doesnt move for some time, then it either goes down or it goes up again.Honestly with such a volatile stock, I would just take my 30% gains and leave
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:08:17'] I think they're close to accurately valued now, they were definitely overvalued before but I think a lot of people were exaggerating by how much. Tesla is more than just an auto manufacturer and potential is part of the valuation. But a Musk tweet always has the potential to change this, the Twitter drama has calmed a lot so now may be a good time before it sparks back up again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:20:04'] I like selling enough to cover you initial investment. Let the rest roll. No matter if it goes up or down it’s all profit
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:20:46'] Sell some now and sell the rest later. You don’t have to sell everything at once.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:15:15'] This is not investing. You're trading. I'd sell and take your profits. Congrats
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:15:59'] Sell
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:18:49'] What you need to consider is that although Tesla has had high growth in the past, its P/E is almost 7-8 times more than its competitors, and it is no longer the sole EV maker on the market.I would sell, but I also understand that Tesla has not been the most rational of companies, and it may just go to $250 to thumb it in analysts’ faces. All that to say, you need to decide.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:20:34'] I personally find it’s easier to accept unrealized gains than realized losses

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:53:38'] Your first question needs to be “Why did I buy Tesla shares?” before coming to ask when to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:00:27'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:05:19'] If you're really not sure then I'd sell half and put a stop loss on the rest.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:13:49'] Even though it’s down 40% it is still overpriced. That’s just my take.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:18:04'] Wouldn’t call a position an investment if you’re trading out of it in a couple weeks. You’re taking crumbs today instead of 47 loaves of bread a few years from now. Just my opinion but do what you want.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:23:59'] Yes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:35:32'] I would sell, because i learned from my past mistakes. It happend 2 times. The first was a stock, you know the gaming store. Put in thousands of euros, next week was the highest it has ever been. I could sell, the profit was right there, it was a lot. And i mean a LOT. But i was greedy. Stock went down, i saw red for weeks. Took a year to get some profit again and sold right away. It was not much, but that's my own fault for beeing greedy. Lesson learned, i thought, because it happend again. But this time it wasn't a stock. It was a coin, the one with the dog on it. Again, put in thousands. It went up for several weeks, then Mr Musk went on a late night show, i was ready for it, this is the moment it will shoot up 1000%. Up to this point, i could cash out and be happy, but i was greedy. Coin went down HARD. And after a few days of seeing it go down, i just sold. Scared of the red number that will come. Took a small profit instead of a very big one. That was really when it happend. I learned from it. After that, i did not get greedy anymore. Had 2 big gains since then.Tldr: Better safe than sorry. You either have profit or the unknown.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:49:21'] No

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 16:05:52'] It's perhaps the most overvalued stock on the market rn. It's a strong sell from zacks rank. Its quite literally the bitcoin of stocks, its built on emotion fueled by the general public.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 16:33:31'] I'm not sure if anyone has given you this piece of advice before, but here it is.The stock market I what you make it. When everyone first starts they usually say "wow, I can make money just off my phone",  the Beginner's luck can take you up up amd away. But then comes the fall. Knowing or un-knowingly people make the stock market their gambling machine. My advise to you is to make the stock market your learning machine first and then learn to use your knowledge to make money. Without overwhelming you here are a few things you can focus on:1.) Learn why a stock is good for you to trade. Don't just get in because you overheard someone's opinion.2.) Learn some risk management. Risk management is King, and never forget that. Risk management is one of the fundamental building blocks to trading/investing/entrepreneurship that is kept regardless of how much experience you gain.3.) Don't be so worried about strategies. Find one strategy focus on it and then with experience, you'll learn what you like, dislike, and can improve on.Good luck on your journey.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 04:50:01'] Do a little math, if your up 30%, sell half and then calculate a reasonable stop loss on the remaining half so you're guaranteed to not lose money.This way you take some money off the table, still have some shares if the stock continues to run, and some cash on the side (from the profits) to buy back in cheaper if the stock drops and you decide to do so.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 01:23:32'] I’m just annoyed that it took Reddit this many years to realize Elon was an ego maniac. It felt like nearly a decade of everyone on the internet worshipping this guys for reasons I could never understand. Now that he bought twitter, all everyone is saying is, “I’ll never buy one of his cars1!!!1!!!” What honestly changed for everyone to suddenly wake up? I get the feeling that everyone will develop amnesia and forget this whole debacle if Elon manages to salvage Twitter and stabilize his other companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 20:16:49'] Oh, great! Elon Musk is selling off another big chunk of Tesla shares, which is exactly what we all wanted to hear. I'm sure everyone is happy that he's making another huge profit while the rest of us are left holding the bag. But at least he keeps sending out those funny tweets, right?I mean, who needs a successful business when you can have fun on Twitter? I'm sure all the Tesla shareholders are thrilled that Musk's personal Twitter habits are being paid for by their investments. Even if he wasn't being sarcastic, it's another reminder that you can't believe anything Musk says, and you should never use his tweets as investment advice.So, if you still have Tesla shares, just remember that the market can stay crazy longer than you can stay solvent. Don't let Musk's tricks bring you down. Keep your shares and wait it out. He might tweet something that makes the stock go up again. Don't count on it, though.

Biden has put a big squeeze on China with regards to semiconductor restrictions. China is so desperate that people have been caught smuggling chips in fake pregnancy bumps from Taiwan. Biden could easily grant concessions to China in a back room deal that wink and nod includes putting some pressure  on Tesla’s China operations.  This is just a hypothetical. There is an episode of House of Cards where a cocky billionaire becomes a casualty of geopolitical manoeuvres. If you use your power to go after people long enough they might just retaliate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 01:24:51'] To me Tesla is dying. They need to move away from car manufacturing. Stick to battery tech and other stuff. Cars are not going to sustain them. Rightly or wrongly bigger more established car manufacturers have waited and improved on tesla's tech. Made better built, better ranged, better looking, better priced and certainly more reliable vehicles and the once shining star of the electric world is no more. Musk is nutter. Brand is no longer cool. It's all downhill from here. Just IMO

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 23:37:11'] he can sell shares all he wants as long as Tesla is growing and profitable, which they are, and are. it will have a negligible effect. People whining about Elon on twitter and reddit who bought at the top do not hold a majority of Tesla's shares. Elon is under no obligation to hold any more shares than his contract states. This is consistent with the behavior of a CEO who is about to step down and name a new CEO, which, to most legitimate observers, is the right decision for the future of the company. He'll remain in orbit and guide high-level stuff but the hard work has been done, he knows it, and he's off to other things. anyone who is making decisions about whether to hold Tesla based on what Elon says on twitter about how many shares he is or is not planning to sell....is an idiot. The share price will probably rocket back up as soon as he passes the baton, and then fall again. That will be a fun week for all the the people who bought at the top and sold at the bottom. The point is, the ride is over for now. The best strategy for virtually anyone holding Tesla, who isn't up six figures already, is to hold tight through the leadership transition and see what happens. I personally don't hold individual Tesla shares....but if i did, I wouldn't be buying, or selling right now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 00:29:17'] The idea that the value of 3% of the shares of a company, like TSLA, traded today (84.8 million shares) reflects the value of 97% of the rest of the 3.16 Billion shares, share for share equally, is preposterous, which however is what the Wall Street convention of marking everything not traded to the price of what was today traded means by "market cap" ("marking to market" what has not been offered or bid in actuality on the market).  The next 3% traded tomorrow will probably be traded at a lower share price, so logically the actual market price of TSLA may be easily less than half of its market cap, if its shares were actually offered in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:59:09'] how are they losing their dominance... of course there is competition, but they are so far ahead of the curve at this point.  they produce their own batteries and have the resources to keep expanding that business.  they'll be selling equipment to the major manufacturers at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 00:34:30'] The analysis  against Tesla has been going on since the beginning. While GM and Ford have been closing factories for lack of computer chips, Tesla has been racking up record sales every quarter.  In 2022, they sold double the amount of card in 2020.One reason is the technology dominance used in Tesla manufacturing.  The other is they own their own supply chain. About the only thing not owned is the battery.  Chip issues impacted Tesla too, but they rewrote the software for the chips they could get. They also could do this because they didn't outsource their programmers, something just about every car company was doing to save money. Their future EV cars will be built on the gas powered car's manufacturing processes.  I could go on and on. &#x200B;\*Note:  I don't own a Tesla. But I am a programmer for a tech company. I own Tesla stock.

You are aiming for % of total AUTO share because your largest market isn't current EV buyers but getting the guy who wants to purchase an Audi or BMW ICE vehicle.Hyundai IONIQ 6 is a nice vehicle. The problem is it is an unsustainable business model. They are not profitable and sell few units. If the objective was to sell few units and lose money selling a good EV, Hyundai is winning. Chevy Bolt, lol. I love how you use forecasted Chevy Bolt sales for the year versus Tesla current Q1 sales. Why do you not use the forecasted Tesla sales for the year? Instead you want to make it seem close by comparing a quarterly amount versus the yearly amount? FYI, Tesla is expected to do 1.8-1.9 million EV sales for 2023. Chevy Bolt is expected to do 70,000 for 2023. In which way is this close?Tesla is cutting prices because during COVID when everyone had money, they continued to increase the prices of their vehicles. With a looming recession and economic downturn with higher rates, it was unsustainable for Tesla to sell their vehicles at that same price. It's common sense. "Cybertruck isn't out yet."Literally coming out by this year."Model 2 unknown date."  Expected to release within the next year or two considering Tom Zhu has said they expect Giga Monterrey to start operating quicker than Shanghai (which only took \~year to begin manufacturing vehicles.) If they manage to do this, no other auto company will come close and be profitable selling a $25k EV outside of maybe BYD (which doesn't really report EV numbers separately so it's tough to say for sure).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 06:09:04'] EVs are going to become the main type of vehicle world wide.  For Tesla to retain their EV market share, they would have to end up with half the world total auto market.

Tesla's lead and progress is accelerating, there will be no plateau in progress and development for at least annother10 years. Tesla is already massively in front on nearly every metric. No other manufacturer has anything in the way of battery capacity production to meet any substantial goals of production. BYD is producing more EV's but there margins are super slim, once the $25,000 Tesla comes out and Cyber truck and semi's start rolling out it's game over for everyone else. A new Mega factory being built in China to double even triple mega pack production. A new factory in Mexico and another new factory to be announced soon in prolly Malaysia(?) Each new factory being streamlined and honed to perfect production and efficiency.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:06:31'] Anything I’ve seen written about Tesla by an automotive engineer says under the skin the car is miles ahead of any other EV. Most other OEMs are losing tons of money on their EV expansion. Meanwhile Tesla has been minting margins other car manufacturers haven’t seen in decades with an ROE of over 30%. That massive free cash flow is largely being reinvested back into R&D and capex in order to continue to grow faster and stay technologically ahead of everyone else.2021 sales grew 70% and 2022 grew 50%. Looks like estimates are for 25-30% growth this year off an already high base. Add on to this that unlike every other OEM they have almost no advertising or distribution help to achieve these results. So as far as I can see the numbers don’t tell me that Tesla is losing anything. At most you can say they don’t have a 100% monopoly on full size EVs. Full disclosure: I have no investments in TSLA or any other OEM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 07:33:50'] Yes, Tesla will continue to lose market share in an industry that is growing exponentially.  It wasn't long ago that the EV market was a niche market that was dominated by Tesla.  Keep in mind that as other players, including legacy car manufacturers, increase their EV offerings, Tesla's market share will continue to erode.  Would you care to make a bet on who the top EV manufacturer will be in ten years?  I would bet the answer is Tesla, although they will likely produce a minority of EVs by then.  Also, in ten years most new cars will be EVs, so we have gone from TSLA being the only significant player in a tiny market five years ago to TSLA still being the top producer in a market that includes most retail automobiles.Both things can be true, Tesla can lose market share while still growing at a very high rate because the industry is in its infancy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 17:37:04'] >$150 Billion in Margin loansI'd have to do some digging to find the specifics, but just know the actual $ value of the debt is not $150B, the collateral for the loans is worth (or was worth) $150B.  E.g., he previously had a margin facility laid out for his Twitter acquisition.  It had an initial LTV of 20% or $.20 of credit for every $1 of tesla shares pledged.  Similarly, the margin call threshold was at 35% LTV, which isn't as risky as our typical conception of a margin call.&#x200B;TLDR:  No.  The banks that made these loan facilities were generally cognizant of the concentration risk and volatility of Tesla as collateral, the dollar value of the loans is small, and Musk still has significant equity at the margin call threshold(s).

He removed 433 million in salary costs alone for the year by cutting 3700 employees at an average salary of 117000 per year along with many other expenses. This makes Twitter what it always should have been, a very lean, mean company, that is far less reliant on individual advertisers. I think his revenue may be way down along with the overall net worth but I don't think he is in any financial pain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 05:27:57'] It is possible that Elon Musk could potentially lose a significant amount of money if he loses the Tesla options case and is forced to give up a large portion of his Tesla shares, especially if the value of those shares declines significantly. If the value of his Tesla shares falls below the level of his margin loans, he could potentially face a margin call, in which he would be required to sell additional assets or add more cash to his account to meet the margin requirement. If he is unable to meet this requirement, he could potentially lose a significant amount of his wealth.    However, it is important to note that the outcome of the Tesla options case and the performance of Tesla's stock price are both uncertain and subject to many factors. It is not possible to predict with certainty what will happen in either of these situations. Additionally, Elon Musk has a diverse portfolio of assets, including investments in other companies and ventures, which could potentially offset any losses he may incur from the Tesla options case or a decline in the value of his Tesla shares.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 23:15:16'] Honestly, for their stock price this is the right move.  If they want to keep the infinite growth dream alive, they have to continue selling every car they make and they can always paint a picture of increased volume leading to cost savings and new manufacturing techniques.  Their margins mean nothing if the sales growth is crippled.  If the choice was 1) cut margins but stay on track for 40-50% YOY growth or 2) have growth collapse but high margins, this is the right move.  I think the market is going to be unhappy but it might not be as bad you would think.

Tesla has failed on the second one so now they're going for the first.  I may also add that the CEO recent "behavior" has contributed to the declining sales.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 00:43:11'] Wow, that's actually great a deal, I'm tempted to get one, and I had zero desire to get one a few hours ago. As far as the stock, this is not going to be pretty short term. Tesla must have a huge demand problem if they were willing to slash their margins so much.  The days of Tesla being able to charge whatever they want are over. Long term outlook, with this new price I'm confident they can continue to keep growing their deliveries, but without that margin, I sort of doubt the stock can get anywhere close to where it was.

This might lead them to 50% growth on sales, for a short period or fime, but not on profits.

As a car company with great decade old tech? That is now slugging it out in the streets with other car companies. Or as a tech company that is still leading the pack on cutting end tech and design. As a car company it’s worth $50, if you believe more leading edge tech is around the corner it’s worth $150+.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 08:37:08'] The legacy auto-makers will probably also cut prices to their EVs to remain competitive. However, the biggest difference between legacy auto-makers and Tesla is that Tesla doesn't have any ICE model to fall back on to make up the margin.Tesla is being floated by Model 3 and Model Y only. Tesla is basically cutting margin into their entire product offering.

The bull case is that Tesla will be able to maintain huge margins AND make continue to have high growth in sales. It really doesn't make sense that they can have both, though. Finding the right price seems good as they become a more mature company but isn't consistent with the most bullish theses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 02:37:37'] Wait times in EU immediately jumped to 5+ months within hours. People will paint this as a demand issue, but it outside of China it seems Tesla is just passing on the cost cuts from huge material/shipping costs from the last 9 months on to the customer to make sure they keep a big backlog while they continue to double their production every two years. Margins probably won't see a big change from Q2 2022 (stay ~25% gross).Tesla would rather have a few percent lower gross margins (and still make an insane amount of money for an automotive manufacturer) and know for sure that the next 1-2M capacity factory they'll be announcing soon will be able to sell everything it makes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 03:16:29'] Bye bye margin?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 07:09:15'] This was the right move for Tesla and will make things very hard for other car manufacturers that lack the same efficiencies and cost controls that Tesla has.Margins will obviously be affected, but as mentioned by many others, these prices are basically back to 2020 levels.  Perhaps the supply chain is more expensive now, but Tesla has scaled up production since then and made improvements along the various production lines.  I would guess margins will be similar to 2020 but at a much higher volume.There hasn't been a ton of discussion regarding downstream software sales.  Per Tesla, there are around 285K FSD users currently.  People adding FSD now are either paying $15,000 as a one-time fee, or they are paying a $200/month subscription cost.  More cars sold will mean more FSD users, and more FSD users should mean more FSD data and faster FSD improvements.  More FSD improvements will mean more FSD users, and so on.  There is potentially an FSD flywheel that occurs here, and this is a pure profit generator for Tesla.This also probably means Cybertruck pricing may be similar to what was originally suggested when they first announced pricing back in 2019.  They are rightly going to produce the most expensive version first as they ramp up production before moving to the more affordable variants.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 06:53:32'] I honestly think the best thing for Tesla at this point is to get a new CEO, Elon’s brand is a net negative when it used to be a net positive. Real serious institutional investor don’t care about Twitter drama, they want to feel confident that their CEO is focusing on their investment (Tesla)I’ve held Tesla for years in the past, because I loved the tech, but then it became a meme-stock, Elon became obsessed with Twitter politics, & crypto shenanigans. There’s a lot of increasing competition in the EV space. Tesla may have had a head-start but they can loose ground if they don’t maintain focus. Teslas are infamous for manufacturing quality being inconsistent, which is something more and more consumers are becoming aware about as they look to buy their next vehicle. Also recent PR and controversies regarding their self-driving AI is not a good look for Tesla.I will never short Tesla, but I’ve sold for a really good profit, and not looking to buy back in anytime soon.

They are too fanboy to realize how much damage musk has done to the tesla brand. its even more hilarious they think that he will stop tweeting or something if he steps away from twitter.Please sign this petition or contact the board if you think Tesla needs a new ceo[https://ir.tesla.com/contact-us#contact-us](https://ir.tesla.com/contact-us#contact-us)[https://www.change.org/p/remove-elon-musk-as-tesla-ceo](https://www.change.org/p/remove-elon-musk-as-tesla-ceo)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 03:05:46'] I predicted this like a year ago, and I got laughed at on this sub-Reddit. Elon Musk is becoming a liability to Tesla, not everything he touches turns to gold. Just look at the Boring company and the failed projects they’ve had. People are actively considering other brands because of what he says online you don’t want that when you’re making a car purchase decision. He’s becoming too polarizing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 01:13:23'] Don’t forget that Elon has $100B worth of Tesla shares as collateral for his own personal loans!! There is a very real risk that he gets liquidated out of his 25% Tesla position, creating a panic and a BANK RUN on $TSLA stock if fear/contagion set in. Elon’s personal loans will become insolvent between $120-$130/share of TSLAHe has over 60% of his TSLA stake as collateral. It is >2 to 1 margin; with a high risk of margin call in pending macro environment.He had previous collateral loans even before Twitter fiasco. This article is from last month and he had 267 million shares of Tesla as collateral as of March 2022, before the price fell in the last 6 months. He is having to add to his collateral shares more as Tesla falls. (It is about 50% of his Tesla shares up for collateral as of last month; probably even more now with the recent price drop + his net worth dropping from Twitter losing value (not a $44B asset anymore)."VerityData's InsiderScore notes that Musk had 267.6 million shares of Tesla pledged as collateral for personal indebtedness as of Mar. 31. He holds about 19.7% of Tesla's outstanding shares following the latest sale of about 19.5 million shares, a decline from about 22.4% ownership at the end of 2020.Musk still owns 445.6 million Tesla shares and holds exercisable options for 177.3 million more Tesla shares at $23.34, as well as some smaller tranches of options."Tesla stock is down over 50% since the last collateralized loan tally on March 31,2022.https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/11/09/tesla-sinks-on-elon-musk-stock-sales-twitter-distraction.html

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 05:03:38'] To settle y'all agreement, i'm a stock trader and investor for 20+ years. Based on fundamental analysis tesla is overvalued. With the recent events surrounding musk, the real value of tsla stock is showing.

At that point it will become a good investment for the long term.Tesla is not going to stand still and just let everyone catch up. Their investment in battery technology, their investment in manufacturing processes and the fact they don’t depend on a network of dealerships to sell cars for me are fundamental advantages that will play out in the long run.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 08:04:18'] It is widely believed that the valuation of Tesla is a bit lofty to say the least. We will have to wait for the history books to open to see the full picture of what happened in 2020 that made the stock go 10x in a matter of months. If you check the [insider transactions](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA/insiders) or [earnings chart](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA) of the last couple months, it could be argued that we will see a much more realistic valuation of maybe a 20 P/E going forward with a stock price around 80-100. This would still assume a massive amount of growth and turn a blind eye on the giant Capex that lie ahead of Tesla. My guess is, that similar to SpaceX, Musk will not do the CEO anymore and have more of an advisory / tech role. Tesla is saved from existential threat after all and should be able to exist just as successfully without being tied to Musks public persona so closely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 08:43:33'] I like how Elon Musks value to a company is either invaluable or completely not needed based entirely on the agenda the article of the day wants to push.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 09:44:23'] >The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: “Tesla will be great long-term, but   doesn’t control macroeconomic tides.” He later added “I will make sure   Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term,” but didn’t offer   details.I dont understand why Tesla shareholders should benefit from Twitter, and that is one of the problems they invested in Tesla, and while yes Elon is part of that he should not be conflating that he can just use Tesla for his other ventures as he has constantly done.  He said the same thing about Solar city, and that seems to have gone no where.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 09:44:30'] These people need to call out his rhetoric. The tweets he’s making are far worse than just the action of buying twitter and running it his awful way.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 11:03:53'] With over $20B in cash and a debt balance that has decreased by 50% over the past year, Tesla certainly could do a meaningful buyback. Does Musk think this is the right price though?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 13:21:19'] TESLA had 4 EPS the last year, let's say that this year they multiple it by 5 (0.01% chances it happens) then it's PE will be still being around 10 with its current valuation. In other hand I live in uk and you see Teslas everywhere. With its profit margin they can actually do quite a decent increase in revenue but I doubt it they will multiply it by 4 or 5. Probably a good price for Tesla would be around 100$ more than that is too much, with that price you will be already paying for 4 or 5 years of growth. They have a good product and quite decent marketing.Anyways in short them everything is possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 13:10:43'] There is no clear answer. Their share price reflects many years of future profit, not current levels of profit. Problem is, many expect Tesla to lose market once other car makers scale their eV production. So far, no one else has fully scaled. Ford is probably the closest to mass scale and they are doing it for the F150. Otherwise, it will be another year or two before major scale happens for other classes.Tesla bulls will say they have a tech advantage that will keep them going after competition comes. I havent seen it but everyone is entitled to an opinion.But to answer your question, the reason the stock doesnt zoom up on better performance is because its baked in for many years going forward.

Today we have exactly the opposite. Price fall almost 12% because one of the 3 factories will remain closed for 14 days and work the remaining 17 days of the month. I wonder what impact would have to stock if any major car rental company announced that they signed agreement to purchase 50 or 100K cars. Do you think those would be bullish news, or will be buried under the ton of negativity?

POST_TEXT: b">SHANGHAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Tesla [**(TSLA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O) cut electric car prices in China for the second time in less than three months on Friday, stoking expectations for a wider price war for battery-powered vehicles in the world's largest auto market where demand has weakened.  \n>  \n>Tesla also cut prices on its best-selling Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles in Japan, [**South Korea**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/prices-some-tesla-models-cut-south-korea-official-2023-01-06/) and Australia.  \n>  \n>The coordinated price cuts were part of an effort to help stoke demand for Tesla's output at its Shanghai factory, the company's single largest production hub, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan.  \n>  \n>It was also the first major move by the electric vehicle maker since Tesla appointed its lead executive for China and Asia, Tom Zhu, who has been based in Shanghai, to [**oversee global output and deliveries.**](https://www.r"

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 04:40:14'] Is today the day that TSLA drops back below $100?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 02:17:59'] Tesla makes 9.2k on average from their cars. The discount for the Model 3 in China alone is around 6k, and even higher for their higher end models.Given that most of their money was made in China anyway, that is a 65% margin decline on the Chinese market right here. So Tesla needs to grow 200% in China just to keep earnings even.According to Troy Teslike on Twitter (who is a Tesla bull), the backlog has gone down hugely. My prediction last year was that Tesla would stop growing in H1 2023, with margins declining starting in Q2 2023. I am still sticking to that. The share price correction can get really ugly here if that comes true.Edit: corrected decline
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:07:12'] Will be extremely interesting to see what happens to their margins in Q4 and Q1. They have a ton of headwinds and tailwinds in terms of margins recently, almost impossible to predict what will happen.Tailwinds:* Bigger economies of scale* Negative margins from Berlin/Texas flipping positive* Material costs coming back down to 2019 levels* FSD NA-wide release one-time deferred revenue recognition* FSD NA-wide release probable increase in adoption and definite increase in immediate recognition on new FSD sales* Increasing numbers of MIC sales outside of China (more profitable than sales inside China, especially after price cuts)* Inventory decrease in EU/NA* Larger share of production coming from more efficient factories* Continuous cost cutting on manufacturing techniques* IRA incentives on ~50% of NA sold units (not technically going to Tesla, but may increase demand and allow price increases)* IRA incentives on battery production (may not go into effect until Q2 though)* Model S/X being sold outside of NA again* No more SBC from CEO compensation planHeadwinds:* 60K units in transit at end of quarter, expected to grow even further for 1-3 more quarters (unlike legacy OEMs, Tesla doesn't recognize a sale until delivery)* Discounts during last two weeks of December worldwide* Price cuts in China in October and January* Declining regulatory credits* Soon to be announced new factory investments* COVID issues in China factory in December* Chinese New Year shutdown in China factory in February* Potentially looming recession and high interest rates may slow demand globallyProbably forgot a few, but it's nearly impossible to say anything worthwhile about what the ultimate effect will be. If I had to guess, I'd expect margins to come down a bit during Q4 and even more during Q1 down to, and then start trending upwards again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:59:16'] They just cut prices for the second time in 3 months in China for a total 18% price cut. Chinese made Model 3 now costs equivalent of $33.5k and Model Y the equivalent of $38.9k. At these low prices, it will sell like hotcakesInteresting to note that the prices in China 2.5% lower for Model 3 and 5.8% lower for Model Y than July 2021, so this seems to be at least partially a normalization after a rapid increase in prices.

While they aren't in production just yet, their recent acquisitions and battery tech goals are ambitious and exciting if you're long.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 17:50:42'] There is only Tesla and perhaps some Chinese manufacturers. Rivian if you’re brave enough to wait 10 years until they’re profitable.Legacy manufacturers will suffer and burn as their margins get obliterated and their debt become unmanageable.Good news is Tesla is undervalued with a forward P/E under 25 and they’re growing faster than all legacy manufacturers combined. Perfect time to buy, it won’t get much cheaper even in a recession scenario.Edit: Check out r/Tesla_Charts (new sub) for some actual data on 2020-2022 sales and Q3 earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 18:28:47'] I'ma get some hate but Toyota has it right.The US electrical grid cannot handle a total change over to electric and wouldn't/won't be able to unless we started with trillions in infrastructure and even 5th gen nuclear now.Plugin electrics are your best bet.  They do not need to have 300-500 mile ranges, 95% + of all driving in the US has a round trip distance of under 100 miles.   An ICE with a 100 mile plug in battery is the way to go.  The result is all the torque advantages of an BEV and all of the redundancy of ICE.   Electric prices are going to spike up, gas will spike up as well and potentially even more.   The best value proposition for the masses will be a plug in electric, as it will allow you to trickle charge at home and if you forget or electricity gets to expensive to offer a cost advantage use gas or use gas on longer trips.  Long trips outside a few coastal corridors with a BEV are not possible.plug in electrical with ~ 100 mile electric only range, is what will drive the masses.   Now if you want a premium vehicle a lucid sounds nice a 80k basic package f150, sure.   But battery prices are volatile as hell.  If you want to invest in car manufacturers wait forever for a lucid to become profitable, take the Toyota gamble that they pull off the mass consumption niche or ... Get directly into the resources and battery manufacturers, get smart and get in early Alla enphase
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 17:51:24'] VW. By 2030 the plan is for 55% of sales to be the ev market. They have some really cool electric cars/buggys or the bus coming out called the buzz. Not boring and made with plastic like Tesla. They are heavily investing in this transition and they have the money to do it. The factory in Chattanooga, TN is getting upgraded and equipped to handle a bulk of that manufacturing. Some of the cars will probably still come from a mix or Puebla and Germany but the TN factory will definitely handle a lot. Surprised how often VW is overlooked

They started production 2 weeks ago . There balance sheet shows almost a billion in cash which is good . They have a solid company building there cars in Magna and they happen to own 6.8% of Fisker so added incentive to get the cars built . Looks like very little risk plus there’s a huge short position that could get squeezed at this price point.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 19:53:39'] Not sure any vehicle stock is worth long term investment but the infrastructure is ripe for investigation. I cashed out my Tesla stock a couple years when I thought it was overvalued (I was wrong) but I put all the profits in to Enphase at $5. It’s now over $300.  I don’t think I’ll ever make a trade like that again in my life but looking for infrastructure/component manufacturer stocks is my entire focus for energy speculation at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 19:54:40'] I find it interesting how a lot of people think the only companies that will make electric cars and the NEW car companies that only do electric (like Tesla, lucid, Rivian) I think a lot of people under estimate the ability that a lot of the current car manufactures have to convert to electric. Not to mention how Toyota, Porsche, GM, Ford, Volkswagen, etc all already have lots of capital in huge manufacturing facilities. I personally think a lot of the popular gas car companies now will still be the top car companies when they all go electric. I just see all these new electric car companies as more competition. There were around 200 car companies in the early 1900s. By the 1930s, there were only 44 car manufactures still in business. I think we will see a similar situation as time goes on.

Now you have the traditional already established manufacturers making EVs and all these new companies making EVs it’s not going to end well.

Not sure if that's still happening but I haven't heard anything else from mainstream news outlets. They have supposedly been road tested with JBHunt and UPS. Although Tesla has also been road tested they probably won't release until the regulations actually goes into effect (if it ever does).NY, GA, SC, and CA all have incentives in place for these vehicles. But earliest requirement is 2024 by CA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 13:20:56'] Always inverse reddit. As much as reddit criticizes financial analysts, it behaves just like they do - it follows the stock price. When a stock is going down reddit is bearish, when it's going up reddit is bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 14:27:29'] I’ve had Tesla for 10 yrs and I’m up 2400% so just shut up, he says with a smile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:43:22'] There are a few reasons for that: sentiment. Tesla is a very controversial and volatile stock. It is used heavily for trading and people easily FOMO in when sentiment is good or sell, when it is bad. Gains make it a fun and "cool" investment, while losses make Elon Musk a horrible CEO. Regardless of if those statements are true or not.Additionally it depends heavily on interest rates. Most cash flows to shareholders are expected to come in the future, so changes in interest rates change the present value of those drastically. Distant earnings are uncertain and predictions on how high they will be can change daily, depending on small pieces of information (market share, current sales, brand loyalty, successes/failures in their investments/research/production/autonomous driving...).Overall a very risky and volatile investment and at least i am not comfortable to say to any degree of certainty what the future cash flows will be and which price might be appropriate for them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 16:11:51'] Always inverse r/stocksI saw that the forum was calling Tesla the most toxic asset to hold way back in January. You can go back and read the comments they're hilarious.That's when I bought more.Doing the opposite of r/stocks never fails. It's like inverse Cramer.

Q4 earnings came in and Tesla killed it again. The smart shorts took their gains and gtfo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 12:39:31'] The hate was hilarious. I swear I saw everyone jumping to hate on tesla / musk even on topics that had nothing to do with it. It was... suspicious, way way too much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 13:43:38'] Amongst the widespread financial hysteria of the past few years that hit everything (Sports cars, Meme stocks, crypto, NFT, used luxury watches, comic books, pokemon cards, etc.) Tesla was the only thing that got caught in the hype that was actually backed by a real company that owns real assets and generates real income. Now that all the other bullshit has mostly unwound itself, people are selling off their useless trinkets and digital nonsense and piling into the only the only "exciting" investment that kinda sorts makes sense.It's true Tesla was still overvalued at $100 a share, so it was still a bad long term investment, and it's an even worse long term investment now. But for people who like trading and look to the stock market for excitement, the long term prospects don't really matter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:37:44'] Everyone who was going to sell, sold. It's called capitulation. Tax loss selling did this to a number of names. Once you run out of sellers, a stock price can go up really quickly when people want to buy it. There was a lot of money on the sidelines to come in, so the stock goes up a lot. It doesn't mean any long term predictions were right or wrong, it's just how short term movements happen on the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 03:38:37'] Why it rallied so much yesterday is also confusing, has it bottomed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 05:17:56'] As margins compress valuation has to come down. Makes sense that the stock has sold off after the earnings report. However, for those longer term investors this should come at no surprise and make you more bullish. Why? Tesla has been following Ford's early 1900s playbook and will continue to do so as they move down the cost curve to capture market share.>The real breakthrough came in 1913 with a proprietary innovation, designed by his production managers: the move from batch production to a continuously moving assembly line. The effect of simplification and scale was to move the price of a Model T down to $550 by 1914, when 248,307 of them were sold. By 1917, the price had fallen even further, to $360, with the result that sales soared to 785,432. In 1920, Ford sold 1.25 million Model T's. Compared to 1909, a price reduction of 63 percent -- to almost a third of the original price of the Model T, which was itself a good fifth cheaper than comparable cars -- had resulted in a sixty-sevenfold increase in the number of cars Ford sold.>Simplifying made the company's cars both easier and cheaper to make. And the price reduction was enormously effective in boosting the whole market as well as Ford's share of it. By 1920, his share had soared to 56 percent, three times larger than that of his nearest rival, General Motors, which was an agglomeration of five different car brands. Ford was by far the most profitable car company in the world, both absolutely -- relative to sales -- and relative to capital employed.>Even Henry Ford himself was surprised by how much demand responded to the lower price. A price reduction to 35-40 percent of the original price boosted sales by more than 700 times. **The fact is, the relationship between price reduction and demand expansion is asymmetrical. If you cut price by half or more, demand rises exponentially -- by tens or hundreds or thousands of times.**Any of this look familiar? Tesla is moving from the continuous assembly line to a [deconstructed process as shown here](https://images.app.goo.gl/Mehurhib5Yhr1Ckf6) which will further reduce the cost and time to manufacture. Yes there will be short term pain but the long term story looks bright

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 06:04:54'] The Brinkman quote is why. Tesla is just a car company, and it’s entering a price war during a turbulent economic period. You don’t want your money invested in a price battle, ever. The other car makers are zeroing in on good or better products, Tesla can’t compete with high end cars, and the low end makers are choking its reach. When everyone saw Elon dumping stock, that should have been all anyone needed.

Cutting prices is not a simple policy because once you cut prices expect your competitors to do the same, or even worse.\nNow Chinese manufacturers are enjoying higher sales.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 03:32:03'] All car companies are now building or at least designing EV’s. Tesla has the lead for sure, but don’t be surprised if another company can leap frog them. That’s why my money is on technology that can be used in all EV’s. A good example is Enovix,  $ENVX  close to production on new silicon - lithium batteries with twice the charge capacity in half the time. They own the patents, it’s totally proprietary. The company is about to open some high speed production lines in Malaysia . First focussing on wearables and phone batteries, but highly likely to move into EV batteries in the future. TJ Rogers of Enphase fame is investing heavily. I think this one is poised to jump. Probably not as big as everyone hopes, but I could see a 2x jump in the next 12 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 03:21:13'] Tesla was a great investment, had a fantastic run and it still has an edge on a lot of the competition.However, car manufacturers are starting to gear up and eat into that market share. It’s like big behemoths starting to pick up speed once they get going it’s trouble for Tesla.Tesla has had a great lead but it’s still facing problems it should have dealt with by now. Build quality has always been problematic and it’s concerning it still is. Other car companies have decades of experience in these areas Tesla lacks and while they’re making up for being behind on EVs compared to Tesla, it seems Tesla isn’t catching up on the other points.I’m not anti Tesla, it may still do very well for years. It’s market cap was massively over inflated and Elon himself hasn’t been helping the company the last year or so.Tesla is one of those decisive companies due to EVs, Elon etc that usually brings out the fan boys or haters. SP might do well but ultimately fundamentals and completion are going to matter on whether the companies thrives or even survives.

Elon Musk is already bored with the company and probably wishes it was an AI startup instead since that's the new 'sexy' thing.What Tesla desperately needs at this point in its lifecycle is a CEO like Tim Cook that can scale up efficiently. Elon Musk is great at pioneering into new arenas and generating hype but he is not good at running a mature business. He is facing a lot of headwinds that he is failing to navigate. The other car manufacturers that have centuries of experience in scaling auto are going to eat his lunch. He can't even focus on Tesla because he's the CEO of like 6 companies.I think the gimmick is up.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla Semi *delivery* event has happened, the first delivery actually happened yesterday to Pepsi. \n\n500 mile range at 82,000 lbs real world test. Right off the factory line, onto the road. There was no aero package added and no weight change, and the truck only stopped once so the driver could use the bathroom. \n\nDuring this real world test, brakes were actually cold at the mandatory brake check on route. Which is in place so drivers that normally would have extremely hot brakes dont end up experiencing brake failures due to high temperatures. This is because the regenerative brake system on the Tesla semi works extremely well, to the point where the brakes are almost not needed. Think of it kind of like an engine brake on a diesel truck, but instead of just slowing down the truck it now also charges the battery. \n\nPrice was not discussed, weight was not discussed. \n\nIts clear that this will operate extremely well on shorter routes with its current range, but will not be as useful o'

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 18:03:11'] We need to know the weight of the Semi. There may be a cost savings in terms of fuel and maintenance but are the savings enough to cover the loss of income from carrying less payload?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 18:24:48'] It’s a standard 81000 tow weight that archive 500 miles. Based on the route they show the trip in California it mostly flat on i5. My guess is Tesla will limited produce these for customer and will attempt to replace all their current delivery Semi into their Semi EV since they also own the mega charge network so it’s a lot of saving for OpEx. I’ll say Tesla semi customers initially will mostly base California then Texas and mega charge network will cover between Giga factory and their various warehouses. I’ll say the Tesla Semi will only viable by driving from one mega charger to the next else it will be a niche that only viable for day transit and not those cross country overnight delivery trip until the mega charger is up. If they somehow supercharge under 1 hour then it’s pretty much a standard trucker life and those current hot truck stop will just put an extra mega charger next to it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 20:09:27'] I've been in logistics for 12 years and currently own a motor carrier company.The biggest problems with Tesla semi is not the price, the battery, the weight or even the miles. The biggest problems are reliability, flexibility and infrastructure.See, trucking ain't Uber - it's heavily regulated, the drivers have electronic logbooks and set hours to work with every day. What happens if the truck gets delayed at the shipper for 4-5 hours (quite common in with food distribution centers), has to shut down for 10hrs (logbooks), has to run AC or heat for those 10hrs and doesn't have enough juice left to get to the closest charge station? I guarantee you that Walmart or Amazon won't invest a single dollar to install charging ports at their warehouses.qqWhat happens if we have a breakdown in the middle of nowhere and the closest Tesla shop is booked for a month ahead? Will Tesla allow regular mechanics work on their trucks or force us to use only thier network like they do with the cars? This is a first year model - all motor carriers know it's gonna be full of issues and the shops will fill up fast, it will probably be the most unreliable unit on the market.There is a niche for such unit - local deliveries for internal company transfer loads (Pepsi to Pepsi or US mail for example) and close to a repair hub. But now that brand new unit costing AT LEAST $125K will have to compete with old trucks the local driver use and can buy under $20k. Most of us in the industry know that Pepsi and Coca Cola and other big corps are ordering those units as a publicity stunt. And all of us can tell you these trucks will be less profitable that the established diesel units at least for 3-5 years in the best case. Still, we are excited about the technology, it's the way forward, but we have much more profitable options right now.Additionally I'd never advertise that I'm using Tesla trucks, cause every freight broker and customer will use this as an excuse to drop their prices. The last thing I want to hear is "I'll drop your rates, because I know you are now saving on fuel". And tens of thousands of companies like mine (smaller and larger) are running the show, not Walmart or Pepsi. Those two have 15000 trucks between them (mostly smaller trucks dor local deliveries). There are 3 million trucks on the road and the OVERWHELMING majority drive for people who think like me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 07:17:52'] There is a place in the market for Tesla Semi. If you own a regional distribution business and a fleet, you’re crazy not to consider it. Long haul trucking—Can it be done? Yes. Will it outperform a diesel on cross country trips? Probably not right now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 08:11:53'] We have a Tesla with 40k miles. Brakes started squealing so I checked them. The brakes look brand freaking new.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 13:01:21'] How is it short?? 8 hours driving, 30 minute break, which brings it back to 80% full. Repeat. The small trade off in time to destination, if there is one, will be made up for by the many many cost benefits. Sure not every single scenario will this be ideal, but what a paradigm shift for the industry! 3x the power, no gears, no cooling brakes, way lower stress and exhaustion from driving, and in a few years you think it won’t go 600 or 700+ miles before charging? I think even old school drivers will come around eventually, once they drive one… just like all the people who mocked EV cars 5+ years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 14:09:55'] Good discussion here. The weight issue makes the truck non sensible for me. It's like the human race is saying it can manufacture itself out of fossil fuel dependency. I won't be alive that much longer so I will never see it but the sheer idea...kind of like going to the moon...has its own sense of beauty and weird idealism
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 11:18:51'] In town like sitting on the 405 in cali E trucks would be great, your not covering likely more than 20-30 miles each way, and the truck doesnt burn that much energy sitting parked in traffic for an hour like a diesel would idling that entire time.  For that I can definitely see the Tesla trucks being useful. Also if they can be charged in a meaningful way in say 30 minutes while trucks are unloaded, and waiting for dock space they can literally run all day long without any worry at all.  Your not going to see these on the ice road truckers show or cruising I-40 across Oklahoma etc, any time soon, and If J.B. thinks they can legislate that, your going to see insane prices everywhere for everything.

I think someone will come along in the next 10 years and make a cheaper version with similar stats and take away Tesla’s business. I think Tesla should first focus on creating high quality electric cars and making decent affordable cars for lower priced models instead of diversifying into semi trucks at this point in time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 05:37:57'] Fuel savings will be diminished as electricity prices skyrocket to meet increased demand……the increased electricity prices will factor into every aspect of production, not just delivery……so fuel costs will go down, but heating and cooling the factories will cost more, lighting, running the machines. These will all be hidden increased expenses that offsets the fuel savings. This will effect consumers as well as increased electricity costs effect their homes heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, entertainment costs as well.    Most new electricity capacity will initially come from tax money from the government to build the infrastructure, new nuclear plants, increased electric lines, charging stations set up across the nation, this is very expensive. Taxes will go up to reflect the increased spending.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 08:50:08'] I really wonder why Tesla didn't start with local delivery truck (UPS to beer delivery truck) sized vehicles. It would show proof of concept for a vehicle that only needs to go from the warehouse to the local delivery location and with it being electric, idling would not be an issue. Until the battery tech improves, the long haul freight still seems a little out of reach due to weight/capacity/distance. But this wouldn't be an issue for the smaller box trucks in urban/suburban environments. Crank out a bunch of fleet vehicles for local deliveries first then once the tech has caught up start transitioning the larger freight vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 08:58:07'] If you could have charging stations at major truck stops where the semi pulls up and one huge battery pack is exchanged for another, then this system could be great.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 09:34:55'] Not saying it's a terrible choice, but why are you inflating the number. Saving 600k to a million? What your source on that. Everything I've read, including article about the event yesterday, stated up to 250k savings, without a reference to charging rates or methodology. Further, how was the test performed? Did it have a load of 80k? So, what the deal with massive exaggeration?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 09:43:25'] Edison motors look like an even better design.  Instead of designing a whole new truck, they've made an all electric drivetrain with regen to fit into almost any semi frame.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nTwitter\'s new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to "save Twitter."\n\nHe made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:07:10'] Seriously with such a large following, Elon could have started his own social media platform without spending 44 billion dollars. And he wouldn’t piss off so many people including Tesla investors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 01:32:28'] He said he had ideas about how to make the company profitable. And so far it's just.... "ok everybody pay money for the same shit" ??? And the company he wanted to buy was  about to go bankrupt?Edit - I did see a summary of his communication to all Twitter employees that he has other ideas. The main ones I saw are: \- Add more video capability similar to Youtube. Pay creators like Youtube \- Add content types like Tiktok. Pay creators \- Make Twitter function basically like paypal - like everyone's twitter account is also a paypal/bank account. and can carry negative balances with applied interest rates (interest paid for positive balances, and interest charged for negative balances)\- generally - look at the reasons people are clicking/going away from Twitter, and if that reason is something we can/should do at Twitter, let's do it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:16:47'] Hypothetically I see a narrow path. He aggressively cuts costs, fixes bot spam, adds some functionality, diversifies revenue, hires a boring CEO in a few months, advertisers resume. It's at least sustainable at that point and he makes a profit if rates ever go back to zero. Elon bought at $54 in Twitter's historical $15-71 range. Expensive but he also bought with inflated TLSA proceeds so it's largely a wash. You could argue he bought Twitter at 2014 prices with +3000% Tesla shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 03:38:29'] What an idiot. It’s turning out these billionaires are about as clever as someone that opens up a franchise or a local business and “make it”, the difference is just being lucky that’s on tech and the power of internet distribution gave them billions. But as them being “smart” or more intelligent somehow? Nope. I’m doubting This guy is even doing anything at Tesla besides being a glorified token ceo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 04:30:09'] He’s screwing over Twitter employees, firing half of them then asking the remaining half to work as close to 24/7 as possible. You think Tesla employees don’t see this??  That’s on top of asking senior Tesla ex-employees to give back stock options. Musk is used to treating people like crap and getting away with it. There will always be whores who would work for Hitler or Satan if the price is right, but they won’t be the very best in their fields.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 03:24:28'] presumable there are vows he hasn't broken?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 05:06:39'] He’s going to sell more TSLA.He is cash-poor and has to service that TWTR debt, and will have a lot more losses after the advertisers have left. His only other option is to get a personal loan guaranteed by TSLA stock, and if it drops more, he will be margin called and he will be forced to sell. Then he can claim that it wasn’t him selling, it was the margin call.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 05:31:10'] A vow isn't legally binding in any way.  So less than worthless
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 05:09:24'] He can promise it all he wants when that margin level gets hit though the banks will sell it for him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 04:22:49'] Has he ever said how much money he has pledged against TSLA?  As the stock continues falling, at some point his lenders are going for a cash call.  That would mean selling more TSLA which would drive down the stock further. Also, letting Twitter go into bankruptcy might sound like an option, but that would hurt his ego, I am sure.  It might also make lenders and investors have second thoughts about whether to trust him with their money.  He has pretty much damaged the TSLA brand with hateful tweets, and insulting the “woke” that might have considered buying a Tesla instead of a lifted gas guzzling pickup truck.  I don’t see them rushing out to buy one next year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 06:48:20'] Dude has to be getting margin called at this point on twitter loans. None of those loans were Twitter collateral, all security based collateral by Elon. Perhaps some were spacex though. He is not done selling, this guy lies like I breath.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 03:22:11'] Well if he said he was going to sell he would need to sell more to make up the same amount,Where if he says he's not going to sell, all his butt hole followers will then praise the man with there butt holes out ready for Elon to shaft them again but this time he wouldn't need to sell so many for the said amount

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:24:32'] One big anti-Tesla circle jerk with little to no DD.Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 05:30:37'] A cow? He never made it a vow. He said he had no more planned sales. That didn’t mean he couldn’t sell if he needed to sue to something unforeseen. He’s given shareholders like 10,000x gains and then like 1500%

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 07:03:15'] I don't get why people say this. Elon said I have no plans to sell Tesla stock. This was before the Twitter purchase forced him to sell. Saying I absolutely will not sell stock in 2023 under no circumstances is a much different statement than "I have no upcoming planned sales of Tesla stock"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 05:06:40'] The problem with your critique is that he did not make a promise. If you are long TSLA then your doomed to anxiety.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 04:18:11'] So tired of this narrative. He hasn't broken this vow before. He said "no further sales planned". That doesn't mean he wouldn't sell Tesla stock ever again, and there's always been significant time between when he said this and the next time he sold.If the waiter asks you if you're done eating and you say yes, that doesn't mean you can never eat again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 10:01:47'] The problem with these quotes is that there is never a link to a video of him saying it, it’s just an article with a quotation of what he said without any context or anything. It’s one thing if it’s a ‘promise’ and it’s another thing if it’s just small talk. People hang on every word the guy mutters as if he’s under oath.It’s probably a true statement that he doesn’t plan on selling any stock in the foreseeable future. But plans can change anytime
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:14:16'] He made no such promise…. Nice try on the headline though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 07:15:23'] He said before he didn’t plan on selling. Then he sold . He didn’t lie or break promises. He just didn’t plan on selling.Too many emotions in tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 11:35:23'] To put it in perspective, if TSLA sells 2.4 million cars at similar margins to today we’re like at a 2023 P/E of 20-25. Even if the margins drop a bit to stimulate demand, it’s still 25-30, which is very cheap for a company growing as fast as Tesla is.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 10:18:57'] I wrote this 1 year ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/market cap was $1.1 trillionI wrote this 2 months ago:https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/it3xpyf/?context=3market cap was $644 billionToday market cap is: $385 billionThe reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. Europe:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above €45Ksource: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/I don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. USA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  At the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  Current market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.  Again this is a lot more palatable than what I wrote 2 months ago ($13 billion/quarter).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 15:39:08'] You failed to even mention 2 important factors:1) The head start Tesla had in this space (mass produced EVs) has evaporated.  The other major players are now all-in on making competitive EVs.  They are just a couple years from taking huge chunks of market share from Tesla.2) Elon went full right wing conspiratorial nutjob on the political spectrum, which pissed off the main group of people that would have purchased Teslas going forward - upper middle class environmentally conscious liberals.  No right wingers obsessed with hunter biden’s laptop or paul pelosi’s gay lover are buying an electric vehicle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:27:58'] For point 1, I think Elon is clearly unhinged, and is not fit to manage a publicly traded company, Tesla would be better off without him. However, he has lied so much, and built a large stock price increase on top of that, that kicking him out would have to make investors rexamine what the company looks like in the future. Then there are two other big issues. First, increased competition from the big boy car markers, and 2nd, everything to do with FSD. There is going to be lawsuits from customers over false advertising, and all it takes is one confirmed disaster where FSD causes an accident and kills someone. I can see how it works in YouTube videos, and how its advertised, there is a big gap between the two, and I think that's a big legal liability.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:44:10'] Imo it’ll be good to probably accumulate in 2023.  However I won’t expect the same insane rate of growth.  I believe those days are gone.  Just a slow steady grind year to year instead of a 500% increase in 5 years.  The insane rate of growth, I don’t think it’ll ever get that back.  I expect less volatility and for its price to move more like a mature company after it finally hits its bottom.  Still has some room to go down imo within the next 12 months.  The people who bought the top around November 2021, I think it’ll take at least several years to break even on those shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 13:40:10'] Find it amusing how some people (like Musk) think that it’s no big deal if the CEO stopped showing up to work.

Either way the biggest losers are the bag holders.

The robot presentation was a disaster, the cyber truck isn't coming, the Semi is being panned by critics for obvious flaws in design and execution. Tesla is struggling with the basics of delivery on new products. They no longer are market leaders in design and innovation, there are companies that do every element of what they do better than them. Over the long term this means they aren't as valuable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:13:04'] Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:48:02'] Reason #1 is pretty silly. Tesla is currently on FSD mode - and daily input from a CEO is highly regarded opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:00:54'] I think your point about the rising increase rates being responsible for the drop in stock price is correct because the entire market is down, not just Tesla. I also think if Elon can just give his mouth a rest for a while then Tesla stock price can rebound. Some of Tesla’s fundamentals haven’t change that much. EVs are the future of motor vehicles. Tesla is best positioned to exploit that future. And those two factors means that it’s stock deserves a premium over the legacy car makers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:34:01'] Reason 3 is hysterical. Fed is at 4.5, aiming for 5.25-5.5 but that’s not the rate the banks will give. Prime goes on top, so yes. When Elon says 6% right now, that will be 7% soon. He’s not talking about what he thinks future rates will be. If you’re still confused, go try to take out a loan right now.He has astronomical debt on a failing / non-revenue generating social media company. Add in the rumour that he’ll get margin called on his debt collateral at these prices and he’s got even more selling pressure.This is not reflected in the share price yet. There’s a loooooooot more blood in the water coming. Even if it’s a tech, solar renewable, or car company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 15:21:35'] Reason #6 Tesla has never spent much money on marketing, with the main advertisement being Musk himself. With Musk delving heavily into partisan (right-wing) politics, many people who are interested in owning EVs (usually decidedly NOT right-wing folks, who are happy with their gas-guzzling SUVs) are heavily incentivized to look at the fast-expanding EV lineup of Tesla's numerous competitors instead.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 17:35:03'] Not sure why this always seems to happen, but overvalued stocks start to crash back to their reasonable valuation and then proceed even lower because it coincides with a major market correction - so you get a double whammy.If the consumers are tapped out next year, sales will get hurt. Q4 might show some cracks. Q1 may be really bad.BTW, we just got a really nice bounce in the SPY back to 410 and now rolling over to 382. What happens to TSLA when the SPY goes to 320?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 17:42:53'] There is a very simple thing Tesla could do that could help right the ship. Adopt Lidar as a ADAS and future fsd component. Microvision is the best in class when it comes to  lidar and adas. There is no reason he can buy Twitter for a ridiculous amount of money, but be unwilling to spend a few billion to partner with MVIS to save lives.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 21:27:45'] The reason TSLA stock price is falling is the same as GME or AMC rising a year ago… simply that there are more sellers than buyers. In this day and age it doesn’t mean the company is doing well or bad. Do you think AMC was suddenly doing 100 times better as a company just because it’s stock price rocketed?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 21:51:57'] More importantly....why did it rise so much and become over valued?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 21:58:08'] You’re reason No.3 makes zero sense when the everything is down. Especially Covid sticks have also crash 80%. TSLA isn’t an outlierTSLA fair value is $120.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 21:59:30'] 5 is the most relevant, then 1, not for the reasons you think, but because his behaviour in dealing with the matter, showed the world his true face. The rest have some impact but not as much as you think.If you think a P/E of 40 is right, sure go ahead and buy, however when other car companies have 5-10, this makes you wonder if its still not overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 23:03:43'] Remember the time when Elon was still an asshole but holding TSLA prints free money and no one complained?  Now that it no longer prints free money, everyone complains.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 00:11:02'] The part where Tesla is fairly valued at 600b got me kinda surprised 😮 I’m grumpy on Tesla because I almost purchased lots of it in 2014 but didn’t. But even besides that 600b sounds crazy. I know how it’s not just a car company, etc. yet that number seem to me a bit of a stretch.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 00:50:29'] Where did you derive this $600b valuation number? From speculation? If so, I think Tesla could reach $3T
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 01:19:00'] Combining all major car brands market cap they do not reach the market cap of TESLA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 01:33:02'] I just was watching car vids and saw one comparing the self-parking of a tesla, audi, bmw and mustang.Teslas self-parking was pretty bad.Tesla took a commanding lead in the sector and has now squandered it. The other auto manufacturers have passed them in some areas and are working hard to close the gap and pass them in the remaining, and they've lost their cachet of being cool thanks to musk running his mouth on twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 02:37:59'] You failed to even touch the personal level.  A CEO is the face of a company, when they look bad, confidence is lost.  Elon has absolutely had a breakdown as he has burned twitter to the ground.  Not only does he appear incompetent in that standpoint, but he also drug his company into a political nightmare.  Tesla is not strong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 02:48:56'] I wonder if Twitter was ever consistently profitable? they had a few quarters or maybe a year-but I don't think they had consistent profits year over year-like normal companies?? Plus with so many companies pulling advertisements off their platforms, it is going to be tougher.&#x200B;I am not a billionaire like Elon-but I don't realize the benefit of pissing off your customers-most TSLA owners are the rich left set. Why go after your own customers?? If he is retired and out of TSLA, he can do what he wants, but go after your own "base". Hubris or maybe just  a midlife crisis???

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 04:47:50'] Tesla was way, way overvalued. That is it. It is getting repriced to something that makes sense.Once that is complete then it will be a fantastic long term investment.Where I live Tesla has quickly become the subdivision car. Talking to owners they simply love the brand. I can't tell you how many had one and purchased a second for the spouse.The cars are loved by not only men but also women.BTW, on the self driving front. Tesla has a one of a kind and next to impossible replicate feedback loop with customers. Where they are not only willing but ethusastic to help with the development of self driving with their data.I believe at some point we will see Tesla pivot and use LiDAR. It was never feasible in the past as was just too expensive. But that is not the case as much any longer and it will only continue to plummet in price.So once they add LiDAR and then with the feedback loop they will be in excellent shape. They will take a hit with their customers becaue of all these ridiculous promises of the past. But that will only be a speeed bump and they will get past it, IMHO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:13:52'] Tesla valued at 190/share?? Tesla is way overvalued compared to other EV and regular auto manufacturers. It has no new innovations coming out to improve itself and the products are cheaply made for the price they sell for. It has a lot more room to fall. Also the increase in EV competition will dilute its value over time.

The critical issue for me, however, was not the insults and bat-shit-crazy antics.  It was the cavalier approach to the Twitter safety and compliance staff, and reductions thereof.   If this is the "genius" approach to safety, I am back in the market for an automobile that is produced with a less "genius" approach.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:13:09'] Yes you can absolutly be wrong because tesla is still, was and will be a car manufaturer and nothing more. Now there is a lot of competition and Tesla should have the same PE as the other car manufacturerersPeople just think to much of what Elon is saying and forget the reality.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 16:20:33'] The biggest factor aside from interest rates is  the realization that FSD is a grift.  Robotaxis would be worth hundreds of billions.  This year we've seen Waymo and Cruise start to commercialize their tech.  Tesla has no answer.  It's obvious now that in a few years autonomous vehicles will be taking market share from Uber, and Tesla will capture none of that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:21:29'] Question for you. Let’s pretend we are still in the October 2021 market environment. How much would Elon’s recent actions - selling and his tweets - have caused the stock to drop? How much of the drop would to blame that on and how much on today’s environment?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 16:05:46'] Yes, all should sell their Tesla stocks.So I can buy it even cheaper.And now without joking,I believe Elon did some mistakes.But it's not something that will break T for the long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 11:06:26'] Even though much of what you say has merit, I think you underestimate how stupid of moves he has made lately.  He didn't just say something controversial, he put his company in the middle of a political war that has very high emotions, and sided with the side who do not like electric vehicles, almost to a violent level.  He also proved he was an inept leader with Twitter.  Unless he steps down, I think Tesla has permanent scars.

(Megapack, dojo, fsd, dollar roof, 4680, variety of car tech, robot)Or best to just conservatively put a zero.And what about internal goal of the company to grow 50% per year, take with a grain of salt?I think stock can go down a lot in recession. But i see more execution long-term on new tech.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:45:04'] I think fsd is an underappreciated risk to the company.People are starting to wakeup to the bamboozle, regulators are taking a closer look at it.Class action lawsuits are spinning up. FSD could really be Tesla's Achilles heel ultimately
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:59:10'] Tesla is in a stage 4 decline, will hit its covid lows. Fundamentals won’t change that. Don’t catch a falling knife folks
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 21:32:28'] This is really good evaluation of the company. I feel like so much of what’s posted about Tesla is so tied to general consensus rather than factual sense. Not that I’m saying anything that the CEO is doing is good, but this gives a wider view on the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:41:06'] Elon does know majority of the Tesla buyers are liberals right?.The redneck/altright pick up driving crowd is not his demographic for Tesla but maybe Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:06:17'] Jesus, why are there so many posts about TSLA lately? I suspect unfortunate bag holders think they can save the stock by pumping it on Reddit. There are over 2500 stocks listed on the Nasdaq alone. No need to obsess over one of them
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:18:55'] Didn't Elon predict potentially an eps of 0 in the next year? Reduced margin, reduced volume in all markets.If that's true is that built as a bear case of this model?You have not speculated on the fallout of brand destruction due to becoming increasingly unhinged on Twitter, and specifically toxic to liberals with money, his primary sales demographic. Let's say 1 in 10, 2 in 10, or 5 in 10 customers are now compelled to choose a competitor; how does this affect Tesla's ability to generate revenue and profit?Your bear case is very mild. If even 2 in 10 customers are turned away and gross margin drops by 50%, this is starting to become a calamity. There is potentially far more risk that this post assumes.There are many anecdotal reports of people embarrassed to drive Tesla's or are no longer interested in buying. The evidence will be in the next 2-3 quarterly reports.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:30:37'] Why invest in a company that is now split by political ideology? Regardless of where YOU stand on the political landscape, it's about the consumers buying the product and if half of them aren't buying it because they don't support extreme right ideology means you split the market in half. IMO, TSLA is the worst investment to have, to be holding, to get into. I rather invest in a company that caters to everyone. Also, the clock is ticking. Manufacturers are catching up to EV. TSLA is no longer the only manufacturer anymore and it's hilarious to think otherwise.In addition to manufacturers catching up, battery power and infrastructure isn't catching up to speed. I highly doubt the EV shift is happening at the designated time frames they desired it to be here at. It'll prolong ICE and make TSLA harder to invest in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:03:27'] good bear case.  I wouldn't buy unless its under $20 a share.  its a car company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:22:20'] I can sum this up much easier: Elon pissed off his leftist base by buying Twitter. Tesla is going down much much more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:53:52'] I cant help but think there are enough funds that are counting on TSLA price not to drop much further.. but I've been wrong before. Add to that the fallout if it did happen to drop another 30-40%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:14:06'] Are my Dec 30th 115 and 110’s sold puts safe?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:45:09'] A good company does not mean it’s a good stock. I think Tesla as a company is executing and the last few years the stock was overbought just like everything else. Look at all mega tech and high PE companies. They are all adjusting their earnings and cutting staff. I think I heard it at the Compound and Friends but they likened Tesla to Cisco from dot com. Cisco was and it still is a profitable company but they never reached their ATH due to a ridiculous high valuation it had during the bubble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:57:02'] The cars are superb (QC issues notwithstanding).The tech is outstanding.Their rapid recharging infrastructure is the literal archetype of an ideal charging network.They've pushed legacy manufacturers into finally developing ground-up EVs.Unfortunately, their CEO is a bellend. I'm glad I sold my model 3 last October. I had to get a van (electric) anyway, but everything Musk has done over the last 3 months has made me ashamed to be associated with the brand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:32:11'] High quality writingGg
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:55:58'] I’m not even going to add on Elon’s recent moves. This breezes over the fact commodities required to produce these cars at a scale of their growth with more competition in their space is going to drastically reduce profit. This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I’m very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn’t levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can’t predict. I think recently you’ve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:14:38'] Nice review! I think you are skipping over increased maintenance cost of their supercharger network and investments needed for regulation changes around production.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:15:00'] Can't speak for valuation since it's quite difficult to value Tesla, in my opinion at least. Great background probably one of the more unbiased ones. Learned some new things, thanks!

My expectation for rev growth would be around 50%, 40%, 40% until 2025

What about the miserable detail quality like panels that break off with a slight pull? Or rubber seals that barely hang on the door frame? You didn't even mention the slew of lawsuits the company is facing such as the self-driving feature plowing into people or the car accelerating wildly!There are a lot of things that Tesla has done, or is doing, that has been positive. Selling directly to consumers is awesome. Disrupting the automative industry that was a slave to fossil fuels and forcing automakers to consider EVs is great.But it's painfully obvious that the stock has been over-valued for years and this market correction was necessary
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:12:15'] Tesla paid for infrastructure and their factories when price for them was at an all time high. In contrast, Toyota acquired and built most of their land and fixed assets for factories after WW2 for literally nothing.Your first mover advantage for self driving is overstated. Tesla has spent the last 3 years developing self driving for cars without LIDAR or even radar. They are now behind Volvo and even Cadillac in this area. They also counted deposits for FSD as revenue without having delivered anything close to what was promised. This revenue should have been counted as unearned revenue, which is actually a liability on the balance sheet. Alot of what Tesla has done from an accounting standpoint is going to bite them in the ass, because it contributed to their stock valuation.Tesla’s moat and competitive advantages are vanishing quickly as legacy auto continues to move slowly but surely to catch up, taking as little risk as possible. There are huge headwinds for Tesla, and the added burden of twitter is coming at a very bad time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:59:56'] So tired of the TSLA bagholders. You guys were wrong, plain and simple. TSLA is a car company that can fall another 50% at least from here if (read: when) we enter a recession. The rest is just copium/hopium. Cut your bags.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:09:52'] Great analysis, very comprehensive and well done. Quick question/note, I assume the below is a typo - should be "cost disadvantage"?>You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost advantage, how do you cut them out of the deal?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:42:57'] Is your model assuming flat discount rate? My guess longterm discount rate will revert to mean. But I guess sustained 10% fed rate is also possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:15:00'] I really like this analysis - and I think you did a decent job to balance bullish and bearish indicators.For me the sweet spot to enter Tesla would have been below 100$ per share as I find it highly volatile and hard to predict where it will go (which is why I stayed clear of it so far - for bad and good depending on time). I’d maybe rethink if it hits 112$ now, or 110$ because of your analysis.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 16:53:38'] The lower tsla gets the better it is to go long
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:56:12'] How do you justify its valuation, trading at $350 billion? Also how do you expect financials to be impacted by a recession, which Elon Musk believes will happen?I am long term (5+ years) bullish on tsla but unsure in the medium term (<3 years).
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 19:50:34'] Nice write up in a land of memes and echo chamber rah rah “investing”
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 20:13:32'] I got in at 48, I got out at 82.  To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.I will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.If I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.As such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.The only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.Even then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 00:38:10'] TSLA is still valued like a tech company despite only having a fancy autopilot. Over promising and under delivering are the two thing Elon Musk does the most regarding the companies he owns. January 2017 he said FSD would happen within 6 months. November 2017 he said a Tesla semi will be on the road in 2019. 2019 he said 1 million robo taxis on the road by 2020. Tesla will remain a car company selling cars, and it will probably not be able to justify its current market cap. There’s too many other choices for EVs and hybrids that people are choosing over Tesla now.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html\n\nPalantirs boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.\n\nHe added, without naming anyone, that this is because people who have nothing to offer want to study AI, but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversarie'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 10:31:21'] A six month pause won’t do any good. The open source community is going to eat the  big companies lunch no matter what they do
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:56:07'] I mean, it was painfully obvious right from the start because they asked to "stop it, at least for six month". That at least for six months part is like very funny and giving away. They weren't ready, they had nothing to offer and they tried to use gullible virtue signaling public to give themselves a fighting chance. They failed. It's important to remember these people never about the public. They would obliterates millions or billions of people if it benefitted them, which they passively doing every day. They don't give a flying fuck about doomsday or any of that bullshit. They are the doomsday. Them and their infinite greed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 07:28:32'] This is what I was thinking during the Nvidia rally. The only thing that actually happened is ChatGPT and it happened in November. It's June now. In the vast majority of cases, pouring years of manual labor and $gigazillions of compute resources into AI will not result in something profitable.Generative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.Palantir dude is right. And Altman, Woz and Musk alike know the government isn't capable of stopping AI just like they're not capable of stopping drugs or FOSS. They're focused squarely on their respective corporate agendas.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 08:11:08'] I mean... if you actually do more than read headlines, you're going to realize this is exactly what people are warning about.It's like nuclear weapons. The other people have it, we have better ones...but eventually they will want more too, so we gotta keep developing stronger nukes. You need to escalate because the "enemy" will..... The whole point is that the race is already here. We're in it. But that's exactly where the danger is. If you look in popular fiction like Terminator you will see a General hook up Skynet to all military systems and cause the apocalypse. You think wow that's really dumb why would you do that... But what if AI managed flight plans save billions of dollars or dozens of lives? What if giving AI access to optimize your data center means you will save billions compared to your competitors? If you don't do it your competitor will.There will always be people who are chasing efficiency and profit wanting to push the boundaries of AI.The only way out of this arms race is to agree together to be careful. It's exactly like the nuclear non proliferation treaties... not that that has fully prevented countries like North Korea from developing more nukes. It will likely be really hard to get the same consensus for AI, since denying a country AI could have serious disadvantages economically.It's a really hard problem. We might be in an unstoppable incentive structure to...well Skynet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:43:13'] What's scary is that he is right. The current war has showcased that with good intels from big data analysis, and 15x artillery launchers, a small country can defend itself.  Right now, RU is doing everything to slow down the Ukrainian expected counter attack, from bombing power plants to destroying dam.  And it looks like the special intels that are being generated with the PLTR platform are very useful since the US spec ops department wanted in as well.  If Ukraine somehow wins this war then it will mean more countries will want the same PLTR platform.  There is already an AI and super computer arm race with China, so that will force the US to continue to fund billions into PLTR because every AI companies are too far behind to catch up.  It is such a weird company.  In theory, it should be valued more since the world western governments will soon be outsourcing PLTR into everything based on this war.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 12:52:21'] AI is absolutely NOT comparable to crypto; these "bubble" parallels make absolutely no sense.AGI, the thing we are afraid of, is at least an order of magnitude out of reach. There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything "live and organic and thinking". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).AI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain "skilled labor positions" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a "regular" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.But if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a "untrained" AI.If I'm McDonalds, AI is very welcome. The big mac is coming out the same every time. If I'm a 3* michelin star restaurant, AI simply has no place.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 04:11:48'] He is unloading. He knows where the price is going. He knows he is over his head in Twitter and that Twitter will become another money pit filled with his grand delusions. So he is salvaging whatever cash he can. Otherwise without it, soon he might become just a "normal" Elon. Which his fragile, rich, spoiled kid ego would not be able to deal with.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 15:10:38'] Interesting that he's selling at this price. The stock is down considerably. I take it he needs funds for Twitter, that sponsor revenue he has to replace and the company is at its debt ceiling.As I see it, he has fucked himself royally with Twitter. Unless 100s of millions of people buy a monthly vanity service.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla is sharing its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America.\n\nTesla said in a blog post Friday that its design and specification files are available for download. The company said it is actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Teslas charging connector as a public standard.\n\nThe charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.\n\nTesla claims that its charging connector and charge port  which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS)  is the most common charging standard in North America. Its a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger statio'

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 16:01:20'] What a joke!Tesla was first to the market and could've dominated charging (infrastructure), but no. Elons hubris and inflated ego meant "his" standard is used by only Tesla, while *all other major brands use the same open standard charger*. Thag type is, ofc, the only one approved by EU and thus the only one you'd get paid to build infrastructure to. Everyone uses it...but Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 17:34:19'] oops. tesla could have been the standard.... but we all know the story. I've never had a problem with ccs. never looked at it and thought "i wish this was a Tesla plug". ccs is good enough. yes it's a bigger plug. but so what? it has higher power handling. there is always a trade off.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 06:59:01'] In Germany we use the Type 2 for up to 22kW which is awesome. Very well thought through design. For up to 300 kW we use the same type 2 but with additional two prongs that get plugged into the same socket. That is called CCS.  Its a little bit like plugging in two USB plugs at the sams time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 10:34:02'] Tesla could have been the standard if they opened their charging network from the start. they didn't, and so we get a worse connector as standard. thanks Elon!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 19:13:06'] Don’t think for a second that the OEM’s would ever consider this. They would rather have your 2nd or 3rd EV to be anything other than a Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 10:03:26'] I mean, literally every EV on the road loses significant range in cold weather. That's chemistry, and has been known for over a decade. Is every manufacturer lying about range? Or do they just advertise the max range of the vehicle in ideal conditions, just like has been done for a century with mpg.

Obviously they are going to put the highest in ideal conditions.The part you leave out on the bottom of the article is>at minus 15 degrees the average EV had only 54% of its rated range, the study found.Which means Tesla's stated range is par for the course.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 11:23:30'] Driving range plunges to 0 if you drive it off a cliff.Driving range cut if half if you only charge it to 50%.Driving range increased if you only let it roll down hills and never use the charge for propulsion.Science is hard and totally doesn’t matter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 10:19:48'] You sensationalized the title. They didn't inform customers that driving range decreases in cold climates...not overall. Every EV suffers from reduced range in cold climates. Only relevancy of this in the news cycle is that it's Tesla and Tesla is in the news for every finger they lift.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 10:39:16'] So ... Normal operation of an EV in adverse conditions?This is well known in the EV community with tests and studies going back years. But since everyone hates Elon now every negative article needs to be given the limelight. Me and the boys all hate Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 10:39:20'] Can we ban this sort of nonsense content? Tesla's cars definitely don't plunge 50% in range in the cold, [they're actually one of the best in cold weather range after Audi.](https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss#:~:text=Research-,Winter%20%26%20Cold%20Weather%20EV%20Range%20Loss%20in%207%2C000%20Cars,differently%2C%20as%20our%20chart%20illustrates.&text=All%20electric%20cars%20experience%20some%20degree%20of%20range%20loss%20in%20cold%20weather.) And all EVs lose battery capacity in cold weather. Should every car maker start explaining physics when they sell a car? Why don't ICE cars have a warning that your range will decrease when you drive fast?

POST_TEXT: b"Seeing as Tesla is dropping as bad news is coming out about Twitter, do you think this is this just a coincidence or do you think Tesla's valuation will be tied to the fate of Twitter? It's still ambiguous how Twitter will function at Musk's helm, but the market is reactionary and could be assuming the worst."
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:16:12'] It’s tied to the CEO and not the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:47:13'] It's tied to Musk
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:49:08'] Twitter is definitely affecting our perception of the CEO's intelligence and it's not good
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:29:17'] Today's action was a VERY bad sign - on a day with QQQ up 1.1%, TSLA down  5.01%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:49:51'] Considering the rate it pulled back, it doesn't seem coincidental.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:51:02'] Tesla is tied to musk reputation.  it built a loyal following for years with PR. but he ruined it over the past several months. and I don't see his twitter tirade making it better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:00:52'] Well it doesn’t help he is bashing the left. It’s not like conservatives are buying his cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:29:21'] Tesla is now a Musk ETF
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 22:33:24'] Elon taking top employees of Tesla for his pet project. It is right that Tesla drops shareholders are mad at the nonsense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:05:24'] Musk is now more bothered about how to get back his $44bn investment that he was forced to do, because of his big mouth. He has no idea about how Twitter works. He was just using twitter to be a twit. Earlier people thought of it as humour. Now it impacts them as being a shareholder. Why should it not affect valuations?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:57:02'] TWITTER isn't a public traded company anymore. What is happening is the global conditions plus general negative sentiments surrounding all things Elon Musk. Unfortunately.So moving forward, there should be less shareholders in TSLA who were associated with TWTR, who are currently selling to disassociate with Elon Musk.  *"Twitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and its shares will no longer trade on public markets as of Nov. 8, according to a securities filing."*
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:55:10'] Every time Musk tweets or takes action the price goes down another 5%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:45:47'] Considering it's tied to Elon Musk, yes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:21:51'] Here's a look at the financing behind the Twitter deal.https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/who-is-financing-elon-musks-44-billion-deal-buy-twitter-2022-10-07/#:~:text=Oct%206%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Elon,maker%20Tesla%20Inc%20(%3CTSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:01:07'] Sad story of me is I own few Tesla stocks. I watch them die day by day. I don't think Tesla stock recover at all because of Elon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:14:36'] He also put up a large portion of his shares in Tesla in order to purchase Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:01:26'] Yes because Twitter loses money and Musk will have to sell shares to subsidize those losses. $8 blue check marks ain’t gunna cut it and advertisers don’t want to deal with him or potentially have their ad placed next to some tweet with the “n” word.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:36:20'] Lol at no one looking at the Twitter deal not realizing dude mortgaged the fuck out of Tesla to pay for the stock.Musk paying a Bil per month in interest and it’s directly tied to Tesla stock price. More he keeps being Elon, more he sells and more the deal blows up in his face.In other words. Yes. Twitter is directly tied to Tesla in waaayyy more ways than one. And fuck I love watching the Titanic sink
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:13:05'] People saw Elon as a genius. They believed in Tesla because they believed in Elon. When they realized he was not quite who they thought well...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:19:19'] Musk being on Twitter tweeting to trigger people does not help TSLA. He also has a lawsuit this week in court over his pay for TSLA. It was also reported that for Twitter to continue to run next year musk would need to sell some TSLA shares to support Twitter turnaround
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:50:40'] In the short term, probably. In the long term, all stocks will trade based on the fundamentals of the company itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 03:25:04'] Tesla won't stabilize until Elon sells Twitter, for about half of what he paid, and gets back to focus on EV and stuff like that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:00:29'] You guys can’t even flip burgers and watch your phone at the same time and are wondering why is it bad for Tesla that the CEO who’s already CEO of multiple big companies just got another huge company
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:17:35'] Yes, in a way. Elon financed nearly 40B of the deal with Tesla stock as collateral. Problem is two fold. As a SEC rule, majority shareholders in any company  can only leverage a certain percentage of their stock as collateral. Musk is now there. The rest was already collateral to support SpaceX, the Boring company, Neuralink etc. So when the value of Twitter decreases which it appears is happening with every Musk tweet, he has to provide more collateral for the deal. The only way he can do that is to either sell one of his other companies (SpaceX etc, which NASA would love because they of am sure don’t like the newfound optics of being tied to someone who is clearly losing his shit), or sell more Tesla stock, which drives down the price of Tesla. Lastly, who does Elon think buys his expensive EVs? It sure as hell ain’t the MAGA contingent who think the earth is flat and spend their weekends coal rolling down main street of nowhere USA. It’s deep pocketed liberals, so when he goes off the deep end and tweets everyone to vote Republican, that shit is going to hurt sales numbers. Tesla majority shareholders have their balls in a Vice right now because of papa Musks Twitter adventures.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:09:26'] It's going to be tied to Musk actions as it always has been.  In the past its been mainly good, now he is going full MAGA mode...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:58:24'] Tesla stock will be a shitshow until the board fires Musk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:11:18'] Overvalued stocks fall once the growth story fails, or the cult of personality fails - for Tesla both are happening at once.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 22:51:43'] Yes. It will drop
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 06:13:50'] Tesla quality is going down the drain while EM is spending time on something utterly useless crap like Twitter. Tesla Model Y is supposed to have a range of 326 miles on full charge. After 6 months of owning one this thing is showing 257 miles with 85% charge. Owned a Chevy Bolt before thus and never saw this kind of mileage drop in 3 years. Never buying another Tesla again. This is a hyped up piece of crap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:37:55'] For potentially the sentiment, not the evaluation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:56:27'] I would say no but technically yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:52:54'] Tesla's stock is tied to the tweets of Musk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:46:41'] Everyone used to have faith in Elon and think he was a genius.As a genius, you probably don’t go and accidentally buy a multi billion dollar company for 30% higher than it’s valuation, with no relevance to your other companies. Then try to get out of the deal for 3 months while trashing the company before realizing you actually signed a contract to purchase it so you can’t back out. Then proceed to alienate advertisers by participating in particularly bad business practices. Then lay off half the company. Then fire the entire board of directors so you have to make every decision yourself.Elon doesn’t have time to run both Tesla and Twitter. It’s one or the other, and right now it’s Twitter. If he abandons Twitter, there are tons of lawsuits that will follow him.He made a really stupid mistake, and the reason Tesla is valuable is because people thought he was a genius. Now we see he’s just a salesman with a little too big of a mouth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:02:24'] Tesla erased all of its gains from the past 17 months as investors continue to sell off the stock in the wake of CEO Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 22:38:15'] Tesla's valuation has been irrational *for longer than you can remain solvent,* unless of course your name is Bill Gates.But it's price is boned, with or without Twitter. With or without Tesla's ultimate survival as a company. The stock price is, has been, and will be for some time to come, boned.Big cult. Don't worry. Elon 'Jim Jones' Musk has Kool-Aid enough for everyone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:19:16'] When you buy a company your buying the management and it’s ability to intelligently allocate capital. Let that sink in. Oh and Tesla is grossly overpriced to begin with. Would touch until it’s close to 75$
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:29:00'] It's more tied to Musk himself and he's turning into a loser
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:40:09'] It’s currently tied to absolutely fucking nothing so maybe
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 08:49:35'] Normally this sub features clever and funny responses, but I'm disappointed in most of you on this one. OP didn't ask anything about Twitter stock, he or she asked if how Elon runs Twitter will affect tsla stock. Yet many are responding like "durrr Wait you mean I can’t short elons private company?! WTF!!! 19 year old Rediit stock trading genius have been lying to me????"That's not even what the person asked. do better r/stocks. I expect better from you
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 02:27:59'] Not at all, IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:23:38'] >Is Tesla's stock valuation going to be tied to the success of Twitter?Why should it? Is it tied to the valuation of SpaceX? Or Neuralink? Or the Boring company? At least for people who invest with their brains and not their gut there shouldn't be any connection.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 00:59:37'] If twitter becomes the next hatefest like truthsocial or parler, who will want to buy a tesla.musk has declared himself a maga supporter. tesla buyers are 90% democrat, the magas are climate change deniers.so yes, tesla will suffer as twitter descends into chaos.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 00:23:51'] People like to hate on Tesla a little too much
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:36:01'] Tesla is worth buying into at these levels if you haven't yet made any investment in it. Tesla will continue to grow massively over the next 5 years so even in the worst case i can atleast see the stock going to $500 within 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:06:41'] Short term probably. But if you’re holding for 10+ years then no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 00:00:10'] I thought the sell off was tied to democrats going after him for telling people to vote republic
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 00:08:52'] As a Tesla investor, I'm not really happy with Musk right now. This whole Twitter debacle is bad for not only his reputation, but also his companies. And I don't mean the stock price, I couldn't care less about that in the short term. What I'm worried about is the growing amount of people actively disliking Musk, including Tesla a result.Musk should keep his mouth shut for a while and focus on improving this Twitter stuff. Just let the storm go by. Right now, he is handing out free ammunition for people to dislike him. I get it's Elon's personality, but he is smarter than this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:49:49'] No
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:17:37'] Musk financed part of the twitter deal with margin lending based on his TSLA shares, so yes. Also, it already has been. Musk sold TSLA shares, he basically sold enough shares to get 22 billion dollars at a cost to his net worth of 100 billion dollars. He then overplayed for twitter by 300%. He now has to increase the value of twitter by 100% twice to make it worth the purchase price, and then triple the value of the company in order to break even. Meanwhile, his vision for twitter relies on increasing the use of racist slurs 500% and people just do not buy ads to run next to that. So that blue check thing, that’ll fix it…
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:50:08'] Tough to say. People have always used Tesla in order to also get a piece of all of what Elon has (Star Link, Space X). With Tesla stock being put up for the deal, I think it only makes sense that the success of one goes in the hand of the other. He used Tesla stock as part of his collateral Also, Tesla makes a good amount of money on selling carbon credits. As more car companies expand into EV they will also see competition
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:00:32'] It's tied because they are losing money hand over fist and when the bills come due where do you think he's going to get the money to pay it off? Tesla stock. And at this rate he's going to need a lot of it at 4 million a day.  If you expect a lot of Tesla stock being needed to be sold you get out now and wait.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:55:27'] Tesla's stock valuation isn't even tied to Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:18:44'] So tired of the nonsense. Retail is not moving the market. Institutional does. Current market is not related in most of the cases to fundamentals of the company. Liquidity is the problem. Expensive money is the problem. Short horizon of institutional traders is the problem. Not the fucking Musk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:18:18'] Everyone here is talking like the stock price is just based on Musk. What about the fundamentals in TSLA? Aren’t they making money? Or are people just assuming TSLA is gonna go down and lose money because of Musk’s actions entirely? I mean it’s possible but it seems a little far-fetched. TSLA is a huge company
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:23:06'] Well Enron I mean Elon did put up a bunch of stock as collateral to finance the purchase.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:49:43'] $8B of TSLA stock was used to pay for TSLA’s CEO to not do his job running TSLA, so probably. Dumb to invest in TSLA before or after this debacle anyway, so let the snake eat it’s own tail.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:32:31'] Tesla will be fine. Having a Tesla is still a symbol of prominence. It could be tied to twitter but everything is down. I believe it will recover just fine.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 22:01:34'] I think people are worried he will sell more tesla stock to fund the massive interest charges on the 44 billion borrowed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:49:47'] that and what he says on that platform. if dude starts spreading hate and acting like the soup nazi of course that's gonna impact his other business when Twitter starts to fail and his attention is diverted and ties get severed
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 02:29:17'] I think musk bit off more than he can chew.  Building a company from small, mid to enterprise is one thing, but maintaining an existing one is another..
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 03:11:44'] Shouldn't be.  Tesla is a separate company.  Also, I don't see a bleak future for Twitter once all the BS wears off.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 03:39:03'] He used Tesla stocks as collateral to finance the Twitter deal - so surely that connects their financial fate if Twitter goes completely down the shitter. I think it’ll be more of a slow and painful death like what we’re seeing with Facebook rn.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:40:42'] Here is the deal. Twitter is a private company.So we don't know if Twitter will be successful. There are no earnings, no investor calls, etc.So we don't know what's going on behind the scenes.  Elon is always in the news because many people hate him just for being him so it gets clicks when people see him 'losing'Which is why this private company is constantly in the media
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:42:11'] Tesla’s own filings state that their stock price is at least tied to some extent by their CEO’s own actions. They acknowledge that he owns stakes in, and sits on the board of other major companies, and that was before he bought Twitter…So yes, to some extent, the Tesla price is tied to Musk’s Twitter arrangements/venting/shit show.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:46:32'] The stock is responding to what Elon is doing and more importantly what he is saying. His political lean to the right and his outspoken comments could impact sales at Tesla. Whenever a company picks a side, they risk alienating a significant percentage of potential customers. Tesla in particular is known for having a fairly left customer base, making his comments to vote Republican even more confusing. It’s almost like he doesn’t know his customers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:04:37'] Tweeter will fall first ...

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:08:19'] They are tied due to people's politics.  Tesla only ever kept growing because of the liberals who were making money saw it as the future to help save the planet - it had nothing to do with the business model.   (There's a tip for you - find the next forward-thinking company that they will gladly invest in that will help save the world)The liberals are angry with Musk (don't take away their propaganda machines without expecting reprisals), and with that comes diverting money away from what is still a world-positive company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:10:01'] It’s tied to how much of a lunatic Elon is becoming.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:37:03'] Both will be shit in the future. Elon can’t ride the wave of demand for ev any longer. Look at major car maker already  have many ev lineup. The competition will get real for tesla real fast.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:37:27'] Didn’t he pull out Tesla developers to work on Twitter? (Or was it spacex) If that’s the case, then it is somewhat tied to each other?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:41:50'] I would be quite annoyed as a TSLA investor with having Elon fire half the staff at Twitter, then borrow talent from Tesla to fill the gaps there.Those employees work for publicly traded TESLA, not privately owned Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:43:33'] Don’t read into it that much, of course it has an effect on sentiment, but the real reason tesla is tanking is because of high monthly expenses from opening gigafactories, lower than expected deliveries, potential recession, and poor PR for Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:54:53'] It's tied to how much time Musk spends on managing Twitter. If he spends a lot of time on it, it means Tesla will be managed by other, competent, people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:55:37'] The long term. Yes.  If Twitter crashes.  He'll have to sell more shares to pay for the debt. With the price falling every day.  Means he'll have to sell alot more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 06:13:02'] The brand is Elon.  Elon has set himself on fire.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 06:37:26'] No one is talking about the significant increase in short positions in Tesla. The stock is currently being manipulated.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 07:26:05'] 100% yes imo.A lot (if not all) of a stock price is going g to be tied to public perception.I can see Elon making such a huge PR disaster happen with Twitter than we get splashback on anything he's involved with. Assuming the only issues are financial means this is much less likely, but it seems he's making a lot of social/cultural waves and that's going to matter a lot more for a social media platform than an auto manufacturer, but because he's so heavily associated with both I can see their fates getting tied together.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 07:35:45'] I’m a small business owner, because of where my business is and the nature of our products I’d generalize about 75% of my customer base is left leaning, if I started pandering to the right publicly I’d probably lose a lot of those customers.  Point being left leaning people are the ev customer base, and Elon is tanking his customer base. Not saying I won’t buy Tesla stock once it loses another 20% lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 11:36:47'] Musk is playing the entertainment game, putting on a bombastic show to drive up traffic at Twitter. It does come at the expense of him looking like an asshole to Tesla investors. Now he’s also becoming a left wing pariah so his American customer base will reject Tesla cars. I think this is calculated, he has more sales in China and there presently aren’t a lot of Republicans who adopt electric cars. So those markets are there for him to expand to. To summarize: Twitter shenanigan is an act, the left thinks teslas are hate crimes on wheels and maybe he’s hoping to get maga to buy electricOr he’s just an asshole
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 11:50:50'] TSLA shares already dropped $125/shr since Day One of Musk's acquisition of Twitter. That's 3.16 billion shares for $395 BILLION in evaporated value. That would bring the purchase price closer to $439B...

Even if they have the potential to become twice as big as one of the world's biggest car manufacturers, the stock is still not worth that much...So I really hope that people will move away from Tesla with seing Musky boy crash and burn Twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 13:06:51'] Tesla’s been overvalued for a long time. It’s because of Elon Musk’s ability to innovate and how far ahead he was ahead of competitors. With his acquisition of Twitter he won’t be occupying as much time to Tesla and that hurts the company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 13:56:43'] Yes. He used Tesla stock as collateral in his deal to buy it. He overpaid and put up at least 10 billion of his stock.

That's why as Twitter gets worse Tesla becomes riskier.They are now correlated.This is ignoring the obvious keyman risk and terrible management on display by the CEO of both companies

The Dojo tiles are designed for their own use case; training their FSD stack. For their purposes, it's better than the NVDA A100 GPUs they've been using, but they aren't planning on selling these. Allegedly, they'll eventually rent computing time to others, but that remains to be seen and probably won't be a huge revenue maker.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 23:39:09'] For me the biggest ones are: public perception of Elon has changed drastically, the legacy automakers have caught up to Tesla's technology extremely fast, and FSD has been progressing far slower than expected.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 04:45:01'] They actually make money now, they didn’t in 2019. Back then they were grossly, wildly, insanely overpriced. Now, they are just wildly overpriced.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 02:53:06'] I have worked in the auto industry for a number of years. Every single automaker buys competitor's cars and breaks them down to study them..Tesla have atrocious build quality that's visible even in the showroom cars. The big players are playing the long game and they have started catching up tesla in the only field it was genuinly ahead, software.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 05:29:09'] They joined the S&P 500.The stock trades fundamentally different now because of it and people seem to overlook this. Plot the stock vs. the S&P index from the time they entered it.  Aside from the recent dip because of the Twitter fiasco and potential cooling of the auto markets in general, it is moving with the index.Large funds are moving this stock now.  Unless they perform way outside expectations, there is no catalyst for these large funds to begin accumulating more stock at a premium to the general return of the index.  And so far Tesla hasn't had any particular quarter where their performance was outsized compared to expectations so no big leaps in price anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 04:05:31'] At least half of this is all Musk's mouth and behavior. 9 billion in profit and he's pulled out nearly 40?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 00:08:24'] This guy keeps saying stupid shit on Twitter. Personally, I think it’s fucking hilarious and love the shitstorms he starts but when it comes to money, shut the fuck up! If I’m running a business, I’m remaining neutral. Left and right both need cars and frankly, the left typically has more money and lives in the areas where Teslas are hot such as big cities. Like OP said, blue collar rednecks aren’t going to buy electric vehicles in their bumfuck towns over their stupid ass coal rolling lifted trucks.Every single left leaning person I know now hates Elon vs a few years ago when they considered him some Robin Hood savior.I still support Elon because I want to see him get to Mars no matter what but he’s fucking with my money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 05:51:58'] Tesla should  never have been valued anywhere close to where it shot up to; the valuation was insane by any rational metric.That being said, they still have a lot going for them. Profit per vehicle sold is super high; their charging network brings in revenue & is (in the US anyways) miles better than anyone else’s - id never consider a long road trip on another EV - & the overall it’s still the best pure EV option you can actually buy in a decent time frame, especially if you want something other than a sedan (they have figured out EV supply chain & production at a scale others haven’t yet). Globally their sales have been very good as well. How they respond & fare to other EV’s catching up on these fronts will be the tale of the tape down the road. In a nutshell, a lot of the recent downtown is just bringing the value of the company back to reality combined with a backlash against Musk himself since many become passionately against him in the Uber polarized America, but the company is far from anywhere close to becoming a corpse currently.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 02:37:12'] > Tesla has a few more factoriesJust a tiny itty bitty difference since 2019 when they had 1 factory, now up to 4 operational. I'm sure it deserves just a single bullet point amongst the 8 that Elon is unhinged, nothing **fundamentally** different. Just, you know, 4 times their production, nothing major. Selling cars in the recession and ramp ups of today at higher margins than 2019, definitely no room to reduce price in case demand falls short.Fundamentally Musk just went off the deep end, unlike 2019 when he had completely sane ideas like removing landing legs from a rocket booster but still planning to land it on some bus sized robot arms attached to the launch tower. Fundamentally, what he's doing with Twitter now is just absolute madness, and that obviously translates to Tesla, fundamentally. ^(Superficially, Tesla only has 3x the revenue compared to 2019, just a small difference.)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:27:43'] Ark probably needed to take profits to cover its losses

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 23:12:53'] I don’t think she’s very good. She may be smart, she may have been lucky. But she’s had a terrible run of late, if she believes technology is going to usher in a new age of huge wealth building then she should switch to buy and hold.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 00:02:29'] This is another clear example how Cathie Wood has terrible decisions. She can’t read the market and most of the time she gives dumb recommendations yet many people follow her as if she genius. She has been saying the market will crash and will be worse than 2008 since last October. She is either paid or simply without a brain.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:25:13'] Lol, she doubled the value of her investment in Nvidia, which is better than 99% of people shitting her and buying at ATH will do.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:17:44'] It's things like this that make me wonder if I should just eat my losses and move on. I knew she had NVDA in ARKK at one point but I didn't see it listed when the stock took off. But that said, from a valuation standpoint, NVDA hasn't made sense in quite sometime, and it still doesn't even with its huge guidance.

POST_TEXT: b'U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500s longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. \n\nThe broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.\n\nMany of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the markets advance Thursday. \n\nThat helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.\n\nTreasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\n\nAnalysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.\n\nSo far, posit'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:44:29'] This recession is most anticipated and predicted recession in history. Business and individuals alike should be and have been preparing. Secondly, when there finally is a recession I don’t believe it last very long because again. Everyone sees it coming so if your not positioned correctly thats on you
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 21:49:25'] Not sure I'm a bear but I'm about 40% cash right now as I liquidate my tech stocks to rebalance into VTI. I don't understand how we can be in a new bull market when y/y quarterly results were worse. Shouldn't income be rising/improving to be in a bull market? Also, interest rates in MMFs are paying more than inflation and have 0 risk. &#x200B;As an engineer I didn't think tech stocks should've taken the crazy beating they endured last year, but I also don't think they should hit ATHs this year when rates are 5+% and income has been flat. Very confusing stuff. Honestly, maybe we fairly or slightly overvalue at the moment. IF in 1-2 quarters we see better company y/y results than ya we'd be in a bull market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:10:16'] So why the Fed pause? If the markets are calm and we just entered a new bull market, there’s no excuse for the Fed not to continue rate hikes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:52:36'] I think some clarification here is needed."mini-bear" or mini-bull markets are pretty meaningless. As investors, the only thing we should care about are long-term, secular bear markets.The period 1973 - 1977 was a long-term secular bearThe period 2000 - 2009 was another, and one of the worst investing periods in US history aside from the 1930s. Not only were stocks complete trash, but dividend yields were at historic lows. There are dozens of stocks that peaked in early 2000 that are still down 40% or more 23 years later (Cisco for instance)The 1970s bear market was bad, but a repeat of that doesn't worry me too muchA repeat of 2000 - 2009 would be ruinous for stock holders --that is a scenario which keeps me up at night

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 22:40:20'] Let me get this straight, Musk liquidating his shares for x amount does not mean the total valuation would drop only by x amount. Total valuation i.e. market cap is only latest price multiplied by amount of shares. If I sell 100 TSLA and it cause the shares to move by 0.1 cent, i am actually causing more losses in terms of valuations, than the actually proceed of the sale.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 22:07:00'] So I ordered a model Y six months ago. It finally arrives. They want 70K for a car that was 50k 2 years ago. It’s plain, nothing fancy. They “DoNT NeGoTIate”, you know, bc their cars are so special. Well I said fuck my $200 I’m not buying the model Y and ignored their pleas to come pick it up. Their text threatened that “it was going to the next buyer” if I didn’t respond by 4pm. I didn’t budge. Then I get a text “if you pick it up in December we will give you $3,750 off”. Well well Tesla, I thought you had another buyer? They’ve been playing games for too long. Self driving coming next month! Prices coming down soon! Meanwhile they delivered a shitty mode Y product with well documented panel gap issues and yet the musk goons kept pumping the stock. Peak crazy was reached during the SPAC boom when literally any EV startup could be valued more than Henry Ford’s company. FUCK THESE GUYS! Love to see them suffer. Get humble and start selling your electric Honda civics at a price the people can pay or die.

Then I considered going in at 400-500 (now 200-250) but wasn’t sure about Musk and future products.Right now being sorry and being happy about my decision regarding Tesla are even.

He created Tesla to make money but there’s the whole save the world perspective. He probably feels he’s moved the earth in correct direction now that EV subsidized and EV clean cars will be market majority soon. I’m saying he’s always been about his personal objectives which seem to be world betterment. I think he’s achieved it. EVs mainstream today, spacex and nasa back on track to explore space, a decentralized social platform that doesn’t hide the truth. Fuck money, he’s in it for the rush

Two quick examples of mine:\n\n1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.\n\n2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:50:33'] TSLA was my immediate thought, but backward.I commute just over an hour each way by car, almost entirely interstate freeway. Buying a Tesla has been a game changer for me. I charge at home, so I never have added stops and don’t spend $800/month on gas anymore. I use the basic autopilot for nearly 2 hours every day. Passing acceleration and driving up hills (I live in the PNW) are cherries on top. I love the car. I also believe the company may be equal to biotech in terms of being absurdly difficult to properly value. There are a number of potential revenue streams (monetizing the app by opening the charging network to other makers, monetizing proprietary charging hardware/hook up, potential ad revenue via app, and a ton of other things), but there’s also the very real chance that none of those things materialize or fail to be meaningful. There are also Elon’s Tweets, which have a massive impact on stock price movement. I love my car, but won’t have direct exposure to the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 09:17:19'] I've been exposed more and more to Apple products in recent years and I am slowly seeing the light. MacBook batteries don't drain, the phones are slick and IOS is slick and the OS equally is slick. It feels like a richer and smoother product compared to windows. There is also native terminal! Its all on face level however. Windows is better, PCs are better, android is better and google is better. But you need a lot of computing knowledge to get there. But overall I can see *why* people buy the products and stay with the products. Tesla has lost all hope from me as a stock holder. All other companies are making EV's , and there is push backs on tesla. Unless they make serious bounds in auto driving there isn't much for Tesla to go. Elon equally name is tainting tesla as a company. He got political and really, even myself, got swept up in his pr campaign when he was first coming around. There is future for tesla for sure. People keep buying them and driving them. But other companies are going to essentially stop teslas growth. Equally, conservatives hate ev's and liberals hate elon...who the hell do you have left?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:49:14'] >I never owned a single Apple productThis is so funny to me, you absolutely think they are overpriced but have never owned one.For phones, the pricing is similar for a similar product. For computers it has always been like that. I have owned Mac's and PC's for 20 years. Mac's always last longer with less issues.The problem is people see a low end PC price and think it compares to a Mac. Look at specs. Mac doesn't make a low end computer.This us vs them for Mac/PC, iPhone/Samsung, XBox/Playstation is so absolutely ridiculous but somehow people believe one is actually better than the other. They are all very comparable.

It’s still the most misunderstood company on the market IMO, and I’m glad it is.There was a time where I considered investing in Apple and Nvidia, but the 2020 breakout for Tesla was just too evident, and the next breakout is even more predictable.This might sound strange but inevitable things are actually inevitable. Look at technological trend and where the demand will be. The recent deal with Ford revealed a lot more than what was in the news headlines.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.statista.com/chart/29002/tesla-market-capitalization/\n\nShockingly, Teslas drop in market capitalization, roughly $800 billion from its peak, is bigger than the combined valuation of pretty much any legacy car manufacturer you could think of. As the following chart shows, the combined market capitalization of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler and PSA), Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Renault is still more than $100 billion shy of Teslas market cap decline.\n\nSo what caused that extraordinary fall of one of the best-performing stocks of 2020 and 2021? Firstly, Tesla was always valued as a high-growth stock, meaning much of its valuation was based on its future potential. As the economic outlook darkened throughout 2022, so did Teslas potential for future growth, especially considering that inflation and high interest rates will eventually affect consumer spending on big-ticket items such as cars.\n\nSecondly, Elon Musks acquisition o'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 16:30:49'] This is quite deceiving as the rest of the auto industry has also fallen significantly. Ford: -50%,GM: -40%,VW: -50%,Toyota: -25%,Hyundai: -35%,Etc.It’s effectively comparing Tesla’s past market cap with legacy auto’s current market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 05:18:15'] This never makes sense to do
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 08:39:57'] Op Sounds about right. Although Elons claim is partially true. Higher interests pull money from stocks into savings but that woundnt take that much of a hit towards Tesla stock imo. And it seems more to do about him not attending the business by being distracted with Twitter and other companies. But mostly the hype to buy Tesla from the wallstreetbets crowd that’s similar to the crypto scams of overhyping a kernel of Truth to get their bags bigger by DuPing folks. With that said, I see many car manufacturers not really investing big on EV or self driving. Maybe VW.  They are, but not as intense as they should be imo. Even the Toyota ceo saying they are pushing better combustion engines. Car companies are sort of investing in it but more like a “just in case”. They look more old big companies that don’t want to change due to the complexity of the companies. I think these car makers are just waiting for the next republican controller government to push any EV related bill or help way past 2030s and get more years out of the status quo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 06:58:06'] Tesla was the trade EVERYBODY was in.  Now with Elon tilting at Twitter windmills and viable higher quality cars coming from companies that don't treat service customers like the Soup Nazi it is correcting and will continue to do so IMO.  I live in S.F. area and it's certainly not scientific but before Twitter I was seeing lots of Teslas with Temp Tags on them, now haven't seen one in weeks.

That is at least 20% mix.Borrowing interest is higher so why Fords, VW are selling but not Tesla ?  The question needs to be answered is when it will be perceived treated as  a car manufacturer?  Time will tell.

Also doesn't help that auto is incredibly cyclical like housing and we're at the end of the expansion cycle. Oh also gas prices have dropped like a rock and so the EV need as well. On another note, does anyone actually buy ev to save gas money or the environment? I feel like everyone buys ev for the acceleration. I quite frankly don't get the infatuation with ev over the last 2 years. Was $100 extra gas a month worth shelling 20k more for an ev?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 04:44:02'] The pump in 2020 on automakers was vapor.  Not including Tesla.  Tesla is its own thing because it is a newer company without UAW connections and without privately owned dealerships.I cannot speak in any sensical objective terms about the company's valuation and I am not a holder aside from a swing trade back in 2020 that made very high profits.What I can say with certainty is that legacy automakers were and are shitcos from an investment standpoint.  None of them exist without governmental support.  They all teeter on insolvency and have for a very long time.  Stellantis is the only one I would consider but there are better bangs for the buck then looking for exposure in welfare companies.  Because that's what they are.

If you’re lucky you’ll find something you have confidence in that’s undervalued and you’ll buy in at a good time. I personally would avoid buying into “the next best thing” attitudes. There’s high upside but like gambling, there’s more losers in that game than lifetime winners.

It is the massive data mining and accuracy that needs to improved.eV has been around and was the dominant vehicle 100+ years ago. Problem was it could not transport far as America was not electrified to provide charge acid batteries. It used Li-ion battery.Quantum computing could make it big.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:25:09'] Sounds salty. Watch it go even higher now
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:54:00'] I mean..... it clearly is
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:28:44'] I’m not saying NVDA is not overpriced. It certainly appears to be. But so is the entire ARK portfolio. Also Tesla aims for $8-10 TRILLION in revenue by 2030… so Tesla is going to 100x their revenue in 7 years. This woman must be high off her ass or something
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:38:25'] What exactly has Cathie Wood accomplished?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:36:23'] Everyone and their grandma was talking about how overpriced NVDA was, and after the rally everyone's shitting on Cathie in particular like they weren't parroting the same shit for months
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:51:18'] Cathie thought it was overpriced at a much lower price as well. She may very well be right this time. But she's not somebody you should listen to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:11:52'] Couldn’t she just pull up a spreadsheet. Make up some bullshit numbers. Plug in 50% growth for 10 years and set a price target of 2000 after buying it and call it a day? That’s how she hit with Tesla, her single successful stock.Valuation only matters to sane people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:34:02'] The time to sell is probably when she buys in
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:14:03'] NVDA may very well be overpriced. But we won't know for sure until we look back a few years from now.If you watch her CNBC interview, one of the reasons she gave was Tesla Dojo. LMAO. Her “research” has little depth and is often misguided. I watch entertainers like Cathie Wood for fun. To understand AI market I follow real experts like Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI), who said and I quote “it turned out that they make a lot more GPUs than TPUs [or specialized chips] so it's cheaper to train on GPUs.” Google has thousands of engineers working on software and hardware around their TPU. If anyone is going to take market share from Nvidia, it will be Google, not Tesla. Cathie is full of shit and talking her own book.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:02:29'] She calls out NVDA for being overpriced, which it probably is, but doesn’t call TSLA overpriced, which it clearly is. This just comes off as sour grapes and trying not to look like a clown for selling too early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:36:52'] I thought valuations didn't matter for companies changing the world and innovation. Weird!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:36'] She isn't wrong about it being over priced, doesn't mean demand won't keep it overpriced.  Didn't she sell her shares 3 months ago?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:13:39'] She not wrong, but that doesnt mean it wont still go higher to insane levels. Just like her favorite tesla. So in that sense, she kinda is wrong😅
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:34:54'] Why is her opinion even discussed given how badly her fund has performed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:54:07'] >Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after looking at the stock price.FTFY
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:33:41'] Counter take: This is the one time she did good by her investors by reducing risk before an earnings. Sure it turned out to be wrong, but removing risk is never something that should be scoffed at or followed up with FOMO. Stocks at highs tend to be at most risk for correction if earnings do anything less than exceed. This is contrary to every other call she has made of keeping a high risk-on portfolio during high interest rate enviroment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:58'] Besides her missed bet she may be right with that one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:10'] First time she makes sense and being responsible with her clients money. Its okay to miss a rally. There will be 1000s of opportunities if AI is really the next revolution
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:57'] I'd short Nvidia but Cathie has not been right in years so I'll just stay out of this...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:36:57'] Not sure if people are just here to shit on Cathie, or if there's people out there that doesn't think this is a sky high price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:11:09'] "Woman who didn't get an invite says she didn't want to go anyway." &#x200B;Sounds like she missed out and is now trying to justify why she missed the boat and saying it wasn't her fault.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:04:25'] Cope
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:13:28'] Sounds like sour grapes to me.  She’s angling to bring the price down and then swoop in to take advantage.  Happens a lot
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:20:40'] I saw a stat on here the other day that really distills how insane it has gotten: after NVDA's earnings were released, their valuation jumped by basically the same amount as AMD's entire market cap... Of fucking course it's overbought!! Read that again people!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:17:01'] just an obvious attempt at restoring her credibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:30:19'] She is not wrong here with the word overpriced but that did not stop Tesla when that stock was overpriced. It still went up until it crashed like bitcoin etc. The power is in the memo or fomo investors. When they all get bored. It's short short short.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:57:35'] Sure. And what's her new Tesla target? is it 2000 unicorns ?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:27:08'] So did I, Im just salty tho.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:34:53'] She doesnt understand that soon there will be no more need for software because it will be learned. Nvidia is definitely overvalued (soon their competition will diminish them) but the future is in hardware. Software unlimited, and it's free now, hardware is expensive, because it s physical
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:37:01'] Good old Cathie, She missed the boat. Of course it is over priced for  her. She is trying to bring it down with this statement so she can buy and then say how under valued it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:05:45'] All she does is buy overpriced growth stocks that have never proven to be a good investment strategy lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:06:48'] Sold at 415. Missed the high point the last time it spiked and don't want to miss out again. Good luck to those invested still

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:06:49'] She’s got no conviction and is letting the rate hikes force her out of positions. She wouldn’t catch as much flack if she would simply hold her ground and only adjust holdings when the thesis changes.Her overall mantra is disruptive innovation. That shit is not going to happen in a matter of months. I can’t count how many times she’s been in and out of tech stocks like Palantir for example. Buy high, sell low is for a amateurs. Not worth the expense fee she’s charging.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 18:24:42'] She made a lot on NVDA and she's still making as some of her funds still hold it. You sell on the way up, not on the way down. The fact she sold early doesn't mean she lost money, she just didn't make more than she could have and that's just hindsight.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:01:12'] Good critical analysis, thank you for sharing. I have some comments you could check out if you want:>The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars.I think if you look at floor space compared to Shanghai capacity is over 1 million at least, even more for Giga Texas. Don't forget that Shanghai was also guided at 250k capacity. This is because ramping takes infinite time and effort+includes risk, so best to say a low number. Especially in slower ramp rate/permit/anything locations like Germany. Feel free to quantify floorspace and ramp rate etc. if you don't believe. I think terminally Berlin 1.5 million, Texas 2 million or more depending what they place in the building.>If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.Capex per vehicle went down each factory generation, feel free to quantify if you don't believe. If they make a cheaper vehicle I expect significant savings in this aspect also, knowing about gigapress.>35% in the next 12 monthsTime will tell, I see the recession. Perhaps they will have big problems. However, there is also upside if factories in Texas/Berlin ramp, margins improve. And if dollar weakens, or china economy strengthens, china profits increase. Furthermore operating leverage increases the more cars they make.You value the new technology at 10% but that's fine since it is risky business valueing it. But I am a fan because of the new tech. I see big potential if some new tech comes through let alone multiple (fsd, dojo chip, Optimus, 4680, energy). For me the stock is an option on the new tech, with limited risk to lose money if they just execute the rest.So overall I would estimate they have 5 million capacity floorspace, unknown tooling, possibly bottleneck by supplier. I value the new tech based on risky/rough projections.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 19:30:37'] Great write up. Tesla is a scary beast and clearly one of, if not, the hardest stock to value. It’s working in a well established industry, that’s now been flipped on its head. It also has so many side projects that could amount to nothing or multi billions of dollars in revenue. It’s value stands on its growth, and it’s pretty clear that could be decaying… but will it? And will it’s energy business pick up the slack when vehicles begin to decline? Such an amazing and interesting company, thanks again for the write up. I look forward to seeing how things play out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 20:32:26'] I think you're missing some critical pieces with the margin section.   Their margin has been abnormally high because due to easy money they have been able to sell mostly very highly upgraded cars.  In a recession people will buy less cars and they will buy cheaper cars.  To maintain their multiple, TSLA is going to have to do 3 things.  1. They must continue increasing production.  Cost of capital just went way up too...2. They must sell all of their increased production.3. They must still make a profit.  The problem is with high rates, a recession and falling home prices, It's going to be very hard to do all 3 of these things.  It was very easy to sell 100k cars when houses in California were appreciating that much a year and people could pull out equity at <3%.  It was also easy to sell 60k EV's when gas was nearing $7.  Realistically TSLA will need to discount to sell all of their production.  They will also need to slow growth to avoid losing money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 00:11:43'] Interesting analysis. I think you are too bullish on the operating margin, once there is competition the market forces will drive tesla towards the ca. 10% which seems to be more or less industry standard. The notion that margins will stay identical between a "no competition" (past 10 years) and  "full competition" (future 10 years) is not viable. Also I am now wondering why Stellantis has such phenomenal numbers?! Holy shit this company is super cheap for super performance?? What am I missing?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:37:21'] Great write up. Really enjoyed reading through this. Do you think the sale projections are still realistic as consumer sentiment drops? Thanks again for the post.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 02:00:07'] I think people should bare in mind that Tesla's are popular because of Elon Musk and their style not their quality.Once more car makers join the market and they are selling cheaper, higher quality electric cars Tesla is going to grow less.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:23:00'] Ford's CEO has stated that EVs require 40% less labor than ICE for production, and you mean to tell me MB is already over 22% profit margin while having twice the revenue of Tesla?So they produce more than twice as many cars, that are enormously more complex, and are only less than 4 points less profitable than a strictly EV company with ridiculously overpriced cars?Holy shit that's so much worse for Tesla than I originally thought. Legacy manufacturers are going to absolutely *destroy* Tesla once they're fully in the market.Edit- good write up though, I disagree with your conclusion but it's well put together.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 13:24:47'] I'm not entirely convinced with the shift to EVs. As much I would like to see it. Among other things the biggest challenge I see is getting the price point at the same level or similar as ICE vehicles. You can make the argument relatively speaking it is higher initial upfront cost but lower ongoing cost. The early adopters have been households that can afford to purchase, however I don't think that will be the case for the majority. Yes there is the argument that prices will come down in the future, will this benefit the manufacturers?.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 15:16:08'] Your numbers are wrong. Net debt is assets minus debt- not a single legacy has a net debt. Most of the debt is from the financial parts of the legacies which will be paid back by the customers plus interest. Almost all of the debt that the legacies have are covered by MARKETABLE assets if you look at their financials. I know for example that gm ALL(includes factories) of their assets minus ALL of their liabilities is $50b positive
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 17:26:52'] I highly doubt the growth in car sales because they have so far proven unable to release and meaningfully update their portfolio. Since 2016, the same 4 cars are on sale. Almost every legacy automaker has designed and launched more EV models than Tesla in the same time frame, with infinitely more configuration options.Demand will dry up for what is already an aging product portfolio. Given the low amounts spent on R&D, I highly doubt Tesla will update their offerings quickly enough.This comes from a former tesla owner who leases a new car every 3 years. I went away to an other brand (still EV) because I didn’t see myself leasing the same model in another colour for another 3 years. I might have, had there been a proper facelift. And driving a competitor’s product now, I really don’t see any way in which tesla is apparently still ‘ahead of competition’. Quite the contrary. FSD is a joke, there is no edge in battery tech, build quality is abysmal. Service? Yeah. This, coupled with Musk’s gigantic efforts to make everyone hate him, wouldn’t have me touch this stock with a 10 foot pole.The most likely long-term outcome for me is that they’re bought by a Chinese conglomerate and continue to produce a few models out of spare parts, like Maserati.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 15:46:53'] My take away here is Tesla is only favorably priced today with extremely optimistic, and unlikely future performance.Good luck to anyone buying at these prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 13:20:07'] if tesla on the other hand only to able maintain 10 percent operational margin and 10 million cars per year, then it is overvalued right now, because that is toyota.there is only 60 to 70 million cars sold per year.  one third is in china and tesla dont have large market share in china.  it also only have 15 percent in europe so I dont know how tesla can sell 20 million car per year when it dont even have large market share right now in two of the most important market.fsd might be the boost needed to boost the operational margin.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:43:28'] Thank you for putting this together. Folks on this subreddit are totally confused thinking that Tesla to legacy auto is an apples to apples comparison and that Tesla should trade at a similar multiple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:51:37'] What the fuck is stelantis? Never heard of those company. How's it making so much money
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 03:08:21'] Excellent analysis thanks for this. An area that I think is often overlooked is the addition of the Semi-truck. This opens a lot of new doors for Tesla and breaks what is possibly the biggest Market - commercial transport. It is still early days and they only have Pepsi signed up as a sort of test case - a pretty good one all things considered.  If they can prove the Semi to be the best ROI versus traditional it’s game over for legacy who pretty much said this was impossible and do not have anything like this ready. I’m not sure what this means margins wise but this will eat into legacies share in this market, which up until now was not considered in any analysis!I am also pretty gobsmacked at the reception to FSD, I was watching the latest update 10.69 (probably) and it’s incredible. I think we are all seriously overlooking the fact that cars are now driving themselves and this is in BETA mode!  Regardless of the accidents and other issues which of course need to be investigated - did anyone actually think there wouldn’t be accidents using tech like this ‘come on man?’  This aside, for the most part they have a product that not only works but is a subscription model and is the first to market adding new streams of income. Lastly remember that all this ramping up in both scale and deliveries was during COVID where supply chains were strained and everything was considered ‘doomsday’.  Yet they still outperformed every other car maker and market expectations. In addition to this they built Giga factories, secured leasing deals with lithium mines and chip makers before interest rates went up.  So they borrowed in a low interest environment - I think this to be key in its future success. This means that OEM’s and EV startups (all but Tesla) will need to ramp up and scale during a harder time to borrow money and a harder time to sell ‘luxury goods’ potentially let alone have comparable products. This is when Tesla will dramatically lower its prices, we are seeing this already with $7500 off before next years incentive. A side note that I think quite funny about Tesla and advertising and a negative for now. Up until now Tesla hasn’t paid for any advertising, but now musk has bought Twitter for 54 billion lol. That’s probably more than all of the legacies ad spend combined and Tesla paid for that :(.  Here’s hoping that it will have been worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 11:16:53'] Yep, this was kind of the consensus for a long time.  Elon had some wild ideas of growth and capability that never really fit reality, and the massive growth required was a bullet point against that fantasy.And also yep, Tesla isn't a bad stock to get back into.  It's just that the market won't be kind to it for a little while with Elon behaving the way he has.  His name is tied to tightly with the brand for him not to cause issues.  The company as a whole though is and has been doing solid.  It's now just a question of how low will it go and when to step back in.However, there is a bigger challenge Tesla faces.  Many other automakers are stepping HARD into the EV market space, and Tesla no longer has the luxury of being pretty much the only EV maker capable of high volume production an non boring cars or no astronomically priced cars.  This luxury of theirs is fleeting, and they will have to transition into a real grind to fight for market share.  There's really no sugar coating this.  Telsa is effectively being forced into mainstream and now has a sea of competition.  They have to get VERY good with their design, manufacturing, marketing, everything to stay not only a leader but also to stay relevant.  If they are lazy or misunderstand what's critically important (for example, key talent) they could lose a huge portion of their market.  I bring up the example because Musk has notoriously inhumanized humans and doesn't exactly value the talent he has.  He doesn't really understand it, and he may lose everything for it.I like EV stuff, but interestingly I've never really cared much about Tesla products.  I think other brands are doing more interesting stuff, making better products.  There are some really nice bits that Telsa is doing, like making these really big chassis castings which helps a ton with manufacturing, but once the big players are in the game, they have all the resources in the world to do the same or better.  Tesla worked up to this stuff over years.  Companies like Ford can do this with a 1 second choice, and all the infrastructure and manpower is already there.  This is the same problem with other EV startups.  Companies like Rivian and Lucid have massive uphill climbs into real relevancy and retention.  All they have is uniqueness and labor talent.  This is where companies like Canoo are interesting in that they are thinking very different about vehicles, and it's in these deviations that you really separate yourself from the big powerhouses in the industry.  Seriously, Canoo might be the first EV I might actually buy specifically because they fundamentally are so different.  But even they are quite a ways off from relevance.But all of this is getting a bit off topic.  The point is Tesla is in a tough spot.  They have a guy that's the face of the brand that's going nuts.  They have car designs that might not survive real competition from major automakers.  And they don't seem to value employees well enough to retain good talent.  They're losing the single advantage they've had for a decade.  The only saving grace is Telsa, the company, is run pretty well, and they've made excellent effort to develop the underlying infrastructure to actually make a million EV cars.  When you're competing against companies with production targets of 15,000, it's no contest.I am curious where the stock will settle to.  I am also curious what the next 5 years will be like for the brand as people and product compete against the big boys.  We'll never again see the massive growth Tesla's stock showed, but I'm curious how it will progress over 5 to 10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 16:31:32'] >  how the hell is Tesla worth so much more than Toyota when Toyota sells 10m cars a year (with Tesla 1.4m for the full 2022)? Easy - Toyota does not sell 10m EVs.  They can't, but if they did, they'd go out of business.BYD is the real competition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 03:58:45'] My perspective on Tesla's share price is who tf knows because anything could happen and it doesn't have to make any logical sense. But one thing I do know is that a lot of people have assumed that Tesla will take a huge share of the future EV market due to their big head start, and that is just looking less and less likely every day. Traditional car manufacturers are catching up quickly with their own EVs, usually with better build quality and service support, and meanwhile it seems like Tesla is kind of just coasting, not releasing any new models or even refreshing existing ones. I mean, the Model S is a decade old at this point, and every other Tesla is basically just the same design in different proportions (some awkward). Also, it's easy to overestimate the impact of Elon Musk becoming a right-wing troll on Twitter, since not every potential Tesla buyer is extremely online, but he definitely hasn't been doing anything recently to convince me he's really some kind of genius visionary and TSLA's future is bright.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 06:16:23'] Thread is completely filled with entirely unhelpful (yet probably accurate) cynicism about analyst's price targets, but it's definitely worth noting that Tesla is now trading 80% below the consensus 1 year price target, when historically it's always been way above the consensus price target. Probably the most oversold stock in the market right now. The forward PEG is extremely cheap.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:09:07'] No automaker has held up better in the face of material headwinds because they have been extremely agile with sourcing and have regionalized manufacturing bases.  Legacy automakers have been significantly impacted while Tesla navigated fairly well.  I still think their valuation and market cap is demented and therefore do not own any, but I am impressed with them exceeding even Toyota for the agility of their engineering teams.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 05:59:46'] It's really not that difficult. Tesla is just making insane amounts of profits.Over the past year, despite massive headwinds in Q2 (2/3rds of their production shut down for weeks due to Shanghai COVID lockdowns), as well as rising material costs and a global chip shortage, they were able to massively increase their sales and margins, and by extension net income from $2.2B to $9.5B TTM, a 332% YoY increase. And all of that while investing in building two factories that are each larger than their first two factories combined at the same time.Now Berlin is proving to be comparable to China in terms of margins despite much higher local wages, and the US government has decided to give Tesla free money for cars and batteries they were already making and selling with huge margins anyways. As a result, expectations from people with proven track records that Tesla will grow earnings another 155% over the next year may even be on the low end, even though that already gives Tesla a PEG of 0.59. ([This video does a good job going through the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaABZbFZ4rs))The only reason why people are surprised about Tesla's stock price is because they're refusing to do the work and actually look at the numbers, instead of only reasoning by analogy looking a single irrelevant metric like unit sales or a PE value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:09:03'] Essentially Tesla is a company still in rapid growth mode.  What this means is that as long as there is still a wait to order a Tesla, their stock will outperform.  If their production is growing year after year and they are still able to sell out, they will do great.If however at some point they can't sell \*ALL\* of those Tesla's running off the line, they start to run into problems and will likely under perform.  So you look at what affects demand for Tesla's.  Two big drivers for demand are gas prices and ability to afford one.  So if the fed hikes put us into a recession it could be quite bad for Tesla's valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:21:02'] The commenters here are reading too much into a stock price holding up the against market for two months. It is holding because institutions are piling up buying every dip but that doesn't mean they won't sell two months later. Irrational prices can last very long and it will last until it doesn't.  TSLA is a cult stock for both wallstreet and retail. Even the stupid NFLX bubble lasted 5 years because wallstreet continued to pump it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:40:29'] It always amazes me the lack of research and understanding people have here. When you go through it all, it becomes obvious. Tesla will no doubt be the most valuable company within the next six years. 1. First off, the people using P/E clearly don't understand the purpose of P/E. You don't use P/E to measure the profitability of a company that isn't quite designed to be as profitable as possible. This same reason is why many of you would have never bought Apple, Amazon, etc., at their early stages and would have made enough $ to retire by now. 2. "BUT THEIR MARKET CAP IS HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHER AUTOMAKERS COMBINED." That's because traditionally, auto companies have never been valued highly in the market. Why? Because it's a low-growth business... the market was saturated with ICE vehicles, no differentiation between products, and a lack of innovation. Hence, people didn't really care for the auto companies in the markets. It was boring and while they made good profit that was being distributed via dividends, people largely stayed away from auto companies. Just look a their historical stock performance... the ATH for Ford was two decades ago. And a lot of you might not realize this but in 2008, GM and Chrysler got hit badly. Why? Because consumer financing with a broken economy meant GM and Chrysler had a pile of debt that consumers couldn't pay off. These auto companies are highly leveraged. A bad economy means they will have piles of vehicles that consumers can't afford to finance again.3. Tesla changed the auto industry. This is undeniable. Ask yourself, when was the last time the auto industry was this interesting? When was the last time you saw these auto companies actually start to innovate? Never, until Tesla shook the market. And that's why people are betting highly on Tesla. They're the ones innovating in a brand new industry. And yes, EV's are a brand new industry. It's why auto companies are spending billions trying to revamp or create new manufacturing plants. It's why they are having huge supply chain shortages particularly for EV's. It's why GM had to pause sales on their Chevy Bolt for over 7 months because they had an exploding battery issue. New industry, not the same as ICE. Same way renewable energy products are different from oil. Both can be used as energy generation fuel but they are entirely different in composition. Ford's CEO even openly admits that they are trying to copy Tesla. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, her entire EV strategy is literally what Tesla did..... like 6 years ago.4. What's the P/E of VW, Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, etc., if you only include their EV segment? Because that's what matters here and that is what many of you are are missing. Tesla isn't in the business of competing against other EV companies as much as they are in the business of taking market share from ICE companies. Right now, outside of luxury EV models such as the Porsche Taycan, there are no profitable EV's other than Tesla's. And it will be that way for many more years. So if you're going to be fair and start comparing P/E of these EV initiatives, at least look at the broader comparison. Why compare ICE vehicles, a dying industry, to EV vehicles? Look across the board: Almost every auto company in the world are looking to stop selling ICE vehicles by 2040 (latest). California already plans to ban ICE sales by 2035. Using the P/E and market cap of an ICE company to compare against an EV company is the same logic as saying 'Why buy Apple stock when they released the iPhone instead of Nokia?' They both sold phones and Nokia had a much larger revenue/profit than Apple at that time. There were many Apple pessimists who made such claims... stating that no one wanted a touch screen phone, it's a fad, it won't last, etc., 5. Tesla already has the highest margins in the auto business outside of exotic luxury vehicles. Think about it from this perspective: While other auto companies lose money for every EV they sell, Tesla makes the highest in the industry for every EV they sell. That's because Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto company in the world dating back to the fact that many of their parts couldn't be purchased elsewhere and they had to use cost-saving measures due to the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. That mindset led to Tesla constantly innovating in engineering. Their gigaStamp is a revolutionary process in creating the vehicle chassis and significantly reduces costs. Even the car seats are made by Tesla. The software, made by Tesla. Batteries are made by Tesla and with strong emphasis on 4680, they will likely be one of the biggest battery makers in the future as well. Auto companies historically do not do this type of shit. They are just assembly lines. They get the parts and build the car. While that's a good thing for ICE, it's a bad thing for EV's. Software is the biggest key here. VW recently came out and stated that their software will likely be outsourced to Apple instead... AKA, Apple Carplay. They don't even know how to improve their software. Meanwhile, Tesla is capable of creating software allowing them to play Steam games, push OTA updates to perform self-driving features, improve vehicle performance, improve firmware for their cameras. Much like how you would buy a laptop or phone, the software capabilities for a vehicle will largely be the differentation as competition increases.6. Tesla is already going to be the most profitable auto company in the U.S. by this year. By next year, they will be the most profitable auto company in the world. For reference, Tesla only became profitable on an annual basis in 2020. So in a span of five years, they would have went from being unprofitable to being the most profitable auto company. The numbers are insane when you look at it... Per vehicle sold, Tesla is already the most profitable company. Automakers like VW and Toyota largely made vehicles that are low profit-per-unit but they earn money through high volume. If they can't push towards more EV sales in the future, they are going to be toast. BMW and Benz are high profit automakers. Yet, neither of them sell any EV's that are affordable compared to their ICE version. The performance of those ICE versions also significantly outperform their EV's so in a sense, there is no incentive to purchase their EV's currently. Toyota doesn't even believe in BEV's. They are still of the mindset that hydrogen fuel is the way to go because after spending billions of $, they are too stubborn to admit it was a failure. All they push out are Hybrids and they did so because they wanted to meet the regulatory standards and not be hit with a carbon tax. They are falling BEHIND..... So let me guess, Tesla is a cult? In two years, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world while selling a product (EV's) that other automakers will  be losing money selling. Sign me up!7. I've been investing in Tesla since 2014... Believe me, the amount of criticism that Tesla gets today pales in comparison to what they received in 2018 when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. This is peanuts. It went from, 'EV's are a fad, Tesla can't mass manufacture EV's, they will be bankrupt, they're only profitable because of regulatory credits, other competition is coming (Oh, really, the same automakers who pledge to go fully EV in 15 years but the competition is coming...?). Heard it all by now. This isn't anything new. 8. Not even going to go on about their energy storage capabilities, supercharging network, AI expertise (currently the largest AI company in the world), robotics (watch their AI event next week), Tesla insurance, no dealership model, FSD, etc.,... Those are things you can either choose to believe or not believe in. I'm more focused on the fact that they are the only company even willing to engage in all of this. That shows me a company that is constantly innovating. The very fact Tesla does all this while other automakers don't should tell you one thing: They don't have the expertise nor are they focused on shareholder value. Hence, why auto companies have been terrible performers in the stock market for the past two decades until Tesla ignited the EV formula and now you're seeing companies like BYD, NIO, XPENG, LUCID, RIVIAN, etc., all pop up trying to take market from the ICE segment. Remember, they are not competing against each other as much as they are competing for the ICE sales.This dude runs a company that builds rockets and wants to take civilization to Mars.... Think about that for a second. You might say it's stupid and I would probably agree with you. But this is the type of person you are dealing with. Once he stepped into the auto business, it became revolutionized. Once he went into the aero industry, he revolutionized it. This is not a person you want to bet against and the market will find that even more evident when Tesla and SpaceX both become top five companies in the world by market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 11:15:14'] This is one of the easiest and simplest answer to give. There are currently many uncertainties in the broader market right now due to the state of the economy and inflation. Most of these do not affect Tesla though as the auto industry is undergoing an evolution, and this evolution will not stop regardless if there is a recession or not. A valuation of a company is based on many many forces in the market, its industry, itself, etc. The force of evolution in the auto market is relatively strong compared to the general market. So other companies, their value is going down because of these uncertainty and most of the companies you mentioned are mature, and therefore is more exposed to these effects than a company that is part of an evolution / revolution.&#x200B;Tesla's growth trajectory in terms of sales is one of the most reliable in today's market. As in the last year, despite the many supply chain issues plaguing the whole industry, both EV and legacy auto, Tesla still managed to grow by 40-50% or more. No other car company in the world is doing this consistently quarter by quarter like Tesla, in fact no other company. This is because of this revolution that Tesla has spearheaded and it has become the main beneficiary of this revolution and downturn.&#x200B;Think of it this way, when the world decided to adopt cellphones, or touchscreen phones, did the state of the economy prevented these things to happen? No. It might slow it down a little bit, but this slow down is like a miniscule amount. This is what is happening with Tesla.&#x200B;Similar to how Amazon came out of the 2008 unscathed and even bigger than before, despite the huge downturn during this time. The downturn actually emphasized how great of a company Amazon is during this time as before 2008, it was competing head to head with eBay. After 2008, eBay is now barely a competitor to the giant Amazon has become. The downturn accelerated this process, and that is what has happened with Tesla during Covid and will continue in the next coming years. So even if we enter a recession, Tesla's stock will get hit similar like everyone else, but it will come out like an Amazon coming out of the 2008 recession.&#x200B;Personally I have identified Tesla as the next blue chip similar to how I felt 10 years ago Amazon is the next blue chip company. So during covid, I feel that Tesla is one of the safest companies to invest in due to their stellar and consistent track record and a crazy moat of advantage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 08:08:02'] Because Tesla continues to beat expectations and grow rapidly. A few of the catalysts for growth both now and in the near future include:* Giga Berlin and Austin continue to ramp up rapidly, which will greatly increase the number of vehicles Tesla produces in the future.* It's rumored that Tesla will soon announce at least one new upcoming Gigafactory soon, possibly on their next earnings call. There's a decent amount of evidence that they're strongly considering Canada for the next location. Regardless of where it is though, once that factory is built and ramped in a few years it'll be producing a half a million vehicles a year most likely. * With the above 2 points, it's increasingly obvious that Tesla can definitely hit a 10 million vehicle per year production mark in the future, putting them on the same level as other auto companies like Toyota.* Tesla has consistently proven to be able to navigate the supply shortages much better then the other automakers, even while continuing to expand and produce more vehicles each year. * We're getting more solid information about when the Cybertruck will finally start to come out, likely next year. Once they do then that'll almost certainly cause a nice increase in Tesla's sales.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:42:39'] They are out performing expectations while other companies lowered/missed their expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 12:37:09'] My peers think I’m crazy for having TSLA as my largest position, but I think the numbers show why I’m extremely bullish. -Massive profit margins on each vehicle sold. >25%-Insane revenue growth YOY @ 60%-Large amounts of cash on hand, $18.9B as of Q2-Almost everything is made in-house -An AppStore is on the horizon and I believe it’s going to exponentially increase their revenue as developers and startups begin innovating apps for Tesla’s, similar to when AAPL released their AppStore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:51:32'] Your data points make it seem like Tesla has not suffered at all in the recent downturn.  They are still -25% their 1 year high and dropped as hard or harder than other tech blue chips, just earlier as befitting a more so speculative stock.The better question is why have they recovered faster.  I think it’s a combination of still amazing revenue/margin numbers and their investor storytime dreams of half the world driving Tesla’s in 10 years (along with all the possible new products and services that they could have but don’t actually have yet).  I’m expecting another big correction in the disastrous event that they are able to meet car demand in the next few years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 07:04:41'] I think two main reasons: 1. They are profitable and don’t seem to show signs of slowing down as raising interest rates threaten the growth of a lot of growth oriented businesses. It remains to be seen if they can “weather the storm” as rates keep hiking, but so far, they are doing quite well.2. The infrastructure bill and Inflation Reduction Act that were passed this year contribute billions towards electric vehicle infrastructure and adoption. A lot of EV related stocks have seen a strong pop this year as a result (go look at lithium and EV charging stocks and you’ll see a similar trend for the year).

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 03:51:56'] don't be surprised if it comes crashing down.... Tsla has a powerful narrative thats just keeping ppl invested and is being used as a prop in some portfolios holding huge short interest... Retail wants it because they dont understand the risk of holding jt... and hedge funds cant let go of it because its the only thing they can go on to tv and pump to keep themselves afloat... Elon is taking profits while the getting is good... if you own this stock you should too

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 05:58:16'] Elon will likely have to sell due to the Twitter situation and he knows it.Reason why his having to sell is important here is because when he’s had to sell or wanted to sell in the past year, we have mysteriously see big time call option squeezes occur before then. Maybe there’s no connection, but something does smell a little.If there is a connection, this shouldn’t be legal, yes.If/when he does sell (the trial is soon), that will likely be where your new lows for the Nasdaq comes from this year because the way Tesla behaves can easily burn it down in flames. It pushes it around way too easily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 11:09:14'] A combination of Gamma Squeeze at it's finest, thousands of bots that shill the stock on every social media platform (including this one), and finally Musk who has no issue selling vapourware like FSD, semi, cybertruck for years and doubling down on it. If it  isn't "too big to fail" already, it might go down as the biggest fraud in the history. It's easy to spot a fraud, it's almost impossible to make money from it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 15:48:06'] First they take out the soldiers, then the generals. TSLA and AAPL are the “safe haven” stocks, and TSLA especially is the epitome of this tech bubble. They will be the last ones to go.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 16:13:21'] It’s because when Tesla gets good news, Tesla bulls buy. Tesla gets bad news, Tesla bulls buy harder. No news is bad news for Tesla. If Elon went silent and the stock just went quiet on news it would die from its investors getting bored
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 18:11:43'] So much BS about this meme stock. Fucking Musk nimrods are the left’s  Qanon. Car quality sucks but HAD innovative tech.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 08:31:13'] It's a cult stock. Avoid it. There's a reason smart people are shorting it. What they can't account for is fanboys spending their last money buying more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:02:27'] Every political and social tailwind points in support of the “green transition”, starting with the auto industry. And Tesla already has a well established sales and production model to lead this transition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:45:42'] My only prediction. Tesla is currently the “im better than you!” projection vehicle especially for the liberal elites. To say they are not happy with Elon is an understatement. They also are not happy that the lower class or “help” is getting Teslas as well. When APPL finally reveals their EV youll see a massive migration. Tesla will also become more accessible to lower income. Tesla will still rule the market, Self driving and App interface. APPl may not be as good, not at first. But it will be the beacon of Projection.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 20:12:38'] Tesla could be worth so much more if Elon just said the right things and kept riding his cool tech bro persona from a few years ago. Instead, his ego has gotten so big that it’s detrimental to the share price of Tesla.Buying Twitter at near its peak, getting overtly involved in left vs right politics, scandals involving his staff etc has made people wary of buying Tesla stock. How much of Teslas potential customer base will no longer buy a Tesla based on him picking a side in politics and being very noisy about it?It might only be 5 or 6% of people that won’t buy a Tesla when choosing an EV because of his opinions, but it terms of overall sales, that’s still a huge number. There are other CEOs who are very politically orientated, but they keep it on the down low and do it via political donations and fundraisers. Stuff that never really makes headlines.I’m not saying Elon is right or wrong with his opinions, just that it has the potential to influence a consumers decisions.He could have just played it safe and ridden that “cool tech guy” goodwill to Mars.

I know some of you will hate me for saying it... but it has to mean something when he keeps on selling and selling and selling.. Maybe he sees we have hit a big hurdle on valuation, coupled with the beginnings of a recession and increased competitive market.... by the time we come out of the recessing the competitive landscape for EV's will be very different... so he is doing what may of us don't do... he is selling high. he did diamond hands for a long time... but he no dummy.lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-10 06:24:08'] I really don’t see why people think he is going to be forced into buying Twitter.  Worst case scenario he might have to give them a billion dollars for not purchasing.  If I’m not mistaken there was a clause for refusing to complete the sale where he would have to pay out around 1 billion.  There’s no fucking way they are going to force him to pay 44 billion if they truly misrepresented anything about the company, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to be completely off the hook either.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla Inc.s shares dropped the most in three months after the carmaker blamed a disappointing deliveries report on shipment issues that increased the number of vehicles that were on their way to customers as the quarter came to a close.\n\nThe maker of Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers handed over 343,830 vehicles to customers in the last three months, short of the almost 358,000 total that analysts expected. The stock fell 8.2% at 11:20 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline since June 16.\n\nTesla has for years delivered big batches of vehicles toward the end of each quarter, a practice Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried to move away from by localizing production in all major regions. While the carmaker opened its first European factory in Germany in March, record shipping costs are still bedeviling the auto industry along with shortages of semiconductors and other components.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-02/tesla-delivers-record-343-830-cars-mis'

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:48:53'] So that's why there was a random Tweetstorm on Russia/Ukraine today, makes sense
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:03:13'] Honestly in this market it's amazing that an expensive company that disappointed isn't down double digits. It's incredible how well TSLA has held up this year all things considered. If you told me at the start of the year that NASDAQ, Bitcoin and certain growth stocks would be down as much as they are today I'd have thought TSLA would be down 60-70% easy.The only way I can explain it is that there are just two groups of people when it comes to TSLA... One group is the long-term, die hard believers, and the other group are those that believe it's insanely overvalued, but have lost money shorting it for years. If you look at the short interest between 2020-2021 the shorts seemed to just give up and never came back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:09:21'] Well that would explain Elon going absolutely mental on Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:06:16'] For a company predicated on 40-50% annual EPS growth for 5 years to get to fucking NASDAQ 100 average PE, you need to deliver (literally).
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 14:50:45'] This is almost exactly what happened after the Cybertruck announcement. Stock got pumped as people bought the rumors, people were disappointed by the announcement leading to a stock crash, and then people realized it wasn’t the end of the world and the stock continued rallying. In fact, this happens at a lot of their announcements. Despite what the bears claim, this is a solid company with many years of massive growth ahead of them. The more the share price falls, the more I’m buying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 15:00:36'] I don't know much but I'm a buyer
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 14:50:30'] They missed delivery estimates by 6k units.  What an over reaction. Perfect time to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:30:19'] Meh. Those cars are sold but just in transit to be delivered. If you buy x on Amazon and it's on the way to you, have you bought it and has amazon sold it? Yes.So stupid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:03:10'] Record deliveries “disappointing” lmao
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:56:28'] [Company] Falls Most Since June as Quarterly Deliveries Disappoint.You can probably post this for 99% of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 02:17:46'] Just read this article about record deliveries… “missing targets” is about semantics. The cars were in route.https://cleantechnica.com/2022/10/02/tesla-achieves-record-343830-deliveries-in-3rd-quarter-breaking/
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 05:15:49'] If only Tesla gave guidance that they were going to change their delivery cadence from end of quarter rush to a more economical method. Which they did and still likely to increase deliveries 50% year over year. Are these the same analderps that think TSLA is still just a car company?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:34:04'] Some clarity:Essentially what happened was Chinese customers held off buying in anticipation of a price reduction to fit with Chinese subsidies expected in October. This caused Tesla to pivot and send the cars overseas to be sold and ~22k cars are currently in transit. They won’t count towards Q3 because they haven’t been delivered. But they have owners already and are essentially sold.So the actual numbers are a bit deceiving. There is certainly not a production problem as they produced ~365k. And no demand problem either as it was simply pushed back in China. Solid quarter as production is most important right now in an environment where they can sell every car they make.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 15:07:30'] The drop is nuts. Deliveries don't matter, production does. They exceeded expectations in terms of production, and the delivery miss is just because they have sold cars in transit. If you annualize Q3 earnings, they're gonna be at a PE of ~40, with 160% YoY earnings growth. PEG of 0.25 when 1.5-3 is the norm for large caps. This valuation is getting so incredibly low, it makes zero sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:12:17'] TSLA gonna be OK, might pick up a few more shares when it hits $215
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 11:58:31'] Tesla is a great company. Its just matter of valuation, and realistic exceptions. I think the best way to visualize how nonsensical the valuation is to just look at market share. Some people are convinced that Tesla is going to take 15% of the global automobile shares over the next 5 years, which is ridiculous.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:02:00'] Too much growth that might never happen is priced in. If it was at realistic valuations, then Elon would have to dump over 80% of his shares to pay his stupid TWTR contract, which would crash the price even more because of slippage/illiquid markets. TSLA is kinda fked because of these 2 factors.Even if it holds on at current prices, how will it absorb 44 Billion dollars worth of sales in a short period (his TWTR debt), plus a lot more billions to pay his taxes on these sales (20-40% tax rate? $10-$24.5 Billion additional sales).TSLA is a classic meme stock, and as usual the original holders (the musk family) are simply dumping their shares on retail mom and pops buying it. Check insider activity, 0 shares bought in 12 months, 34 million presplit shares sold for tens of billions in past 12 months, just dumped on bagholders.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 17:40:24'] Tesla has been a public company for 12 years now.  They purposely eschewed the dealer model because it was supposed to be a better way to do business and make them more profitable.Again this quarter they have shown that they still cannot handle logistics to get the cars they are making to the customers so they can record the sale.  It's a material impact on their financial statement.  Its starting to look like they have no plan to get this under control and its going to be costly to fix.  The same for the service issues.  To me that weighs more heavily on future growth than any of the other factors people are citing.  If they can't get their logistics sorted at this level of sales then it's only going to get worse as they bring on more production and more models. Their gross margin will suffer because they are stuck with an inefficient and costly logistics system that they appear to be unable to fix.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 14:53:37'] My father's employer had around 44 trucks that were loaded in the morning,  driven, unloaded, and driven back for a second run in the afternoon. It sounds like the tesla trucks would work out great for them. I  think there're a lot of companies with this kind of pattern.  For instance,  the usps has drivers that do out and back runs between distribution centers daily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 11:15:52'] I mean are they really? Tesla and Elon say a lot of shit. One thing they always get wrong are timelines. I highly doubt they will deliver by December and if they do, it will be like 1 semi with a ton of issues
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 12:16:58'] EVs don’t make sense for the majority of semi truck drivers out there that you’re talking about delivering goods from state to state. You’re not going to have a driver go 500 miles in 9 hours(55 mph), then wait hours for a recharge. Truck drivers like to drive right up to the legal limits to make the most money. You also have to figure in that after the 500 miles they must have an available charger. I’m not sure that the infrastructure is there yet for that. Gas is so much more convenient. You find a station, which you can always find even in very rural areas, and you’re in and out in 5 minutes.With that said, some local companies will I’m sure hop on if they can get one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 16:18:32'] Tesla has been delivering me semis for years!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 10:38:00'] The real opportunity in trucking is self-driving trucks, not so much the switch to electric which is very costly with the cost (and weight) of batteries.  Hydrogen may make more sense for trucks (and other larger shipping methods) for quite a while.As for their "plans" on producing 50K semis in 2024...I have my doubts. Might end up like with their cybertruck and many other future predictions.I really would want them to find a way to make competitively-priced light trucks and SUVs since that is a huge part of the consumer market and their current offerings are way too expensive for most of the market.

Trucks at truck stops will line up to fuel up a lot of times and his point was how are you going to insure that there are sufficient charging stations? Drivers don’t always fuel up on their breaks and with hours of service / ELOGS a constant concern electric trucks may be relegated to short / day trips until charging grid is country wide.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 20:03:34'] Not only the fuel savings, but there’s no turbo, no complicated exhaust, no DEF to keep topped up. As long as they didn’t make it a complicated maintenance nightmare it would be way more economically friendly than today’s diesel big rigs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 22:41:39'] A lot of the big Class 8 truck manufacturers like Mack and Peterbilt are starting to offer hybrid and EV drivetrains that have a small onboard battery that is charged by hydrogen. This is more practical as it negates the need for a large battery pack and also offers fast charging as fueling up with hydrogen is done in minutes vs an hour+ for a full BEV truck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 23:29:15'] It will take too long to recharge the trucks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 05:12:31'] I’d bet my truck Tesla semis will not be able to perform the task they are designed for as well as the existing tech.  Electric trucks will not have the ability to transport heavy loads for long distances before the batteries run out, with drastic changes in distance per charge depending on load.  The battery is likely so large that it eats up your payload.  How many charging stations have you seen in the middle of the country?  Have to replace a battery?  The cost would be incredibly higher than standard diesel maintenance.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 06:32:12'] LOL, they do not have the range they need before they need to be charged again. Will only be viable in cities that mandate limited emissions, such as LA or San Francisco.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 08:10:02'] The truck was unveiled 5 years ago.   Production was supposed to start back in 2019 when TSLA was a $20 stock. Could be the hype about this truck is why it is a $200 stock.   This truck's success is priced in.  It's failure is not.50k trucks would be about 1/4 of all the new trucks sold in a year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 08:59:43'] Not to mention these trucks use a large amount of electricity, the infrastructure needed to charge these takes a lot of initial investment. Up front costs are large. I think that’s another big reason

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 02:05:54'] A big factor I have t seen mentioned is how much it costs to charge a semi/ vs how much money it costs for them to sit for 30 min to charge. I’m guessing it costs maybe a few dollars to charge? Multiply that by a yearly savings and it becomes very much worth it to just drive them and deal with the charge. Your margins would go up considerably.But the transition is inevitable. Big buisness will adopt these in droves. But I’m sure no one wants to make a big investment “first”. Glad Pepsi took the plunge. Fed ex, ups, Amazon will probably jump in next. Not sure who is up for making them.

Will let some ride, however.Congrats on the gains.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 14:47:57'] I was buying Meta on the way down from $225 to $130 eventually getting it up to around 12% of my portfolio so I wasn’t able to buy more when it was around $100 or below. I have been trimming my position as it got above $200+. I just submitted a stop sell order today to sell my remaining position. I don’t want to cut my winners short when it’s in such a strong uptrend, but Meta got expensive fast. Meta is currently sitting at a 30+ P/FCF which people forgot this is a value stock. They have little room for growth with already 3.5 billion MAUs, they’re dependent on the cyclicality of the advertising market. I can live with missing out on Nvidia and Tesla, selling Microsoft and Meta too early, but I can’t live with giving up all of my gains because I held onto a stock that was overvalued for its fundamentals. I will say that I don’t see a fundamental difference between Meta at $80 and Meta at $280.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 05:10:27'] Jonas has always been one of Musk's biggest cheerleaders, as well as the person responsible for some of the more annoying questions on various car company conference calls.As for companies with exposure to China, I'd be concerned with anything that has talked about a "china growth story" - Starbucks (which was down quite a bit yesterday) being another example.Edit: I'm not sure why there's so much eagerness for investing in China/defense of anything negative. You clearly have a government that is not market friendly:"These cracks were well-flagged. The trigger was the surprise appointments of China’s power apex unveiled on Sunday. Contrary to hopes that Xi would at least nod to balancing factional powers within the Party, reform-minded Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Wang Yang lost their seats at the seven-men politburo standing committee. Instead, he filled it with his own protégés including Beijing Party Chief Cai Qi and Shanghai Party Chief Li Qiang. The latter had ordered weeks of Covid-19 lockdowns earlier this year in the Chinese financial hub despite its devastating impact on the economy. He is now tipped to become China’s next premier. The selloff reflects investors’ fears that a more powerful Party leadership will increasingly prioritise the state at the cost of the private sector. Mollifying that message will be a tough early test for Xi’s new economic team." (https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/xi-jinpings-third-term-gets-markets-thumbs-down-2022-10-24/)These names will probably bounce soon because the selling is getting excessive, but if there's a bounce rather than take it as some sort of victory lap that the China investment thesis is still a thing, it should be regarded as a selling opportunity. You've already had instances in recent years of officials trying to walk back market unfriendly policies only to eventually add more. Now you have a government that's likely to be even less market friendly. It's not even a matter of whether one believes in the GDP or not, it's that - at the core - the market thinks that the people elected are not going to be market friendly. The government there is not going to view the market as the priority and that's fine and their choice and there's plenty of other places to look for investments around the world. If there is further evidence that China will be one regulation after another, you're going to have investors who are not going to pay the valuations they once did because of the risk that any day the government there will decide it doesn't like the industry your investment is in.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 06:22:15'] What a bunch of nonsense. The biggest issue with Chinese stocks is that the companies are fully owned by the Chinese government. Comparing Tesla to that is just stupid.Also, Tesla generated only 24% ($5.13B) of their Q3 revenue in China. 50% of their profit would be $1.65B. So that would mean they'd making 32% net income in China compared to 12% in the rest of the world. That's just ridiculous to even suggest. No idea what Morgan Stanley is thinking here...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:24:30'] To be fair to the bulls, it's not like this is a hype stock that has no earnings and is just pure magic in the air. There is a strong underlying business with good fundamentals. The question now is whether the price reflects a fair value that you should pay for that business.Despite the YoY revenue declines, I think once the economy emerges the other side of this inflation battle, that downtrend will have been temporary. However I do think this stock is being priced to perfection, and the expected growth argument I've seen from multiple bulls is that this price action brings it into line with other big Tech (P/E in the 25 region or so). This growth argument is expecting all of the chips falling Nvidia's way (excuse the pun) over the medium term which in my view is highly optimistic. I can see this stock pulling back back but I think the days of this being a below $200 stock may be over unless economic shit hits the fan.

Gross margins are trending towards 70%. Datacenter TAM is $600B, for now there is no substitute for nvidia gpus for AI workloads. If AI is that important can nvidia garner 10-30% of that TAM, then you get $100B in Datacenter revenue, $20 eps, 20-25x earnings multiple. It’s just that easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:07:36'] AI is already being hailed as the next world-changing technology, a step change from what has come before. As an comparison, think about the invention of the the smartphone and the internet. It's too early to tell who exactly will stand to gain most from the new paradigm, but NVDA is the obvious pick-and-shovels play for investors with a decade plus time horizon. At this point Wall Street basically doesn't care about the current valuation and will buy every dip possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:34:34'] I've been buying Nvidia pretty consistently from 2020 till end of 2022.  I haven't bought more this year.  I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    I don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen.

They bet that the internet would permanently alter the course of human history and MSFT would stay at the forefront.They were 100% correct.  Were they early?  Absolutely.  Was their market timing suboptimal?  Absolutely.But were they right and still made tons of money?  Yes.  Does it matter THAT much they bought in the 50s / high 40s vs. $25?  Not really even though it felt like a painful drop.People are betting that this is the horse of the future.  Time will only tell if they end up looking like geniuses or fools but either way humanity will benefit massively from the ridiculous flow of capital to AI.

I see it finishing the year at around $300 per share although as with anything I could be wrong. I stupidly sold the other chip stock that went up today (AMD) the other week in the $90s although I did sell a majority of my AMD holdings at $155 in 2021. Also stupidly sold NVIDIA in the early 200s towards the end of last year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:18:14'] When we drove the interest rate into the ground we violated the cardinal rule of fiat money: it can never be cheaper to borrow than it is to hold. In other words, inflation made the real interest rate drop below zero, meaning borrowing cost nothing and holding money meant you lost money (to inflation).What that did was separate price from value. A thing’s price no longer reflects what it’s value is. Hence the spike in trillion dollar companies.None of this is sustainable and when we hit the wall it’ll be brutal
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:32:00'] I actually found this post cause I was just thinking that it feels like we are in a tech / AI bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 19:43:57'] Nvdia will be a hugely profitable company but the valuation is for the future, not yet now. It will come back down to earth but I wouldn't be surprised if it sees $500 first.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 20:39:58'] What puzzles me is that AMD is right there with slightly slower GPUs. It's not like NVidia has a monopoly or some revolutionary patented tech.I'm just assuming this is a pure Dotcom-style bubble.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 20:46:18'] Look back at prior PE ratios for companies like NFLX, AMZN, etc. a mega growth stock can “grow into” its sky high PE ratio.   Whether NVDA can remains to be seen, but I’m a hold.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 21:04:07'] It's not.  But it is a good company.The bifurcation of sentiment and reality is amplified by there still being too much money sidelined and QT not hitting hard enough yet, or frankly ever.The S&P feels shaky with this much tech though.  Especially since oil prices don't make much sense now either.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:18:04'] The market is in a controlled simulation right now. Fundamentals haven't mattered for a long time. If you take notice it is just a bunch of V's. The reason IMO why NVDA is so high is because it allows it to have a larger weight of QQQ. QQQ is forced to go up so this is how they get it done. If you notice they take turns pumping different large tech names on a day to day basis to keep the index up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:31:23'] All of this feels like Japan bubble. Just reading that bubble history on Wikipedia and the similarities are insane with huge property appreciation, bank behavior, and a central bank that decided to tighten too late.  Apple being worth more than UK stock market, NVDA valuation, people thinking DCA into VOO or QQQ will work forever, etc, these are things we may look back on in 20 years and say “it was all so obvious it was a top”.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:12:41'] There is a possibility it is overvalued for a hardware business, but this is one of those where it is not nearly as obvious as everyone thinks it is. You are not looking at future financial profile - not unrealistic to think GMs hit 70% next year with the unprecedented demand. Is it sustainable, who knows?If the AI train is not all hype (and for those paying attention, there’s reasons to think it’s not), then this will be downright cheap. If you can provide the raw tools that enable you to create 10 billion workers out of thin air, a 1 trillion valuation will look laughable. Remember, the majority of economic value accrues to businesses which provide the picks and shovels. Even if it is hype, NVDA benefits from hype alone. This is the same issue with those who were screaming TSLA was so overvalued when it was between $100-$500bn in market cap. You have to look at it on a forward basis and be a little thoughtful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:13:03'] I just buy stocks that I like and use in real life. Nvidia make good graphics cards, they will probably dominate the hardware industry once it all moves into the cloud, which I am likely to use. Also AI, I've read about how they're looking forward in that regard and I am using AI more and more. Not much thought past that tbh. I'll be working and investing for the next 40 years, so the recent downtrends will hopefully just be a good time to buy up.  I'm starting with risky stocks, will then move into sectors like recycling and waste management, then ETFs and less risky stocks. Please lmk if this is stupid, I've re-entered investing with different strategies the past few years and this is what I've drawn up so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:12:11'] The idea is that people will need their tech for ai -and people think ai is going to make more money then the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:28:43'] Yesterday, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang said that as more companies integrate AI, $1 trillion worth of outdated data center equipment would have to be swapped out for new chips. This represents an maybe unheard of market opportunity. So I think the stock price jump yesterday was mostly based on the position Nvidia sits with regards to a potential $1T market opportunity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:32:26'] you are asking the wrong question. Nvidia is not pumping for fundamental reasons. Fundamentally they look terrible. the reason Nvidia is pumping right now is because it is being pumped. the media has been pumping AI all year long and also pumping this idea that Powell is going to pivot nowNvidia is going up because of these 2 things. Its a pump and dump. The media was brought in to pump the story and get retail investor bagholders excited and buy in so the insiders and intstitutional money could get outCathie Wood ARKK sold a shit ton of Nvidia not too long ago precisely because the fundamentals are terrible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 03:03:27'] IMHO Nvidia is only so big as there is was not a serious competitor in the last years. The take over of ATI by AMD in 2006 was the biggest present for Nvidia as AMD started to struggle and started to cut down all R&D budgets leading to about 10 years of development gap between them. But Intel and AMD are making progress so it is possible that Nvidia will not be in that position in a few years anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:09:07'] Nvidia owns the AI hardware market. More AI developers use their GPUs and software toolkits than any other, by a wide margin.The dominant leader in a market tends to support inflated valuations for extended periods of time.Until recently we would never imagine Google losing its dominance in the search market. The lead that Amazon has in being a global marketplace is practically insurmountable. Say what you want about Tesla and competition, but they have an insurmountable lead in software development and the vast amounts of data required to cement their leadership.These "cream of the crop" companies are rare and every institution wants to hold them.Is Nvidia "overvalued?" Sure. It was probably overvalued at $300. And it will be overvalued at $500 later this year.The market decides the value of a stock. The more we get hung up on questioning the rationality of the market, the more we miss opportunities. History shows again and again, long-term market leaders had inflated valuations *before* they made their big runs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 15:53:35'] Honestly, if Nvidia continues its projected huge growth over the next 5 - 10 years it could easily be worth well well over 1 trillion to power the future of technology and AI. Nvidia is a beast and it's expensive for a reason

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:47:27'] People will say and do anything to take shots at Tesla.1. Highest fcf in a quarter by Tesla ever by over $522 million. Q1 tends to be the strongest quarter for vehicles so for Q3 to beat Q1 by over $522 million shows how capable this company is at making money.2. Margins have been decreasing because Austin/Berlin represents a higher % of vehicles being sold. That along with increased costs for labor/supply chain has affected them like it has with every company. It isn't specific to Tesla. They have also been pumping money into the 4680 cells which are not yet scaled. $250 million in currency depreciation took a toll on their profits as well.3. Regulatory credits revenue has declined because there are fewer vehicle sales in the market. The negative for Tesla is it's unlikely they will ever see the $600 million amount they saw in Q1 but regulatory credits are such a small part and won't play a role in the future. It will eventually hit $0.4. Operating income is worth focusing on because the overall auto industry has seen a declining operating margin. Tesla has increased their operating margin significantly going from 14.6% Q3-2021 to 17.2% Q3-2022.5. They still expect to hit 50% yoy in deliveries. I don't believe they will hit that mark for this year but maybe they can pull it off. Expected net income for year 2022 is about $13 billion. That would put them as the most profitable automaker in the United States and probably only behind Toyota and VW. They will surpass them by 2023.The biggest factor right now would be the $7.5k tax credit. I personally know a few people who are waiting on that tax credit before ordering.It was a decent quarter. Nothing overly bad/good. Just lots of unpredictability in the overall market so you have to absolutely kill it, like Netflix did, to get some traction right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:18:43'] Really solid numbers but the key is Q4 estimates now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:25:51'] They beat EPS and had a slight miss on revenue (56% YoY increase). In this environment that's a win.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:23:02'] So they lagged deliveries by 22,000 vehicles and doubled thier inventory from last year from $5B to over $10B.  If they start not being able to sell the number of cars that they produce then there goes that 50% growth.  Granted people in the US may be putting off the purchase till Jan for the new tax credits.  It's either that or people are starting to tighten thier belts for the looming recession.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:11:54'] like all CEOs they control the major stuff: final call to where to build factories, final call on biz partners, final call on high lvl workers, final call on major products.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 09:56:36'] Musk controls all the high level stuff. He decides where the company goes, how fast, etc. he’s the vision. Day to day stuff he’s much less important to the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 10:34:52'] This isn’t a direct answer. But good management is a key in any company. If you don’t like Elon Musk or trust him as a manager don’t invest in Tesla. If you like Elon and like the direction Tesla is going than look for an entry point you feel is fairly valued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:19:32'] How much he contributes to the operation and strategy? A lot, but I think the company would be fine long-term without him. As for how much he contributes to the stock price, a boat-load. Without him, $TSLA wouldn’t sell at the premium it does vs. the rest of the industry / market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:34:04'] He’s a very very very hands on leader, idk if any other major CEO out there truly understands their business the way Musk does. With that being said he is the top dog and makes all the critical decisions, for better or worse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:53:28'] Musk swings for the fences so I wouldn't buy the stock or short it lol.Like Jobs and Gates he has no empathy for others which is a big positive in a capitalistic society, he's willing to fire people without conscience. Has no problem demanding people sleep on the floor in the factory work 80 hour weeksThis all means he can make big changes very quickly. He will either succeed or fail spectacularly.Case in point Twitter,he will either bankrupt the company or issue a hundred billion dollar IPO. The daily changes he's making is just normal for him, he's going to keep trying stuff until something either works or he realizes it's hopeless, people think this is chaotic behavior but he likes to live in a chaotic world.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 01:35:11'] I used to work for tesla. Probably one of the most unorganized companies I’ve ever worked in
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 11:54:38'] From a stock standpoint I wasn’t an early investor, but I’m still positive in this market… but I do believe in the company, brand, vision, and product.I’d say he is still an instrumental part in the success and vision of the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 18:50:37'] The company was ground breaking and had an edge at a moment which happened to be at the exact time when the market bubble was growing during the pandemic.Its incredible to think that tesla was worth more than very serious companies like BMW or Volkswagen group.The cars are ok, not the best quality, they have great battery technology, but other large groups are very quickly closing the gap.I made a 250% gain and then had some losses, sold it at 215% gain before it all went to shit.I dont see it growing the way it did a couple of years ago to be honest. Companies with a lot more experience at building cars will catch up, and offer better assembled cars for less money. They are already doing it. Especially since Europe approved a total ban on gasoline cars for 2035.But this is just my opinion, I could be a complete idiot
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 15:58:52'] Wow it’s shockingly refreshing to see reasonable takes at the top of this thread. I expected pure venom that Reddit typically throws at Elon
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:40:56'] I think the next factory for Tesla is in Indonesia
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 09:53:28'] In short: way too much control, considering he’s an impulsive child. That won’t last forever.The control, I mean, not the impulsive child thing. The board will fire him eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 14:02:43'] He just sold something like $4B of his TSLA stock.  Best or worst innovator on the planet does not make that disappear.  My thoughts on TSLA at the moment is it needs to reprove itself as a major player, not an over-capitalized toy to be manipulated by one man.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:51:32'] To, Me Elon is a Brand , He's a Celebrity , A fashion statement  A Steve Jobs,and Con man / sales man. And a visionary of his time who has been able to deliver. He's a Brand like Trump
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 15:21:31'] Don’t buy Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:09:29'] Tesla is as much a software company as it is a car company.  Biggest advantage Tesla has: Brightest team of engineers in the world. Employees of Elon’s companies all work on Elon’s all engineering issues ie: from improving cars to building rockets. Example: Tesla used material created by SpaceX in Tesla cars Twitter code was sent to Tesla programmer for review 100% vertically integrated. No supply side issues even during pandemic. Most advanced self-driving software by years vs other companies. Robotaxi expected to launch in 2024.   Revenues from fully self-driving cars can be bigger than current Tesla revenues.    Financials: Tesla profit margins are the best in the car industry. Tesla earns 8 times more profit per car than Toyota. Tesla achieved a 55% YoY automotive sales growth. Gross profit surged by 42% YoY to $5.2 billion while maintaining a gross margin of 28%. This dynamic enabled Tesla to deliver $0.95 in GAAP EPS, a 98% YoY increase.    Growth: Elon said: “Tesla's greatest, long-term opportunities may lie in robotics powered by artificial intelligence” . PS:  The same software used for automation driving can be implemented for robots to do basic jobs. Tesla will achieve a production run-rate of 2 million vehicles by the end of this year, and the goal is 20 million vehicles by the end of the decade.   Risk short term:  Democrats have a grudge against Elon Musk and over the next 2 years they will up the ante against him. Be ready to see much more controversial news about his companies. Elon continues to sell shares to fund his Twitter purchase. This is frustrating many Tesla shareholders. Regulations too slow to develop on self-driving can be an issue for his robotaxi fleet.   I continue to believe that Tesla will be the largest company by market cap in next 5 years. 
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 10:07:57'] Reddit is not the place to ask about Tesla or Elon Musk. Reddit is full of losers who are jealous. Here you don’t know anything about the people who give their opinion
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 18:35:07'] Musk is a visionary. Ignore the noise and buy the dip. See you at Mars 2023 :) $1k per share!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 18:10:08'] Musk does everything from stock pumping to writing code to cleaning the urinals. It’s basically a one man company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 19:11:04'] A lot of the other comments forgot his most important job- lying to customers and investors to pump TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:50:14'] Why you people are talking about Tesla is truly baffling to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:02:55'] Watch how he is running twitter right now.  Check off all of the "bad leaders do this" as he publicly melts down.  His companies have promise, but that man is an incompetent leader, and I think this might be the beginning of the end to some of his companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:37:19'] Musk is the face of Tesla. He is not an engineer or anything but he has final say in stuff. He gives the announcements, updates, etc. If he sells shares or says something stupid on twitter, Tesla stock goes down. Tesla stock price is tied to Elon Musk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 11:37:16'] Musk maintains a controlling stake, and appoints friends and family to the board to keep things tightly under his control. I believe there are a lot of names shared between Tesla an SpaceX in terms of share holders and board members. Basically, whatever Elon wants the company to do, it does.In terms of day to day, he mostly leaves that to people below him. His time seems to be spent more on micromanaging, and well tweeting quite a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 14:39:29'] He contributes about zero to the development and tech, he just makes the higher up decisions. He isn’t even the innovator of Tesla he took over owner ship through a legal battle with the actual innovators.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:38:53'] 100%
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 14:58:33'] “Controls” as in shares, or “controls” operations?  Per Siri, Elon owns 22% and his brother owns 20.8%.  I’m unsure as of what date that reflects.  He “controls” day to day operations because he is the CEO, but he is obviously not there daily.  My impression is that he gets his hands dirty when he thinks it’s necessary, otherwise he has a group of well trusted lieutenants that keep him in the loop.  The final part of your question is very subjective, and I have no first-hand knowledge, but I know that historically he has been a key component of their success
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 17:08:36'] That’s out of bounds…
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 17:36:31'] Best case scenario musk has to sell out of a majority position and we can get a real CEO, then moonshot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 18:40:51'] Probably the greatest salesman in a century
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 05:19:10'] Elon also is called when people get stuck on a problem. He is involved in solving the biggest problems, adding significant value. But overall the biggest thing is decision making iwht a long horizon. Without Elon 6-12 month horizon with Elon 20 yera horizon and big inspiring goals.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 10:26:59'] Don't rely on reddit replies. You won't get accurate information.  Do your own research
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 12:08:35'] > the degree to which Musk controls the company(a.) 100%>the degree to which he contributes to its successful operation.(b.) Unknown & unknowable

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 16:59:20'] For what it's worth, working conditions at Tesla have ALWAYS been nose-to-the-grindstone, high burnout, high turnover. Even within the tech industry, which has a culture of long hours and hard work, Tesla is notorious for being a grindhouse where long hours are expected. These comments are not anything new from Mr. Musk. I have no problem with his comments because we are all entitled to our opinions. But I would LOVE to see some kind of backlash in terms of employees leaving for other tech firms who treat them better. Silicon Valley started because companies in the area started to lure away engineers from IBM, promising flexible hours and casual attire to contrast with IBM's rigid corporate culture. So if Tesla engineers start electing to work for companies that respect work-life balance (as much as I hate that term), then over time the culture will shift.But for the short term, Tesla will remain an incredibly sought-after position and they will likely be able to make these demands until the supply of fresh meat (aka - engineering grads) dries up.Source: Several friends who work/worked at Tesla from 2010 through now, SF Bay Area offices in various departments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 17:11:24'] He's going to bleed talent. High end technical people aren't playing the boomer "be in the office or else" games.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 15:18:42'] Elon says he works 100 hours a week but has time to woo and fk Amber Heard? When I was working 100 hours I couldn't even take a shower.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 14:26:55'] I think he's looking for an excuse to move the whole company out of the U.S. He's fairly good at telegraphing his intentions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 15:29:35'] Lowkey he's trying to get people to quit so he doesn't have to fire them and provide severance. Trouble in paradise brewing
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 18:28:30'] The comments saying that Musk is perfectly within his rights to require workers to come back to office are correct.  There are legitimate reasons to have even the people who aren't on the assembly to be present at the facility.  But his email was a terrible way to state this policy.    >that is why I lived in the factory so much- so that those on the line could see me working alongside them.   Yeah, I'm sure you bothering the line workers or sleeping on your office floor is what solved Tesla's production problems.    I'm gonna say I work in engineering and have worked in various industries.  I always knew there would be times when I would be expected to work more than the standard 40 hours/week. If the company was trying to get a new product out, or a customer was waiting for a delivery, you might have to work nights and weekends until it happened.  Most engineers I knew assumed the same.  But once things calmed down, you went back to 40 hours/week, and might even get some comp time for your efforts    In my experience, when you see:    >Everyone at Tesla is required to **spend a minimum of forty hours** in the office per week.    run away from that company.  It's sweatshop.  Every week will be crunch time, and you will be expected to spend lots of time in the office, while your boss watches to make sure you are.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 22:06:00'] James Dyson one of the most successful business stories in the UK also has a very strict work in the office stance and you could say he and Elon are very similar in their industries. I worked there for a while before covid and it also had a bustling and innovative atmosphere. One of the big things they did was how much they promoted the Dyson products to their own staff. Everyone spoke like they were brainwashed into believing how good these vacuum products were. That motivation and brainwashing stops when people are tuning in on zoom. The people who work there have to believe in the products and feel the emotions of walking around in the big offices and seeing James Dyson by their desk. It's part of what makes people want to work hard and stay at the company long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 20:34:55'] Sold my TSLA stock and moved it to Rivian and Lucid a couple of weeks ago. I’m sick of Elon’s shit and can’t look the other way anymore. I want to support EV’s. Not this piece of shit’s fragile little ego.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 22:03:40'] We’re supposed to be in the office like once a week but people barely even do that. We might average like 2-3 a month. Literally nobody is keeping tabs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 18:27:59'] I think he's onto something.  If there's one thing I've noticed during WFH, is that there are double the f\*cking stupid meetings when a company is online and no one likes to use their cameras.  I'm also guessing it's nice to work from home in a 10,000 sf house with an elegant den, but some of us find it a bummer to be imprisoned in our 600 sf apartments hearing people speak through shit quality microphones all day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 07:11:19'] I’m confused about the bull case for 2025.  Where does the extra production come from?  Fremont is at its physical limits.  Even if they double Austin and Berlin, how do you get to 4.8m without another factory?  IIRC it took about 2.5 years for Shangahai, Berlin and Austin to go from announced to making cars so any factory that is going to be making significant volume in 2025 needs to get started like yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 07:39:42'] I think your bear case is my most bullish case. I don't think they'll nearly double their sales by 2024, but even if they do and sell every car they produce, they are going to have a lot of trouble sustaining their margins when are already struggling at current levels of production. They are largely driven by hype, and Elon has done a great job blowing that up. Does TSLA have any products or technology that justify its valuation as a tech company? any competitive advantages? Their methods/sensors for FSD are inherently worse than what other auto makers are doing, and everything I see and hear is that their build quality is subpar. I expect they'll see a lot more competition very soon, and being valued more than all other auto makers combined =/= undervalued
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 10:54:55'] Are you accounting anything for other sectors too? I would love to read about your expectation about the energy and maybe the AI side of Tesla, and their ramp and expected revenue/income in future Q and years.I would estimate one or two more megapack factories being announced soon, and they could potentially have huge margins
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:20:47'] Great write up, I was on the side of Tesla still being undervalued, there is still a lot of growth to go. I know they have missed targets and deliveries before but I am sure mistakes have been learned from and expect Elon to deliver close to his predictions of 2 million deliveries this year, but anything more could prove a bit difficult and your 2.4m seems wishful thinking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:04:02'] Appreciate the write up. Question on your bull delivery number of 2.4 million - Elon said on the call that 2 million deliveries would be his bull case in 2023. Where do you see the extra 400,000 coming from? Has he sandbagged on deliveries in previous years and thus you’re adjusting for that? 20% over Elon’s bull case seems outlandish on first brush

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 02:29:12'] With the insane growth that TSLA bulls expect, you wouldn’t think they’d be able to cut 10% of jobs.  Maybe now that near 0% 84 month loans are going away, perhaps the average person won’t be able the throw 60k away on a car.

This at a time where the Cybertruck is still vaporware, and the Ford Lightning, Rivan and Hummer electric are all already being sold to the public. (Never mind theMach-E eating at Tesla sales and the upcoming swarm of VW electric vehicles).  Now he kneecaps his business by enforcing a report to work policy and threatening layoffs, in a company that is already known to treat its emplotees like shit and are anti union... another sore point with Tesla buyers..

Which mean if you work there, you need to be negotiating a higher salary to account for the unwritten rules of how much time they’re actually going to expect you to be there, on top of the commute time that just gets eaten every day. Being on premises makes it a lot easier to enforce those ‘rules’. Nevermind that there’s a point of diminishing returns in terms of workday length, it’s all about trying to show you’re grinding harder regardless if you’re actually getting anything done in that extra time or not.

I feel like I’m in the middle.  Tesla’s edge in EVs transcends their insane vertical integration, technology and manufacturing prowess, amazing revenue etc to include brand recognition and loyalty that is approaching Apple levels.  At the same time, they are valued as though selling 25m cars and charging 300 bucks a month for FSD subscriptions in 10 years is a lock.  I guess that’s why I don’t have any TSLA but would buy at the right price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 12:16:57'] Valuation is based on earnings and earnings growth. Tesla may be "just a car company", but Apple was once just a phone company and Amazon was once just a retailer (although now its valuation is based on AWS). The point is, it's not necessarily about what the company sells but how much the company earns and grows. A company could sell paper clips and command a 100 P/E if their earnings and growth rate support it. Going on a bit of a tangent, Tesla and Amazon  actually have very similar PEs and Amazon's is usually higher.There literally isn't another company that has both greater earnings (9.5B net income in the TTM despite Covid lockdowns in Shanghai in Q2) and growth rate (50% CAGR) than Tesla. And the upcoming Q3 will be another record-breaking quarter.And for additional context, Tesla's operating income growth is 225% in the TTM showing huge margin improvements. Even smaller, high growth, early stage companies do not grow as fast as Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 12:07:36'] Best thing is do your own research. Plenty of retail analysts / investors dig up tons of great info. Here's a small list to get you started. https://youtube.com/c/HitThatBidhttps://youtube.com/c/ElectrifiedSznhttps://youtube.com/c/TeslaDailyhttps://youtube.com/user/jrs97t (James Stephenson) Good to make your own informed decisions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 12:16:44'] The main issue is you can't value a company like Tesla by looking at the PE. PE is one metric that can be useful when evaluating mature companies that are showing financial consistency and easily comparable to others in a similar industry. It's a quick and dirty way to look at companies but you definitely have to look beyond just PE.  Is Tesla's value largely due to its software? AI? Vehicle? Battery? Supercharger Network? Manufacturing? The truth is that no one is scaling EV's at 50% a year and at the margin that they have. Auto industry is $2.5T. Right now, every Tesla sold is an ICE sale lost from legacy auto.Critics have been saying "Wait until Toyota, or VW, or Ford, or any other legacy auto start ramping up EV's" for 10 years. How many EV's GM sell last year? 30? How many are they selling this year? I just don't think many of the legacy auto, who have to divert their attention and resources to their ICE business for at least the next 10 years, will catch up to Tesla. That isn't to say things will always go right for Tesla but right now no other company is close to matching them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 14:01:08'] It is complicated and there is no way for someone to just explain it without you researching.Here is some things to consider. Tesla is making 30% profit margin on EVs (less for Q2 due to china lockdowns and ramping 2 new factories, will be back to 30% this quarter). Ford and GM make 5-7% profit margin on vehicles AND parts. (Tesla part sales goes into service revenue). That means Tesla makes 5x the profit on higher end cars. Every 1 car Tesla sells is equal to 5 cars Gm/F sells. (for profit).How does Tesla have such high margins? Giga castings  and having 2 main models, faster and cheaper to build. Tesla also making changes to lower the cost or performance daily. Gm/F makes 1 change per year. Tesla energy/storage just starting to rapidly grow in profits, should be well over 100 million in profits this quarter. Tesla is near complete with general autonomous software, which is not price in anyway. Mobileye relies on map and will only work where it has been tested. Tesla FSD works everywhere. Demand. I think everyone can agree that operating an EV is cheaper then ICE. (not counting the price of the car). Less cost per mile and less maintenance. When demand starts to fall be it next year or 5 years from now, Tesla could drop the prices and still have great margins.So how do people put a value on a company? Look 5 years out and discount that back to today. Take the 1.4 million deliveries for 2022 (tesla should end around that number), take the 50% growth for the next 5 years, and take the ave selling price with 30% margin. Discount that back to today to get the projected value of the company. Adjust the numbers down to what you think Tesla will not reach it's goal.That is how people get Tesla at a much higher value. Most ignore profits from everything else. Tesla is growing production rapidly while all the big automakers have been lowering production and having a hard time producing EVs. I will admit, if I did not know everything there is to know on Tesla, I would have gotten scared out of Tesla by now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 15:59:45'] It’s not a car company. It’s a virtual mapping company; digitally mapping the roadways of the entire globe in its database.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 18:41:55'] We’re all going EV. Tesla makes EVs at a superior profit margin than legacy earns on their ICE vehicles. Legacy needs to transition to EVs and not go bankrupt in the process. Legacy will have stranded assets and tons of debt. Tesla just gets bigger and is a self-sustaining cash generating machine. Then if you want you can factor in those other things like FSD, batteries, AI, peaker plants, robots, insurance, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 15:12:35'] What do you mean that it is a car company? Are you trying to compare its PE with a regular car company? If you are doing this, you are going to be so way off.Just to give you first my background, I am an accountant, so here is the perspective from an accountant.Tesla and legacy car companies, the financial structure is heaven and earth so difference, and this is why tesla's value is so much more than a regular car company.1. The value of an EV car company = the future profits MINUS the TOTAL COST OF GETTING RID OF THE OLD ICE CAR BUSINESS. Tesla has a lot of the former, as it is projected that they will be the most profitable car company in the world next year beating out Toyota and VW. They have ZERO of the latter as they do not make non-EV cars.2. Legacy car companies and actually a lot of legacy companies in general from decades ago, they were built differently in terms of capital structure. A lot of these companies have debt, some of them have more than $100B in debt. A quick google and from a July 2020 article, VW has $151B in debt, Toyota $138B, Ford $122B, BMW $114B. How much is Tesla's DEBT? Not even $3B as of June 2022. It is even more crazy that this number is so low as usually one of the valuation metrics that is often looked at is debt to the value of the stock and since Tesla's value is much higher, this metric Tesla just demolishes. This is an IMPORTANT metric especially in the face of a recession as it reflects the risk of the company going bankrupt. This means Tesla has close to zero chance in going bankrupt, while other companies, not so much. If you remember, many of these companies were on the verge of going bankrupt in 2008 before the government saved them. I am  not sure the same treatment will happen if it happens in the future as the world has changed a lot since.3. Supply chain - Tesla has almost a monopoly on the supply chain of EVs, and even in the face of challenges, they are the only car company that is able to put up Tech company- level growth of over 40% consistently in this environment. If you look at the other car companies, other than the EV companies, they all have either sub-10% growth or worse, negative. Growth = higher PE. Longer track record of growth = even higher PE, check out Amazon in the last 20 years. But Tesla also has locked down supply of batteries and has one of the most reliable sources of batteries. Whereas every car company trying to make EV cant seem to get enough of batteries, Tesla can as they have already locked this down years ago.4. The product itself, Tesla;s cars packs a big value even at its price point, before COVID, they grinded down by lowering price as they have also managed to cut significantly the cost of building EVs. VWs CEO has admitted that Tesla basically can build the same car, not only faster than VW, but also cheaper for the same level. You know what this means right? big profits, and ability to churn out more. This mean higher PE.All in all, if you look at Tesla's profit growth, it has been doubling or tripling sometimes. And if you understand how caiptal intensive businesses work, once you past the breakeven point, the profit growth is massive, hence why their profit is growing at like 100%+ even though revenue is only growing 40%+.I have not even talked about labour unions, dealership network, vendor network that is bringing down the value of the other car companies, as that is another long post of its own. As we get into the recession, you will see how reliable Tesla's profitability is going to be, which is why its valuation is it is. You should check out Amazon during the 2008 crisis and years after.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 08:31:48'] P/e steadily dropping, earnings growing like a startup, only profitable ev maker (outside of BYD but no way to know if that’s from hybrid or ev), largest ev capacity, fastest growing capacity, margins like Ferrari and growing, battery production coming at large scale, energy storage and capture business, largest supercharger network worldwide, brand power, customer loyalty rivalling legacy… So much to be bullish on, company and stock price wise. Yea, I think it’s a little inflated, but it’s growing into its valuation very quickly even with the stock growing. Speculative areas, autonomy and robotics. Imo there is a higher likelihood that Tesla gets their FSD to work (once it works, it works everywhere) before anyone else can get it to work somewhere and then scale it worldwide. Teslas data advantage is actually disgusting, and grows by the day. As for robotics, I think they have a great chance at doing something cool, but I don’t even bother thinking about the sex bot. If it dosent work, stock won’t care, if it does the world literally changes forever but it’s insane to even account that into its valuation this early imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 08:50:02'] It trades like a software company with expected higher margins. It’s definitely overvalued by anyones short term measures. I am not sure what people expect honestly, maybe they expect every car on the road to buy into Tesla’s subscription self driving? Idk

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 11:30:48'] Because they are and have been consistently growing ~50% YoY? Because they have incredible brand value despite spending zero on advertising? Because they're the only large scale EV maker in an environment that is quickly ditching ICE? Because they were the only automaker to navigate the semiconductor shortage, proving their anti-fragility? Because they are ALSO in batteries and solar? Because they could ALSO be first to self driving (or not, just a bonus). Because they could be big in robotics?There are many reasons for TSLA to trade at an elevated P/E. But it doesn't make much sense to look at it in a vacuum. Because of their impressive growth the P/E had been steadily dropping, and rather quickly since they became profitable. In a few years I suspect the P/E won't be quick so wild.maybe in the high 30s... Which isn't all that strange for a tech company in a good position... Maybe for an automaker, but that simply isn't the full story. Tesla is one of a kind. At least for now. Most importantly: the other automakers aren't making the same product, just because it also has four wheels. They don't know as much about battery tech, electric motors, software updates etc.

Making large offers to convince them to leave?People holding Tesla like the business, they aren't interested in selling. So you have to pay a lot for it. It's not so much about profit, as it is about how much they love the business. Elon Musk attracts negative attention, but he's a cool innovator, the cars are cool, space-x is cool, the boring company and more are all cool ideas, and he's gets further than almost anyone at making them real, so its exciting to hold tesla.I'm sure there's some theory as to how it could make the money and succeed, but these people just like holding it, and power to those people, I have a few businesses I just think are cool in my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 10:29:57'] You're only missing the fact that it is actually the Meme stock to end all Meme stocks. You can add up all of the valuations of everything that Tesla says they want to be to justify their market cap and they'll still be priced way too high, but none of this matters because it is the cult of Elon. Anyone here who has ever shorted or bought Puts on Tesla has probably learned their lesson. Frankly I don't see why anyone holds TSLA shares anymore after getting these kinds of profits over the years. You're just putting unnecessary risk on your portfolio. Tesla may continue to go up, but at this point consider what has to happen for it to become a $2T or $3T company and whether that risk/upside is worth it against just buying an index. Newsflash, it isn't worth it. Tesla might be escaping scrutiny right now, but at a certain scale they cannot. You're right, they're mainly just a car company at this point, which is a slow growth business, and others are catching up in the EV space. Until they legitimately become more, and those businesses show immense profitability, to me they're just an overblown business. Not a shitco, just valued way too highly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 11:24:22'] okay so this horse has been beaten over and over again, but here goes: You can't just look at a P/E and tell whether a company is fairly valued. You have to look at P/E relative to how fast Earnings are growing. And Tesla's earnings are growing very fast. And it's about to get faster. The CapEx for Austin and Berlin is basically done now. The factories are built and the cash has been spent. Every $50,000 car that comes out of each factory has a gross profit of $15,000. That's $15k in Gross Profit on 1.4M vehicles this year, 2.2M vehicles next year, 3M+ vehicles in 2024, etc, etc. The free cash flow generation of Tesla is WILDLY underestimated (well maybe not because as you said it's holding right in there at a P/E over 50). But my point is that it's deserved. Any dip should be bought. Even if the economy shits itself, Tesla will rebound strong. EVs are the future. Smart Energy storage via battery packs is the future. Self Driving robotaxis are the future. But even if you figure in NONE of those "pie in the sky" revenue estimates, the valuation is still realistic JUST ON THE CURRENT EPS GROWTH FROM 2023 - 2026. There are plenty of people out there who are wayyyy too optimistic. TSLA will not be at $50T by 2030. It won't be at $25T. But hell.. it could easily be a $10T company by the end of the decade if they can just execute their current growth plan. FSD/Robots/BatteryPacks.. those are all just free call options you get for buying the stock today.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 09:25:30'] I think it's just an extended run for a popular stock. It reminds me of Beyond Meat and Shopify which I knew were stupid over-priced but couldn't time it right.Sometimes it's not a matter of buying it's a matter of nobody is selling. I also suspect some creative accounting is going on over there but that's just purely speculation. Either way, it has no business being valued at 875 billion. Add to all that the fact that their quality has been inconsistent, the cars are EXTREMELY basic inside, and that FSD has a ludicrous price tag now and is still in BETA and you have a recipe for a reckoning IMHO. Ultimately, I think it's just going to take a downward catalyst like a severe earnings miss, the Feds suing over the FSD name, a class-action lawsuit since people have paid for FSD and it isn't available and probably won't work with older models... or all of the above.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 13:14:59'] TSLA is very difficult to value. I’d say that TSLA is not just a car company. They got self-driving in the works before any other car company. They have solar and are working on energy solutions. They have a charging network. There’s the SpaceX semi-tie in, which is cool for branding. TSLA’s 10yr CAGR is is substantial. I believe their use of casting to manufacture their cars is cost-cutting (at the very least, it speeds up manufacturing, if I understand correctly). Considering all that growth and tech, a PE of 73 isn’t insane IMHO (although TSLA will have to continue executing well to justify that valuation). If the PE goes down to 50 or so, all the better.

There are a million variables that the tech needs to know and no other company is close to having that amount of data.   While there are downsides to EV's, they are\\will be superior to ICE in many ways. The people and news media corps that say otherwise are likely heavily invested in oil and so try to focus on the negatives- which there are.I would say see if you could rent a tesla for a week and use it as your daily driver.

The only exception being that the company needs to have at least enough money to stay out of bankruptcy. But even that doesn’t matter anymore, since the closer a company is to bankruptcy, the more shorts pile on hoping to make free money, which draws the attention of meme stock degenerates who keep highshortinterest.com bookmarked in search of an early entry point on the next pump and dump they can bill as a “squeeze play”Now If stocks still issued healthy dividends, then the health of the company would matter, since you have to have profits to sustain and grow dividends.

PE is so outdated and doesn’t tell the whole story. That being said nobody knows if it’s under or over valued. Opinions and only time will tell

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 15:27:46'] I think you’re mistaken in thinking that Tesla is a car company. When thinking about the valuation of Tesla, it’s very important to recognize the data aspect of it. Plain and simple, Tesla in and of itself is a technology company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 16:02:59'] Do people really think the price of a stock is tied to their performance? Its value comes from the desire of people to buy it, similar to crypto. It has nothing to do with the underlying value because holding it doesn’t give you voting rights, dividends, income, or anything at all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 16:15:21'] I'm getting a little tired of trying to explain this using projections, numbers, analysis, etc., only to receive "whatever, it's still overvalued" with no arguments or simply no reply from the person you replied to at all.But since you seem to be genuinely trying to understand, I'll add some more numbers-based analyses that will hopefully show you that Tesla is far from overvalued.First off, let's look at some short term numbers. Tesla in H1 2022 has sold ~550K cars, at ASPs of $57K and a net operating margin of ~17%. On top of that they had some other earnings, but let's ignore that for now. This adds up to ~$5.3B in net income.For H2, Shanghai was recently upgraded and is now producing ~85K cars a month after producing ~120K in July+August. Fremont will probably increase Model S/X production a bit, and otherwise stay the same at ~150K per quarter. Giga Berlin and Texas averaged out at about 1K units per week by the end of Q2. They are both slowly ramping up towards 5K per week by the end of the year, so let's average that out at 3K per week.Adding all of those up, they should be delivering ~838K cars in H2. ASPs will increase a bit, since the latest price increases did not hit sales yet due to the long order backlog, so let's estimate ~$58K. Margins should be increasing too, since Shanghai is a lot more profitable than Fremont and will grow from ~50% of total production to ~65% of total production, so let's low ball it at 21% operating income.Using all of those numbers, H2 should be around $10.2B, with total earnings in 2022 coming in at $15.5B. With the current market cap of around $900B, that's a PE of 58 with earnings growing ~182%. That leads to a PEG ratio of 0.32 when 2-3 is normal for large caps. Now naturally Tesla is still quite early into its profitability, so earnings growth will come down over time, but at least in the short term, Tesla is quite cheaply valued.Looking a bit further out, you can use my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) to see how even at a $1T market cap, Tesla's on course towards a PE of between 15 and 31. Since that post, Tesla had some pretty big headwinds with the China factory shutdown, but 2023/2024 remain unchanged. I don't believe that those kinds of PEs have ever happened for a company growing earnings at ~50% a year, especially a large cap. Nor would a PEG of 0.3-0.6 make sense. So safe to say even in the mid term, through 2024, Tesla's stock is very cheap and will need to go up significantly before we get there.Now of course looking out even further, you get into FSD, Tesla Bot, Energy, compact car, Autobidder, etc. territory. I've done plenty of research to be confident that many if not all of those products will become successful as well, and that people will look back at the "Tesla is just a car company" argument with complete disbelief in 5-10 years. But even if you don't believe any of that, and you don't want to look more than 3 years out into the future, I believe my numbers above show how Tesla is a huge bargain right now and has at least 100% upside between now and the end of 2024.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 17:55:19'] It’s not a car company it’s a tech company. If I remember correctly they get “government contracts” because they use clean energy. Since all their cars are electric they get a lot of those contracts. Other car companies buy some of those contracts from tesla so they can off set some of the “dirty energy” they use. I might not be totally correct but that’s a rough summary lol.And also the worth of a stock is more of what the public perceive it to be rather than what it’s actually worth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 18:08:51'] It is valued for 45% per year growth. As long as the earnings grow at 45% there is absolutely nothing wrong with these valuations.🤔

The future will be BEVs , just how long does it take to adapt.Solar portion of the company is so so, but not worth ignoringBattery storage grid portion will be pretty huge as renewables become more prevalent the need to store and help soften demand/supply spikes will be needed. They have software called auto bidder if you want to read more about it.Some of the far out things that could make Tesla 100x in a short time would be completing FSD and successful AI robots doing manual labor. I don't bet a huge amount on these, but def possibilities. I see fsd in less than 10 years, probably less than 5. AI robots? Who knows.As a mainly car/energy company I see Tesla at least 3x in 5-7 yearsThe auto industry has been stagnant with little or no innovation for decades, Tesla is shaking the hell out of it and making crazy money doing so. They will be less affected by fed rate increases also as they are carrying nearly no debt at all. Their cash reserve now I think is 10-15b, will be well over 20 after q3.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 19:10:58'] the bull case is revenue and earnings grew 50% annually on average for the last 5 years. so while PE is 100 now, it could be 50-75 PE next year at current levels. It could be 35-50 PE in two years.  so that's why PE stays around 100 but the stock keeps going up. because the market is pricing in a few good years of 50% revenue and EPS growth annually. what other large cap company has this type of growth now?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 19:11:49'] I think the biggest debate is the profit margin.  If Tesla can just make 3 times more profit per car than toyota, and sell 10 million cars, it price kind of make sense. The bulls would tell you Tesla can continue selling it's car at a premium price.  I don't know if that's true.  Another debate is the possibility of robotaxi.  Me personally I think Tesla price is too high but not entirely "impossible" to make sense.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 20:41:15'] I don't own TSLA nor did I buy the car.  One phenomenon is 'virtue signaling', the  idea that as a driver you are helping the Earth.  In fact, in places like where I am in eastern MA, 52% of electricity is generated by burning something.  So not nearly as virtuous as most buyers would believe.  However, I do find EV owners I have talked to ready to discuss and learn the downsides and misconceptions.I personally believe that competition will have a hard time, but it is certain that competition will sink Tesla's stock eventually.At TSLA stock's height several months ago it was worth more then J&J.  Tesla has say 3 businesses, while J&J has 63 businesses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 21:19:33'] Great publicity (no publicity is bad publicity) and lot of very bullish prospectors, or rather, fanboys. For the most part, Musk has been and still is making things happen, but growth is not unlimited, and competition does exist. tl;dr there is a crowd of investors who are a lot more convinced/faithful in the company's growth potential than what may be reasonable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 22:16:38'] I'm not a Tesla bull, I think it's way over priced for a proof of profit but just look at how much a $1,000 phone dictates our purchasing decisions. What do you think a $60,000 car can influence if set up properly into an ecosystem. The thing with Tesla is they are trying to do to cars what Apple/iPhone did with cellphones. And individual sell was great for phone manufacturers before and they currently are for cars. But if you can build an ecosystem you can lock in future dominance instead of decades of constant changing. No car manufacturer has come close to the dominance Apple has had with the iPhone ecosystem over 20 years. If they pull that off they will be worth a lot more than AAPL is. But who knows to what degree they can possibly come close.

Their back order amounts are staggering.Tesla isn’t hype Tesla is the future. Guess what other automakers are doing since Tesla’s inception? Making EV’s.Teslas valuations as of now actually aren’t that bad. When looking at teslas P/E ratio you have to look at it in relation to its earnings which like it’s revenues are massive.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 13:00:39'] TESLA has major up swing potential with it's other products that are not it's cars. If you remove the car equation you'll see that their tech is VERY far ahead of their competition. They have a better more reliable electric car charging network than electrify America. They are also in talks about opening up their network to other car manufacturers. Their auto pilot experiences far less issues than all other manufacturers combined. And I'm not talking about their full self driving. They have a subscription model for it and could expand it out to the other car manufacturers. They will soon be a major battery manufacturer contender. There are talks about their cars connecting to starlink. Which gives them a major edge of general lte and dead zones. They can basically subscription sell each part of their business to all other car manufacturers. Which I believe would be their end goal. You would buy a Tesla car just like how someone buys a pixel phone. So that you can be first for the updates. And not their build quality.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 10:14:02'] Its a big risk big reward stock.If self driving is a reality, it worth 3 trillion. If no self driving and competition catches up with EV, then its worth less than 100 billion.

While I agree that they primarily sell cars to the public, they are a data collection company.  I agree that the cost of the stock is outlandish; however, the data they are collecting is worth, dare I say...Billions.  I have no position in Tesla but watch the stock and the numbers the stock has hit has me like 'wow'.I can't say where it will go, but my best guess is that if the markets stay together and the bears retreat back to their dens the Bulls will return on TESLA's potential.

Their tech is just better.Not to mention self driving (my Model S Performance just got FULL SELF DRIVING) activated and while I was happy with regular old autopilot, this is incredible.So there's more to it. But it's still silly expensive. You ned 10 straight years of flawless execution and margin protection to get to this being a reasonable valuation. Hard to do.Microsoft was 69x earnings in 2000.  It crashed to 8x earnings. For the 22 year period since 2000, they've executed beautifully but not flawlessly.Your 13 year return had you bought in 2000 was around 6.5% compounded to this year.  Incidentally AAA treasury bonds were yielding about 6.5% back then too.

If this is true, I expect the stock to pump higher till the earnings are out and then sell off
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 13:50:58'] Autonomous driving is a marketing gimmick at this point and pretty much the main argument for their stupid valuation from the get go. When this was apparent to be no where close to completion there has been a goal post shifting focusing on margins per car, car sales etc...

Couple that with very passionate share holders and it's just hard for the stock to go down unless the narrative around the company fundamentally changes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 18:50:47'] The justice department did this in adjunct to NHTSA's investigation last year, if there was an Injunction to halt Tesla's FSD, Autopilot. they would have done it already. And through NHTSA's own engineering review would've raised red flags very early and would have requested the Justice Department force Tesla to stop Autopilot if Tesla didn't comply with a non-judicial request. Why focus on Autopilot, all the other lane keeping stuff out there is crap, while Autopilot gets pretty shitty around exit merge lanes/cones/construction, so do all the other manufacturers "Autopilot" competitors that also feature lane keeping and stop and go traffic following.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 02:10:37'] Did Tesla mislead people or did people purposely abuse the system by not paying attention and being unattentive at the steering wheel. How can AI crash if it’s actions are constantly monitored by the supposed attentive driver. It’s not gonna do some random direction change in an instant so everything should be easily avoidable. The excuse is only made when people crash their teslas and don’t want to say they were distracted or texting. Most car crashes are human error and avoidable statistically speaking. The software is statistically more accurate than a human driver it’s stupid to blame the software when it’s abused by the drivers. The law requires attentive driving to use autopilot and if you are paying attention the auto pilot will never crash as you can intervene incase for some very unlikely reason it makes a faulty decision.

POST_TEXT: b'https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/02/tesla-ev-deliveries-fall-nearly-18-in-second-quarter-following-china-factory-shutdown/\n\nTesla delivered 254,695 electric vehicles globally in the second quarter, a nearly 18% drop from the previous period as supply chain constraints, Chinas extended COVID-19 lockdown and challenges around opening factories in Berlin and Austin took their toll on the company. This is the first time in two years that Tesla deliveries, which were 310,048 in the first period this year, have fallen quarter over quarter. Tesla deliveries were up 26.5% from the second quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter reduction is in line with a broader supply chain problem in the industry. It also illustrates the importance of Teslas Shanghai factory to its business. Tesla shuttered its Shanghai factory multiple times in March due to rising COVID-19 cases that prompted a government shutdown.\n\nThe company said Saturday it produced 258,580 EVs, a 15% reduction from the previous qua'

Sounds to me like the two new factories (Texas, Germany) are starting to ramp up and reduce their dependence on China and California.  Sucks that covid impacted, but they're not the only one who has been hit by issues over the last 2 years and those numbers are proof they're diversifying their output successfully.Ideally there would be no external impacts, but here in the real world it seems like an OK quarter provided the next returns to the projected outputs

I think it is still so.  At that time TSLA market cap was about $1.1 Trillion.  And as of right now it is about $644 billion.  Of course some of this is to the macro environment: inflation, higher interest rates, etc.  But some has to do with market not knowing the next 1 to 3 years of Tesla revenue/earnings.   I still think the appetite for expensive cars is fairly finite.  However, what I didn’t anticipate was the IRA: I think this will help Tesla quite a bit.  If Tesla vehicles qualify: it will reduce the cost quite a bit and so demand in the USA will probably not be an issue.  I will address some points as I did 1 year ago:1) USA: as above: Tesla won’t have issues here: it is just a matter of how much production they can do in Fremont and Austin.  ~~The expensive model y and 3 will be less expensive if they indeed qualify for the whole $7500 credit (because there is some battery component issue??~~  (I am not a tax advisor so please ask tax advisor if Tesla qualifies for $7500 credit or not).  ~~So this is a change of my view.~~  I do still believe people will still buy the Rav-4, CR-V, etc…Also, there is a little more competition with the Mach E and soon made in Tennessee ID4…however, this does kinda’ gets cancelled out by the Ioniq5/EV6 that won’t qualify for the tax credit so the sales of those will decline.  Bolt, Lightning, Rivian, Lucid: they are not going to produce in enough numbers to take away sales from Tesla.  2)  China: Ok, this is where the issue lies.  The competition is more fierce this year than last year.  Moreso than I had originally thought.  I know many people think that some of these Chinese companies sell a bunch of these EV and not make money: that is true in some; but the giant bear in china is BYD: they will report an $800-$900 million profit in Q3 2022.  Why is this important?  They are able to sell relatively cheaper cars and still be profitable.  The cars that are going to give Tesla some headaches are: BYD Seal and the upcoming BYD sea lion.  The seal has good range, 0-100 km/hr time, and have a lower price than model 3.  Unlike in the USA: people in China have more choices and will cross shop. In the USA:  we can’t cross shop with model 3; and even with model y: the main competitors are: mach E, ID4, but they aren’t all produced in high numbers yet (EV6/ioniq 5 won’t qualify for tax credit right now so I don’t think it is going to compete much).  However in China: there is a lot of production from not just BYD, but also Xpeng, Nio, and many more others.  3)  Europe: This is a mix bag. Berlin just started.  There is more competition here than before: moreso than USA, but less than China.  Cars such as Renault Megane didn’t exist 1 year ago.  VW, Stellantis, RMN, BMW are still steady with their EV sales.   For Tesla: UK and Germany is still selling Tesla quite well.  But for whatever reason France and Norway: there is some decline in sales Y-O-Y.  Berlin ramping up will answer the question to the demand in France and Norway.  Netherlands: still hasn’t recovered much.  So the biggest market right now for Europe is UK and Germany.   Electric car incentive will decrease in Germany in 2023: I don’t know how much effect it will have?? 4) Cybertruck: still not out yet.  But this will be a North American vehicle. Too big for Europe5) So if china demand slows down: tesla can certainly export to other markets: but the other markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (the richest countries in Asia-Australia):  I don’t think the market for Tesla will be as high as Europe.  6) Market Cap of $644 billion today (was $1.1 trillion 1 year ago):  TSLA will have to gain 70% to get back to 1.1 trillion.  What is the difference then and now?  Then: a lot of low interest money: remember all those SPACS??  ARKK?  A lot of market exuberance and many companies didn’t trade on fundamentals.   So at today’s market cap: if tesla just grows 10% per year in market cap, TSLA be $1.3 trillion in 7 years. And in 7 years the PE will probably be 25.  That is net income of $52 billion per year.  For a car company: this is difficult.   I think all profits combined in all automotive sector ex-tesla is < $50 billion today (this is just a guess: Toyota + VW is about $30 billion)??  Last year I wrote: “at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap. To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???”---This year,  the question is will TSLA make $13 billion/quarter in 7 years????7)  Again, I will reiterate that capitalism has a way for a product to find the lowest price with a given quality.  Competition creeps up slowly.  Feds have been tightening money supply with higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates and probable upcoming recession may have some effect on Tesla overall sales.  Time will tell.   8)  I think 2023 will be the year that we will have a lot more answers to many questions: what is the intrinsic demand in Europe/is the demand really softened in France and Norway? Is the demand slowed down in China?  Also, will Tesla cut prices in China (this will affect margins)?  To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?   As of right now, there hasn’t been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory. 9) My opinion: USA: demand won’t be an issue.  China: demand will soften. Europe: demand will soften but less so than China.  I am excited to see what 2023 brings to Tesla.Edit: I am really unsure if tesla model y and 3 will qualify for tax credit or not (so I struck that out above).   Regardless, I don't think Tesla will have much demand problem in the USA: mainly due to not enough competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 05:55:43'] The problem I see with this analysis is that it primarily takes past data and extrapolates that, assuming Tesla will be able to sell everything it makes and at similar margins.  It doesn't take into account competition, TAM by segment, etc.Most of Tesla's sales are Model 3 and Model Y, which are its lowest-priced cars but still quite expensive.  Is there enough market--even accounting for increased popularity of Evs--for Tesla sales to grow that much and still maintain their margins?  That is the analysis I'd like to see.  I am not sure of prices elsewhere, but the cheaper EVs here in Canada like the IONIQ 5 are around $15K cheaper than a Tesla (mid 40K range compared to Tesla low 60K range).  That makes a Tesla about 30% more expensive to buy which is pretty big.  As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.So one would expect either Tesla's sales to peak as they (and oncoming competition) saturate their market at that price level, or else Tesla needs to start selling a whole lot of cheaper cars which means either serious margin reductions or else cutting costs significantly to keep their margins.Anyway the demand side including what the competition is doing is what I really want to see in a Tesla analysis. Just asserting that they can sell everything they make and at the same margins for a higher-priced product would need a lot of backing to that argument no matter the industry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 22:27:51'] OP, your post is impressive, but you could be right about everything in terms of Tesla's business and the stock could still not go up accordingly due to macro events outside of Tesla's control. (Rising interest rates, etc)And Tesla stock has shown to be very, very sensitive to macro events.Long-term I'm ultra bullish on Tesla but bearish on Tesla and other similar hot stocks like NVIDIA etc until the Fed pivots or stops raising interest rates.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 02:10:05'] I think it will be more and more complicated for tesla to continue at this rate.More and more competitors in the sector. Loss of leadership in autonomous driving.Lack of quality after-sales service.The design of the cars that were revolutionary at the time are clearly not revolutionary anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 08:26:08'] Honestly I don’t like my Model Y. I am already waiting for my next car. It’s hard for me to get into this stock now. Really wanted to like this car but its just messed up. It costs as much as an luxury EV but looking nothing like it. I only bought one because there was no good alternative, now having pre-paid for an alternative I cannot wait to get ride of it. When more alternatives flood market tesla is going to have a hard time even meeting the bear case here
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 05:00:14'] What a sloppy analysis. Reddit is full of anecdotal posts that the competition is coming! Did you not see how BYD totally outsold Tesla in Kazakhstan? Did you also not see the panel gap that can fit your mama?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 13:50:49'] Ahhh yes Tesla has an endless well of buyers that can't afford luxury cars today to dip into, to buy shoddily made cars at luxury prices tomorrow, while growing energy costs and a struggling power grid ensure major issues for actually powering all of these new EVs regardless of make.  This is aside from the fact that many potential buyers are now never going to purchase a Tesla due to Elon showing his ass far too often.  Furthermore completely ignoring that car sales are cyclical and that Tesla has not put out an affordable car, a car that can truly fit a large family or a truck.  And before you say shit about the CyberTruck, let's acknowledge it will be at least 80k and will have the same problem as all EVs, suck at towing, so it is not a truck for 50% of the truck market all while being too expensive for many of those who pre-ordered.Meanwhile the whole auto industry is on the verge of a massive disruption from Repos, interest rates curbing demand right as inventory picks up.  But hey, everything is fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 05:26:55'] This all may be true, but including the futures TSLA is almost 50% down from ATH. The S&P is nowhere near that drop in the long run TSLA will not beat the market, there are plenty of examples from the last 100 years. The problem becomes when to sell it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 08:42:59'] It's odd that you're looking at demand like it's infinite - they actually have to sell the cars they produce.  I'm seeing increasing customer service and quality issues that I'm betting will curb demand.  The mainstream doesn't want a buggy product.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 14:44:11'] Here is the thing. If it hit 160, chances are there is an underlining reason it hit that and you likely would have hesitations at that price based on the new information that resulted in such a drop. No one suggests Tesla is not a successful company now. A great number of people are questioning the valuation. There is a difference and alot of investors can not understand that.

This is without touching on everything else Tesla is involved in. Other auto companies will not be able to mass produce EVs to meet the insane demand. Even if they do take a bite of Tesla’s pie, they will not be able to do it with margins as high as Tesla’s.This is the reason that the stock is priced accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 07:56:55'] Taleb interviewing with Tom Keene right now.  Guy is always on a barbell port with tail risk puts, so take it with a grain of salt but he's saying something I'm hearing more and more.  We need a culture change where society expects managing money to be our main job and our main job secondary when it should be the reverse.  The purpose of money management is to preserve wealth first and foremost from our productive hard work, not moving money around.There's too many really smart people, especially young, focused on either managing their money or others rather than creating something of value for society.  According to him, the problem is that the there's a constant battle between the prudent and the "winners" who are foolish risktakers that eventually blow up but are constantly replaced by a new crop that want to perpetuate this culture.Edit: to add further onto this, I believe an overly accommodative Fed for last several decades have massively made this problem worse.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 10:10:10'] Read an interesting article on some surprising reasons why oil is down. One of the reasons is interest rates, but not just in the way you think (i.e. less demand). There are some countries/companies that are choosing the sell their oil right away (instead of storing it) because they can currently get 4% return on their cash. Another is that the Saudi's have been cutting production, but they tend to produce a more sulfurous / sour oil. The US and Brazil are "making up" for their cuts with actual "sweet" crude, which is easier to refine.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:13:12'] didn't he make this accusation like 3 months ago? with leaked text messages?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 21:12:14'] Bill must be making money then
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 21:01:48'] “More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians” sorry, who bankrolls politicians?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:17:25'] Gates must be licking his chops since the beginning of the whole Twitter saga.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:42:09'] Ah yes, another Musk trolling for the books. This time pumping his share price knowing gullible retail will immediately go "lets start a short squeeze and bankrupt bill gates"
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 00:55:15'] And another meaningless "Elon Musk says..." thread. Seems like an annoying daily ritual right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:46:01'] Just my opinion, but I think the way elon handled the twitter deal is just bad business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:48:17'] Unpopular opinion here but I’m almost certain bill gates is more knowledgeable than Elon musk, he has seen a thing of two.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:42:31'] thought I was on WSB with how apey some of these comments are
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 22:56:18'] Is there a way I can filter out posts with Elon Musk in the title of reddit threads? I'm getting tired of seeing Elon Musk's name on a daily basis now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 02:54:43'] It's funny how fake this story is. And how much everyone wants to speculate about gains/losses on a position that most likely doesn't exist. And even if it does. No one has any clue when it was opened. There is no way, that Gates manages his own money. And there is no way that he's throwing half a billion dollar positions around into unlimited loss scenarios. Unless his money manager was Bill Hwang
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:54:54'] Rich people go short/bearish A LOT. Not just the Bill Ackman types and the Bill Gates types, but the CEOs and other C-levels. They’re really good at figuring out when to cash out long positions and take on short positions.Look at a website like OpenInsider that tracks insider trades and you’ll see EVERYONE at the ARKK companies and beyond had been selling their stock in TDOC, ZS, DIS, VZ, SPCE, probably TSLA too. It’s common sense that TSLA has no business at $1000+ but it’s a pump so people want to ride the wave and try to make some quick and easy money. Problem is most people got on the wave too late and then rode it back down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 00:57:56'] Im old enough to remember when bill gates was the evil overlord everyone hated. Great to see his morph on internet culture to an anti hero with elons heel turn nowSwear to god. People here talk less and less about stocks and more and more about shitty drama
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:35:17'] I trust bill gate more than musk with all the recent pump and dump games he been playing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:45:00'] Elon Musk says a lot of things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 23:27:42'] Can't we get a single month without Elon news?    This guy is a huge attention whore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 23:58:30'] Elon is trying to insinuate that TSLA is a meme stock that his mere mentioning of can boost price by 35%, like he's done with other assets many times before.Pump and dump king? Perhaps. Does he want apes to pay attention to him? Definitely.I think a lot of people have learned his game by now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 22:18:34'] Elon is so salty that he's even spreading vaccine conspiracy theories against Bill Gates. He recently posted on Twitter about Gates "wait till you find out what he's put into the Vaccines". This guy has small dick energy
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:27:43'] Musk leading up to 2022 = Gold.Musk since 1/1/2022 = Train wreck.His story is now playing out like the classic 'spoiled rich kid'.  The day he tweeted out his 'twitter offer deal/no-deal' was the height of arrogance.  Normal business/respect be damned.  Those things are for the peasants.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:46:16'] We don't really have any context about it. A multi billion dollar short could also mean he has a multi billion dollar long position that he's hedging during volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:02:27'] What a fucked up thing for a CEO to publicly announce.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 15:29:43'] I don’t trust politicians and I don’t trust Elon. He carelessly manipulates stocks and crypto with tweets. There’s no doubt he has made money off these tweets while others have lost. He is no different than a politician, he’s just more eccentric.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:57:21'] Lmao 75% said they trusted politicians less than billionaires even though it is the mega wealthy who stop democracy from functioning properly in the first place. Why not tackle the problem at the roots rather than trimming the branches.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:46:20'] Isn’t it more like Bill Gates family office is short Tesla. It’s not like Gates is managing his own investments. Also they have over $70 billion AUM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:08:05'] Its a great short.  Massively overvalued ran by a moron who is now having a mental breakdown as he alienates his entire customer base.It's like free money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 23:24:05'] Screw Tesla.  To all the Musk drones, he's a prick, has decided to go full political, his cars are having tons of issues while constantly still manipulating crap, like he is with Twitter, I'm done with him.  At least Bill donates a ton to charities and does good things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 00:28:19'] Only 500 million??

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:03:05'] Gates played Musk like a fiddle. His billionaire boner isn’t as big anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:04:01'] Elon is off his meds again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:18:23'] Fuck Elon musk. Fat piece of shit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 09:26:08'] Musk needs to stfu and focus on his companies. Trolling everyone on Twitter like a teenager is not working for him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:07:41'] Yeah this is old news
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 14:53:49'] WHO CARES. Fucking fed up of daily Elon news. Guys a prick.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:48:17'] “Hold my beer”-Ken Griffin
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 22:35:16'] Musk should go after the Koch brothers for buying half of Congress. And Buffett for killing rooftop solar. So many billionaires who are attacking renewables. Maybe Musk can figure out why we don't like them.Look at Amazon. Bezos could be spending billions on renewables or developing batteries and taking over that entire ecosystem.If Bezos was asking for a loan for battery factories or lobbying for lithium mines I would say most Americans would respect that more than space vanity projects.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 22:58:28'] Good. Short that pig to the ground Bill!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:16:28'] Bill Gates already knows what will happen in the future... Musk should want Gates to be shorting Tesla, so that it squeezes up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 21:41:29'] Incredible how disconnected a stock can get from reality if the SEC doesn’t protect investors. Right now they’re all cheering but when tesla inevitably crashes to 200bn, Tesla cultists can thank the SEC for allowing musk to pump the stock to 1.2 trillion based on lies, sell at the top (one last time, too many)  and leave fanboys hodling the bag. Basically the only reason it is as high as it is isn’t because of what’s in the pipeline but what musk gets away with.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 03:48:34'] Musk puts out a poll asking his fan base if they trust him or politicians less. Gee whiz I wonder what the results could have possibly been
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 00:30:39'] Bill is a good investor
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:33:20'] Elon is crazy so it’s a good position to have.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 02:09:27'] Tesla’s value and price do not line up to its revenue. Its practically gravity that bill gates is betting on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 02:32:39'] Chad Bill Gates
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 22:29:21'] Which means that Gates has made more money on Tesla this year than Musk has.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 02:14:10'] Fuck Bill Gates
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:12:13'] Elon is pumping the stock so he can sell at a high to cover the 6 billion or whatever it was he is pulling off margin. He knows he can get enough anti Gates people to pump the value on tweets like this. Anyone that thinks he doesn’t have some sort of 4-D chess move going on nearly every tweet is living in a fantasy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 19:25:15'] Wow I didn't know this many people HATED Musk. To you all he seems to have started 3 different billion dollar companies, worked on landing rockets and kick-starting the ev industry. I honestly don't get it, to say he didn't start Tesla because the original guys had a prototype that they lost money on for every sale.........wtf is happening???? Am I taking crazy pills or was everyone here short in 2020

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:00:38'] How come someone who is so keen on sustainable energy massively shorting a company that is trying to do exactly that?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:31:44'] The anti musk comments in here are weird. Pretty sure they are bots.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 20:39:14'] Let's buy more tesla and ruin Gates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 23:26:20'] What caused the beef between gates and musk in the first place. You would think a gung ho environmentalist like Gates would support Musk and Tesla not stand in opposition to him. My guess is there some behind a scene billionaire spat and what we're seeing is nothing but a dick slapping contest between billionaires.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:28:04'] Didn’t Bill Hates have an AMA session on Reddit a couple of weeks ago? He was asked about this position many times, and I think he denied it. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 21:51:14'] Is this the same instance that was mentioned months ago or did musk say it again?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 23:47:44'] I will never make the list for Mars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 01:17:53'] Most of these positions are being reported way too late to follow. Also they are probably well hedged and we don't know when they were actually closed. Also, don't forget that many shorts against Must have been destroyed in the past. My only concern is that now we are dealing with Gates who is many levels up than most of the other funds that have been trying to short Tesla all these years. &#x200B;Finally, from a personal perspective I do not hold positions for months, just for a few days or weeks, and I'm not invested in TESLA but I'm actually looking for a long position (again) next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 02:18:46'] Be like Billy the (O) G
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 03:10:41'] The answer to musk’s question about polls should have been, “Depends on the politician.  And, Elon, it depends on the billionaire.”

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 03:34:19'] The CEO every shareholder dreams of, that obsessed about the share price and juices it
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:02:19'] I have zero trust in billionaires so having less trust in politicians is kind of meaningless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:15:14'] \> Musk was replying to tweets after the close of his Twitter poll asking who respondents trust less -- politicians or billionaires. More than 75% said they had less trust in politicians.&#x200B;Wow, what a shock. People who follow Elon Musk and answers his polls are definitely not supporters of Musk... What a fucking clown that guy is, jesus christ
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:49:11'] Probably when it was around $950. I was sorely tempted then, but what I’ve been doing in the market has been working well & I didn’t want to blow it on a new thing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:49:50'] Just because we trust politicians less doesn’t mean we fucking trust billionaires. But they’ll never see it that way of course.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:49:52'] It’s sad how we get sucked up into billionaire worship. First everyone was swinging on gate’s nuts back on the 80’s. Everyone loved him because he was the messiah of business and the Clinton’s tried to break up windows but he beat them. Jobs was a hippie pariah and conservatives hated him but when apple made them millions of $ in their portfolio they started wearing iPhone on their belts under their fat guts and swinging on his nuts. Now it’s now they’re all deep throating Musk because of all the money Tesla has made them.  It’s really entertaining to watch. I don’t trust either of them. If locking is all in Covid camps like in China and forcing us to work 60 hour work weeks for $5 per hour would make TESLA price go up;  guess who would be all for it!!   I don’t trust either.  It’s all smoke and mirrors for idiots.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:55:23'] Good on bill. The price went from 1.2k to 650
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:58:36'] Seems like a great way for Gates to make A LOT of money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:09:32'] Well since Tesla is down like 40% from ATH I’ll bet Bill is happy about that?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:23:46'] >at what price did Bill Gates short tesla shares?We don't know that he did.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:40:48'] Elon is addicted to Twitter likes
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:53:54'] Well Bill has time on his side.  In couple of years when all automakers catch up with Tesla, the price will come to earth and Bill will laugh his way to Bank.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:57:18'] Why would he even be talking about this, what a prick
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:59:00'] He posted screenshots like a while ago but okay
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:04:24'] How great would it be all these years of gates being the richest just to loose it all after his divorce and be broke because of a short .
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:13:20'] Good for Bill Gates. He's a smart guy and TSLA is way overpriced.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:14:19'] Gates is a terrible investor. Seems like he would have figured this out by now. Not likely to run out of money though. Has recently had a huge position in caterpillar, would be hard to find much of a worse stock then that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:15:22'] If say it's smart ... I predict all major stocks will be down 10-15% by the end of the year

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:36:04'] Unfortunately I don't believe anything Musk has to sayI am pretty sure gates is up on his short, Musk is trying to poke a bear
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:38:35'] Oh look, the fragile, misogynist, racist, childish, lying "businessman" is accusing another successful billionaire of... *checks notes* playing him like a fool?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:44:03'] What's the difference the politicians are just tools for the billionaires, citizens united broke democracy
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:53:24'] I hope he ends up owning a big portion of Tesla too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:59:51'] Ah huh... And only Mollusk and his crooked dick is the only one that knows about it, why?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:02:38'] even if true, what musk still has not learned is;    gates is being lawful by not commenting at all,  musk is breaking security regs talking about it.  clearly musk lacks the self control  needed  to own a social media or publishing entity.  we may love his tweets,  but they take on   a new meaning if he'll owns the platform.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 05:47:27'] The question is when exactly. Because if he rode it down from 1200 to 880 he banked big time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 11:11:39'] I find it disingenous to argue that shorting Tesla means you want them to go bankrupt.You can think Tesla is a great company with a good mission and still think their stock is obscenely overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 08:02:34'] I don't know if you can say that Tesla is the company "doing the most to solve climate change."  At the end of the day, they're still producing and selling automobiles designed for individual/small group use.   Even if their car life-cycle, from minerals in the Earth to the last day of car ownership, has less of an impact that gas-powered cars, that's a pretty low bar to step over.   It's not like Tesla is aiming to replace cars with say, bikes, mass transportation, or even video-conferencing. It's fair to say that Zoom, Trek and Piaggio have done far more for climate change than Tesla has. Maybe even Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 08:17:26'] This Is just about the least convincing thing I've ever seen
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 06:27:42'] So, no dates on the texts probably indicates this didn't happen recently. They were intentionally taken immediately after. Also. I would be very skeptical about a random text thread that "supposedly" between two elites, as if it was true this would probably not hit the media without someone getting smacked with a civil suit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 06:58:15'] Wow this post really brought in the Q cult.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 07:31:38'] Gates doesn't manage his own investments. I doubt he knows the details of all the positions cascade owns. This feels fake

What a petty & selfish guy Elon is! Also, folks, please be aware that Gates has such a vast portfolio which he does not manage himself like we peasants have to manage (our own measly portfolios). He has a team of portfolio managers who make these decisions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 17:20:41'] Let me get this straight. Elon wants to buy Twitter to ensure free speech is preserved.Elon proceeds to confirm an unverifiable claim from screenshots of texts, posted by a 3rd party, EV proponent/stand up comedian Twitter account (which is biased towards Elon, of course because that’s also what he is).Followers of Elon, the general public, mostly start ragging on Bill Gates for supposedly standing against EV. And this is the preservation of free speech? This is the equivalent of high school rumours
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 06:06:29'] Elon musk is a douchebag
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 09:51:34'] Gates told NYT opinion writer Kara Swisher last year: “It’s important to say that what Elon did with Tesla is one of the greatest contributions to climate change anyone’s ever made. And you know, underestimating Elon is not a good idea.”
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 16:45:23'] Claims to be adamantly in favor of "the spirit of free speech". Refuses to do philanthropy because he doesn't like someones stock ownership choices. I wonder if Elon Mush is just another rich douchebag manipulating people to get what he wants.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 09:19:52'] Is it confirmed that gates is on some robinhoodesque app buying puts? I'd like to imagine he has a wealth manager on a payroll.

Last quarter they reported supply chain shortages, then covid shutdowns in China and no new tesla models, plus raising prices, and all his battery energy projects are shrinking not growing.  So is this just creative accounting?  I know fork many years Amazon was able to get by without posting any taxable profits, but then whenever they wanted profits to brag about they created them.  So I wonder if TSLA has a SEC problems for more than just  Musk's tweets and false promises,

POST_TEXT: b"Sorry for my ignorance, I feel I lived under a rock not knowing who Elon Musk or Tesla was entirely until much later than most. I was wondering was Tesla's IPO well-known?\n\nIs this something investors were talking about since day 1, or did it fly under the radar unconsidered until much later on? Thanks in advanced!"
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 00:24:19'] Well, they raised about 220 million dollars at IPO (in 2010). If you factor in the 15:1 stock splits we've had so far that would be 1.13$-ish per share. There was some media stuff about it since Tesla was the first auto manufacturer to go public in....forever, but I don't think a lot of regular people beyond the eco-crowd saw this as something to invest in - much less count on as making a huge profit some time down the road.(Heck, I dumped some money into Tesla in 2019 and I didn't do it for profits - I just didn't want to see the company fail. I was aware of Tesla before then but Roadster/Model S and Model X were 'toys for the rich' so I didn't give the company much thought until they brought out the Model 3)Toyota held 50mn $ worth (of the roughly 225mn dollars raised during IPO) and I think Mercedes still owned a healthy chunk of Tesla at the time (also around 50mn $ IIRC?). Both must be kicking themselves that they eventually sold (I think Mercedes sold their share for 500mn $). That 50mn stock package back then would now be worth about 5bn$ today.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 07:05:15'] No, in the early days of Tesla going public they were constantly teetering on going bankrupt. Even Elon said they could possibly go out of business. The main sentiment was they would run out of money and declare bankruptcy eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 07:18:12'] Tesla’s IPO was fairy well known as IPOs go. It was nowhere on the order of a Facebook or Google but it was not totally obscure either. I’d say slightly above average in terms of visibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 06:43:45'] Under the radar; dont forget tesla had a small roadster car with low range, being a bit of a laughing point for electric cars not to work. Only when the model S launched and people got proven there is a future for it; the stock exploded.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 07:53:38'] Not to mention the timing was pretty bad. 2009 was the automaker bailout extravaganza so a lot retail investors were terrified of auto in general. The logic was that if even the giants of the industry weren't safe then how could anyone be brave enough to take a shot on a startup.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 11:02:42'] Tesla had a lot of gov $$$ to start up. That was the single biggest chunk. At the time, EVs were all thought of as Toyota Hybrids, Honda. Prius. A novelty. There was a lot of time the company spent near the peril of possible bankruptcy. It's fortunate that most of its existence was in the era of cheap cheap cheap money via 0% rates from the Fed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 22:55:12'] Tesla was quite popular the moment Elon became a bit more mainstream to the point where it was at $400 at some point. But ever since he became a bit of "annoying" on  twitter, it started to plummet and not to mention, the bad news about the car crash of Tesla.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla Inc. has produced more than 3 million vehicles, and a third of them have been built in China, according to Elon Musk. On Sunday, the Tesla chief executive congratulated the companys Shanghai gigafactory in a tweet: Congrats Giga Shanghai on making millionth car! Total Teslas made now over 3M.\n\nThe milestone came just a few weeks after Musk said Teslas factory in Fremont, Calif., produced its 2 millionth vehicle. Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as money furnaces. The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Streets expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. \n\nWhen earnings were released, Musk sa'

In other words, they'll make as many cars in the next 10 months, as they did in the last 30.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:00:45'] As an actual truck driver, the last people you should be listening to on this is the vast majority of actual truck drivers. If most drivers I've met had it their way, we'd still be running 24 hours a day with no required rest on paper logs. On meth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:59:03'] To be honest, I don’t believe anyone understands the transport industry on Reddit. Companies purchase heavy vehicles in order to turn a profit. End of story. There is no wow factor. All manufacturers offer a slightly varying product. Some are designed for heavy spec, ie paccar(Kenworth and Peterbilt). Others are designed for traditional use such as Freightliner and Volvo.Furthermore, the Tesla semi’s are day cabs. They are not the traditional sleeper we associate with a semi. The shape and structure are very misleading in this regard. The average accident involving a heavy vehicle in the unites states for 2021 was $148,279. Now imagine your semi is a Tesla, a $400,000 dollar vehicle. More than twice the price of a typical day cab. Insurance premiums for fleets are above $20,000 per vehicle as is. If you started adding vehicles to your fleet that are driven by the worst drivers in the industry, it is guaranteed your premiums would be considerably higher. I say this because the drivers with the lowest turnover and insurance premiums are long distance drivers and non traditional loads(heavy spec, flat deck, step deck, drop frame… etc.The end of the day corporations only care about ROI. In transport the margins are razor thin. If a Tesla provides a better ROI than traditional manufacturers, I could understand the hype surrounding this vehicle.Edit. Im being downvoted for stating facts. Stocks is becoming wsb 2.0. I am not for or against Tesla when it comes to investing. I don't factor emotion into the decision. If there is a path forward for Tesla to be successful in the space then I am very intrigued. If someone can outline a path to this success I am very intrigued to learn.

Calling a spacious cabin a “waste of space” is fair but only if you prefer a cramped cab with a shit ton of random storage compartments.this is also one persons opinion, compared to an entire company’s design team alongside actual truck drivers.. the first sentence also shows this guy has a negative tone towards the company already.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:02:36'] This rant is just a misalignment surrounding expectations. Version 0 of any product is not the final form nor is it the best implementation of what the product could become. No one in any industry expects v0 to be some ultimate game changing product without real user testing, feedback and continuous improvement. Even home appliance products that people love like the InstantPot keeps getting improved over time. The version today looks a lot different than the original product.Whether or not the semi becomes a dominant player is anyone's guess, but Tesla has shown that they can deliver a product in a different vertical vs the consumer car industry. This opens up additional opportunities for Tesla to refine and improve their trucking capabilities. It's a net positive for their business and a net win for the industry, as it will also create additional competition for existing players in the space. Competition means that more dollars will be spent refining vehicles to make a better end product.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:32:40'] Lots of good points raised. I suspect this will change zero people's minds.

Not the least of which was enormous amounts of horse manure in big cities, like New York. Feeding horses, dealing with horse carcasses, etc.Tesla has yet to make the same practical leap. So far they've survived on enormous government subsidy. Full self driving is becoming the new graphite. It's always right around the corner.Whoever cracks true full self driving, if they can protect the franchise, will own a money printing machine.

Maybe now we won’t have any truck drivers hogging the fast lane just to pass another truck going 1mph slower. Taking 10 god damn miles to do it. Now they’ll have some real torque to pass and move over. I feel Elon should have taken it once step further and invented flying trailers. Semis trucks need to be off the road all together.

The only hope would be for the public to demand its elected  officials implement a law that no households who have any members who work for the US government are allowed to own anything but personal assets (house, cars, etc.) and US treasuries for life. I can’t imagine what kind of unintended consequences would result from a blanket ban for life or even just while the individual is working for the government. The problem is there’s no good solution. We clearly can’t rely on the integrity of these officials to do the right thing and the only solutions will be too extreme (not to mention highly unlikely to ever get implemented).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:31:06'] > Perhaps soda products are stored and routed differently than lighter food products.My knowledge is second hand, and somewhat dated, but historically soda companies have far more regional bottling plans than food companies have processing/factories.  Soda is mostly water, and the ingredients can be shipped almost anywhere to be "turned into soda" fairly easily.  Because of this, it is a lot easier to enter into contracts with local bottlers, so sodas in their finished form don't have nearly as far to travel.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:59:09'] I've worked in trucking. The comment regarding the 100 mile routes is likely saying the trucks will just be used for short dedicated routes. Not that they get that range.Edit: It's fairly common for trucking companies to have short route dedicated loads. This is where the Semi would excel until they can get a truck that has the same range as a ice semi.Edit2: Or until they build out semi chargers. I think 800-1000 mile range would be the sweet spot for long haul assuming semi chargers are readily available at stops.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:32:24'] Water is heavy and available all over the country. Bottling and distribution centers for soda are built in every region because it doesn't make sense to haul soda long distance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:43:43'] Pepsi made a wise investment for the tesla semi. If they can manage their fleet to make vital short distance trips, the fuel savings would easily be recovered for the duration of their investments into the truck. This was literally a no brainer decision

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:09:37'] I would not trust those stats for several reasons. First of all because of the crazy CEO. Then the range varies a lot with temperature, load and average speed. The batteries could just be prototypes that cost 10x as much as a standard cell but provide maybe 5% more power. Most of all, any lithium battery can be pushed to its limit by shortening its lifespan. If you don’t care if it only lasts 300charges vs 3000, then you can get much more range out of it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 04:51:40'] The amount of uneducated comments is insane and I get that there is no way to change everybody's minds, but I'd like to point out one thing regarding the comments "Other OEMs will have better Economies of Scale":This isn't some chart with a decending line out of a text book and capital intensive industries like car manufacturing are insanely complicated in the real world. OEMs assembling 8m ICE cars per year won't automatically switch over to assembling 8m BEVs. You would have to depreciate/ amortize entire production sites worth many billions on their books, invest billions to convert them for months if not years (meaning there's no production in the meantime), completely retrain staff, all the while likely producing less cars per site, per employee and per capital invested than Tesla currently does at their plants. Anyone working in the industry will tell you how fascinating it is what they achieve atm. They drastically cut the time a car is being assembled, production steps required, factory footpring required, employees required, factory downtime required, etc. And the craziest part? It's continuously getting better. Giga Shanghai is way better than Fremont (former legacy OEM factory), Berlin and Texas are again improved compared to Giga Shanghai which also was recently further optimized. Which might not sound crazy, but it enables Tesla to produce 500k cars out of a factory that a legacy OEM could only get 300k out of. Now you tell me about the cost structures of both vehicles. There is no use in producing 2 models at a 300k annual run rate at two different production sites when you can produce one model at 600k annual rr out of one site. Not only are the directly attributed fix costs significantly less, the entire logistics become so much easier as well. Further points are issues like vertical integration. Yes, BMW and Daimler are seemingly catching up in many aspects of BEVs, BUT: they do so with heavy reliance (core parts of BEVs, not easily interchangeable parts) on Bosch, Continental, and more. And they all get their piece of the cake. Same with VWs planned battery plants. Most (if not all) are joint ventures for which VW actively seeks outside funding and business partners. They all will get their margins.Especially troubling are issues like software. Yes, VW has been hell bent to catch up with its software, but Cariad has not been a success story so far and already needs outside help, won't achieve its 2025 goals (according to VW themselves) and costs VW indirectly money in the meantime (through lack of OTA updates and more). All the while employing more software developers than Tesla does (excl. FSD projects). Add being locked in in the dealership structure and other issues, and you will see that legacy OEMs are facing lower margins, huge upfront expenditures (investments) and depreciation, dependency on key suppliers and more. We have yet to see a legacy OEM ramp up EV production the way Tesla does. Only real competition on that part is BYD for example.Higher quality trims, better finishing and a larger product portfolio are not exactly a guarantee of success in such a fundamental transition. That's just my take on it. Feel free to argue otherwise, I'd be happy to hear opposing views to this as long as they are not just high level buzz words.

So I'm just gonna sparknotes some inmportant points.&#x200B;1. Tesla has a 15+ year head start on modern day EV assembly. They're playing a TOTALLY different game than competitors. OTher companies are asking "how do we get a car at the same specs as a Tesla that's profitable?" While Tesla is asking "how few batteries can you put in a car so we can ship as many as possible?"2. EVs require a completely different field of engineering, rendering much of the workforce and infrastructure of legacy manufacturers largely useless (and an active hinderince, like in unions, cuz EV transition = union employees lose jobs).3. Other manufacturers can't reach profitability with EVs while Tesla has iPhone-level margins on its cars. LIke...wrap your head around that. IT's unheard of, there's no industry comparison. And other companies can't simply "focus" on EVs and magically reach that same level of profitability.4. Tesla's software advantage. Yes, other luxury cars might have nice interior buttons, but the software experience is MILES apart, and it's so painfully apparent. This is a 5000+ post alone. You should research it.5. Tesla's vertical integration. There's a reason the US passed a multi-billion dollar bill to secure the battery supply. Good video here on how fucked the US is by relying on China so much - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM) Tesla's the only company that is taking major vertical integration steps like creating its on cathode refining facility and supporting miners."Cool...but other luxury car makers are gonna make fancy cars and people will prefer that to Teslas because buttons and standing out."Like...okay. Let's see how well niche manufacturing of $150,000+ cars on sub 15% gross margin works out and how many people will wanna buy those (with inferior specs). There will always be people who want inferior products for same intangible brand reason (looking at you Jeep), but how consequential is that? We're on an investing forum, and the Tesla Model S basically outperforms 99% of all $1 million+ super cars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC\_AoSnPrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC_AoSnPrQ) this is basic? This is not fun? IDK. Bring a Tesla to any elementary school and see the kids' reactions. That will tell you all you need to know about the Tesla brand prestige.This is not including the roadster, which will have possibly low 1s in 0-60 acceleration, 500+ miles of range, and maybe even have SpaceX rocket thrusters on it in order to achieve its speeds.If Tesla sells 20 million cars in 2030 on 20% gross margin, it will be the largest company in the world, point blank.And yes...Tesla energy will be as big as Tesla cars. Very clear pathway for that. Forget largest company in the world, Tesla's basically the modern day East India Company
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 22:45:27'] I think Tesla will do well for the next 2 years then start seeing sales drop. Other manufacturers are going to catch up on tech, and their interiors and build quality is already way better than Tesla (go sit in an eTron Chronos or Taycan). Eventually, the constant price hikes are going to push people to other brands.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 20:39:02'] Tesla has everything locked up so much it's not even funny. Anyone that tells you "the competition is coming" knows absolutely nothing about the current state of this industry. Being good at ice != Being good at BEV.Supply chain - Not a single NA or European OEM has a quarter of the supply chain figured out that Tesla does. I'm talking actual mine contracts here. Not just battery factories planned someday like every OEM thinks they are going to do. Real contacts with mines to keep up with Teslas growth plans. Tesla has them locked downCharging Network - Self explanatory. Everyone else is fucked with charging right now and that's not changing anytime soon. Best case soon OEMs start using Teslas network and then their customers are in Teslas ecosystem. Tesla wins again.Brand Power - Kids/teenagers/college age are the trend setters and they are obsessed with Tesla. Just like iPhonesVertical Integration - No one but rivian is vertically integrated like Tesla is. Tesla can do lighting fast ota updates, late supply chip changes by writing new firmware, not wait or rely on apple / Google etc for infotainment, unlimited software support due to not having vendor contracts with monopolistic companies like qualcomm

Particularly VPPs could be a neat money maker. Others are making EVs too, but have you looked at the volumes? Before the ICE market is eaten up there's also no real argument to be made with regards to "competition is coming". As long as there's more demand than supply the entire concept of 'competition' makes no sense. Tesla has THE global charging network which they will open up - so they will be making money off the automotive market at both ends. With the different corporate culture I also can't really see anyone catching up when it comes to tech and added value to the customer (People are beginning to notice that Tesla keeps giving their customers really useful goodies for free after sale).I'm not counting on FSD, bot or robotaxi. Either of which would be huge on its own, but Tesla will do just fine for the next 10 years without them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 19:37:04'] I think Tesla will struggle as older, larger companies start mass producing reliable electric vehicles. Innovation will be less important compared to quality control because the technology will be more commonplace. Tesla's direct-to-consumer website to sell is a great way to reduce costs and saves opening dealerships sure, but once people can go to a local Ford, etc dealership that they bought their last cars from and know the mechanics, then they'll get an electric vehicle from them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 22:11:13'] It’s so hard to scale EV and supply chain and they are years ahead. Only folks that have a shot are the big existing players (gmc, Ford , Hyundai/kia) and maybe rivian with their funding. Full disclosure, I hate Elon, don’t love the stock, and own a Tesla. Had I put my down payment towards Tesla stock, i would be retiring in 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 20:05:16'] Think they’re in trouble. They will sell a lot of cars but with each year there’s going to be more and more competition. By trouble I don’t mean bankrupt or irrelevant just their business will continue to get more competitive.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 13:23:58'] Wow there is a lot of misinformation in here. As a former Tesla employee I can assure you they are not “5 years ahead of everyone” and unstoppable. They are always losing their best employees and cut corners everywhere to save money. The customer is often the beta tester running untested parts and software just so they can hit delivery goals, their stock price depends on it. The magic is in the batteries and soon the big boys will catch up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 23:44:27'] I agree with much of what's already been posted in the thread. They're executing well in nearly all areas, including scaling up supply contracts to ramp up their battery supply.Tesla's only lagging in service. The number of store & service locations grew by 20% in Q1, vs. a production increase of 68%.The competition is coming, but it's far behind. E.g.: Toyota & BMW, after years of R&D on hydrogen fuel cells, are still hyping Hydrogen. The Toyota Mirai is a compliance car, reliant on a hydrogen infrastructure that primarily exists (sparsely) in California. Where are these hydrogen cars going to refuel elsewhere? Infrastructure is someone else's problem! /sTesla's Supercharger network continues to expand, although not quickly enough. The Legacy manufacturers wish someone else would build out a third party supercharging network for them. Once Tesla opens up their charging network globally, that will solve that problem for them, but in the intervening time, how many consumers will just buy a Tesla instead? Most will.Having a focus on increasing battery supply & improving autonomy, Tesla will continue it's EV supremacy, though the market might not have that clarification for awhile.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 21:13:44'] lol> I think Elons a swell guy and alleh, not so much.  Like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates... he has some non-swell issues> There’s a lot more competition now Tesla killers are always just around the corner.   They never arrive.Some day someone will match them on features.Then the next hurdle is matching them on production volume.Then the next hurdle will be matching them on profit margin at volume. No one is likely to catch them on all three in 10 years.Tesla has gone from two factories to 4... they are still ramping the 2 new factories, so they aren't efficient/printing money yet.  Then they'll be adding more.> On top of that, they’re pretty basic and not as fun as some of the other brands.hahahano> If I were to say they’re going to stay on top, it’d be because they focus more on energy storage and shift away from cars.They get compared to Apple alot, but they will be more like Microsoft.  Microsoft did not 'shift away from operating systems' to also dominate in business/office applications, gaming systems, cloud hosting, AI, etc.> I could also see Tesla becoming the next Toyota of cars (cheap but plentiful cars) however I don’t see them competing with upper end brands for much longer.For much longer?  They are focusing on ramping and maximizing profits, but I have yet to see an upper end brand that will beat the Roadster 2.0.   Also, Lucid is focusing on 'upper end EVs'.  They got boned by the recent EV act that focuses on encouraging producing/selling cars more in reach of the average person.  The market will be a bumpy ride for the next 2-15 months, but it's probably a good time to get into TSLA.  The market crashed today, losing a weeks' worth of gains.  TSLA only lost 2 days of gain (and is well above where it was 5 days ago).  It will have some big down days in the future (with macro) but the lows are likely already in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:09:21'] Just to give a counter example: RenaultTheir electric model is the Zoe. And the Renault Zoe is one of the best selling electric car in Europe. But, surprise, surprise… Renault does not make big profits of the Zoe! Why?Renault do not make their own battery, they have to buy it to another company. And the battery is the bigger part of the cost of an electric car. What makes Tesla « great » is not their car. Is the fact that they already have their own battery technology. And their own software to run the car. Another example was VW, which had started to build electric cars a few years ago… but did not have a software for it. And we are not sure all those actual car brands will have the necessary technology « in house » in the future years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:27:03'] It’s really quite simple. For the next decade, EVs will have higher demand than supply as they go from single digit percentage of global automotive sales to high double digit percentage. Tesla has invested more into the EV supply chain than anyone else, and continues to do so. Nobody even comes close to the amount of battery capacity Tesla is securing. Therefore, every automaker will be able to sell only as many EVs as their supply chain allows, and Tesla is so far ahead in securing supplies that others won’t catch up. And finally, Tesla has the highest margins in the volume automotive industry and the most pricing power.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 04:18:18'] The problem with TSLA is that cars are a basically commodities and I don't see that changing. What I mean by that is that most people won't buy a TSLA at any price just because it's a TSLA. Right now TSLA has pricing power because there isn't much competition in the EV space, but that's changing.The reason companies like GOOG or V can demand high margins is because there's a moat to competition. There's no real moat to EVs. Any company can enter the space and if they produce a decent EV TSLA has to compete with them. This is why the automobile sector generally trades at lower valuations. There's no margin guarantee and there's no guarantee that what you're able sell this year you'll sell next year.And it's not just competition in the automobile space you need to worry about. Cars also compete with public transport. As more people move to cities car ownership will decline in favour of public transport. Trends like this will continue to be a headwind for the entire industry for years to come.I like TSLA and have invested in the past. It's just right now at the current valuation it's hard to not see a lot of risks with limited upside. You really have to believe in the innovation story today. If Elon can continue to grow the business in new innovative ways then it could be a good investment, but it's not without it's risks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 19:01:23'] I think the best play for Tesla / Elon is to stay exceeding far ahead of the competition with technology and self-driving cars.The giants can beat him at every other aspect of automaking (better design, better prestige, better quality control, better economies at scale, lower costs, better aftersale service)But what Tesla has the edge in in making risky moves, and being a technology leader (especially in autonomous driving) live testing beta software their customers? Tesla is down. Heck, they gave autopilot a mad max mode. Let's see a legacy maker greenlight that.This is, of course, just my uneducated ramblings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 05:01:30'] EVs level the playing field as far as driving experience. All of them a fast. All of them are quiet. The only thing to set each brand apart will be exterior styling and interior features/quality. Range is pretty much just a factor of how big your battery is. Tesla does have the supercharger network. Probably it’s biggest asset in my opinion. Range anxiety is still a big thing for a lot of people.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 06:18:08'] I’m no Tesla fan boy but you could make an argument that Tesla is already 4-5 years ahead of the competition, just due to the fact that they have a few generations of EVs under their belt and have been selling, redesigning, maintaining and troubleshooting these things for a while. Not to mention EVs, are what they do, it’s all they do, it’s all they have ever done. It’s kinda hard to argue that the competition has even started to close that gap. So barring a technological breakthrough from another car company, I think Tesla has enough of a head start to stay on top of the EV game for a while.

Other carmakers need to find a way to reliably source their batteries as you can’t simply put them on a plane and ship them nor just simply bought made in China batteries emperor Xi will kill that deal anytime.The logistic support behind the EV is no joke. It’s no longer go to conventional car parts suppliers and cherry-pick parts and slap everything together to make new looking car annually. It’s all about the batteries and Tesla had already contracted with major batteries material sourcers in the world (Indonesia, Thailand etc.) they already set it up in a way that individual gigafactory will source their material locally so their supply chain issues are lessen then most automakers.I’ll say whoever working on supply chain logistic at Tesla is a genius for going for the local self sustaining model.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:32:15'] Don't think most investors in Tesla think its an EV company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:33:12'] Yeah, you discovered the bear case for Tesla. Their stock price is built on hopium and expectations of world domination.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:48:07'] Tesla’s current 1up on the competition is their supercharger network. If other companies get something similar or partner with EV charging companies it’s only a matter of time before other companies become serious competition. I don’t think they’ll see sales decline though, as more people switch to EV the market will grow and even with various competitors they’ll be room for growth, at least in the next 10 years… 20-30 is a different story

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:53:40'] One issue I rarely see mentioned in this discussion is the relative inefficiency of longer range EV trips.  Range anxiety and inconvenience of charging on the way are real issues, but for most drivers this is only true once in a while.  If 90+% of driving can be covered by say a 50 mile range, it means the car could get away with a smaller battery backed up by an ICE (i.e. PHEV).  Extra range beyond that will be useful now and then, but most of the time it's just a heavy ass battery that's not really needed and presumably could have been split across multiple cars.Given that PHEVs can offer 90+% of the fuel offset with a battery something like 20% the size (compared with full EVs), why does the world seem so quick to move past PHEVs?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 10:04:52'] Tesla will remain #1 in EV sales if only because they got such a great headstart and the building of these new huge production facilities will only enhance their experience.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 10:06:24'] In terms of Tesla vs legacy automaker, there is no competition, not just from the products itself, but also from the backend. Tesla as a company does not have the structures of legacy automakers with their dealership network. This network costs the company a LOT and this means lower profit, but also headaches for customers. The legacy automaker is also projected to have lower profitability than Tesla for the next decade or until whenever the world is mostly EV. This is because they hold on their balance sheets a lot of assets that are related to ICE cars. This has to be written off on a yearly basis, so this means, profitability that is super under pressured. Not only is Tesla more profitable than any other car company right now without these write offs, but once these writeoffs BEGIN (they have not), Tesla's valuation will just demolish all legacy automakers, this is why it should be that Tesla's valuation is way more than legacy automakers because Tesla does not have all these extra costs. Remember that an EV company's valuation is based on the value of their EV business minus the costs to get rid of their ICE business. Because Tesla has no ICE business, it basically will at least double the profitability of the next legacy automaker. The only real competition from an investment standpoint to Tesla is a company like Rivian, NIO, etc.Now on to the business itself. Tesla has basically almost a monopoly on batteries. Even legacy automakers like Benz is not able to get batteries as much as Tesla can. If you want to order an EV from them, its also on wait list, mostly because they dont have the parts to fulfill the demand, and this is not going to change anytime soon. Tesla not only have secured supply but the newest tech in battery. Think about it, if you are a battery company, which company would you want to supply? Benz that buys 25k batteries from your per year, or Tesla that will buy 1.5M? Off course you will approach Tesla first. Tesla also is producing their cars at lower cost for the same build quality due to their innovation in manufacturing. I own both a Tesla and a Benz, their build quality now is similar, its just that people do not scrutinize Benz build quality as they just trust it already, but Benz has as much panel gaps and even more than my Tesla lol, but when you buy a Benz, you dont spend like an hour at the dealer using your flashlight scrutinizing every paint defect, and then another 6 hours at home going through a checklist.Technology, Tesla is also still ahead. Which car company that is a real competitor today has a similar offering to Tesla's screen? Even the new EQS from benz, has lags and clutter. Which car also have access to something similar to a supercharger network. Many people love the ioniq 5 and even Rivian, but unless you own your own home, you will need to rely on these charging stations, read what people are experiencing, its not bad, but definitely not as good as Tesla's and it will not show noticeable improvements until maybe 2 years from now, or if Tesla starts opening up their supercharger network.&#x200B;There are more, but really today if you are buying an EV, currently Tesla's true competitors are the Hyunda Kia cars and Rivian. The other cars will sell, but Tesla does not need to sell the most cars to be the number one carmaker. Next year the Model Y is projected to be the best selling car in the world in terms of units. In 2022, it already is the best selling car based on Revenue. There are many points that I have left out as it would be too long of a reply, but all signs still showing to Tesla dominance in the next 5 years unless Rivian starts ramping up like crazy, or NIO comes stateside, IONIQ5s can scale faster, etc, which is not happening soon. No matter how good the Hyunda Kia cars are, they are not a real contender for investment for the reasons i mentioned in the first paragraph above.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 10:14:50'] Wow the comments here are feisty! I’m a little scared but here are my 2 cents. Tesla is doing well, they will continue to do well and expand and dominate the EV market at least for the next few years and maybe longer. That doesn’t mean they aren’t overvalued. We all know Tesla is doing well and expansion and growth is continuing. That’s why the price is already so high. Everyone on here is so confident of their read on the situation. Like, maybe the TSLA fans are right and in 10 years the global market is 95% EV and TSLA has 60% of that market. In that case then they’re probably undervalued today and an amazing buy. But also maybe the bears are right and in 10 years the market is stuck at like 15-20% EV and Tesla only has 20% of the market. Personally, I reckon it will be somewhere in the middle and TSLA has some upside, but not enough to make it a buy for me.

If they stay primarily a car company then expect the stock price to plummet as they either become increasingly niche or else face very difficult competition, driving margins and growth way down as they have to spend more and reduce prices and margins.  If they morph into more of a services company (the Apple model of hardware and software/services) then who knows where they will be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 05:16:07'] A lot of folks are buying Teslas now because 1. It’s good price to performance and 2. The competition sucks balls. Anyone that steps into a dealership of competitors will run home and book a Tesla. That said, I already have a Model S and bought a Model Y for my wife in Jan and quickly sold it (for loss 10% of price in sales tax) because my wife hated the ride quality (noise and vibrations). I couldn’t find much fault myself either. The vehicle drove like shit on the freeway and the interiors looked cheap too.Since then, I booked a VW ID.4 and test drive it. It’s cheaper and has less power and less range compared to a model Y but damn it, the ride is much better. Feels like a normal regular SUV. If Volkswagen makes them fast enough and keeps the price competitiveness, I’m almost certain a lot of people will go for it. Bottom line is (and I’m saying this with the bias of being a Tesla fan), in two to three years, Tesla will be another brand in the EV market - it can’t maintain the price advantage - it’s prices will come down (and Musk being the shrewd businessman, won’t mind reducing the prices to stay competitive).
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:53:37'] Not sure they’ll survive unless they are bought by another car manufacturer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 04:56:55'] Tesla EPS is 2.81 and estimated to grow at 45% annualized for next 5 years. Lets say there isn't a major recession in the US and Tesla manage to grow at that impressive rate, their EPS in 5 years will be 18.01  Okay, now a PE of 25 would put future share price at $450, and that's a generous PE. Giving you an annualised return of 9.03%, which is about what S&P500 averages.So, Tesla is actually valued correctly based on it's earnings forecast. The real key to whether this will play is if they hit their targets.  How are Tesla going to achieve at annualized earnings growth of 45%? I'm yet to see their plan, because at the moment, they look a bit stuck. Their new car factories are tanking billions of dollars and consumer credit is drying up with these FED hikes. They've been promising battery technology but there has been nothing tangible in this space. Their production capabilities are bottlenecked by chip manufactures and any escalation in Taiwan would make this worse. Their target is small and there are only so many people with enough money to buy a Tesla. How do they reach the lower income households to be a far reaching brand like Volkswagen or Toyota?

Tesla’s share in the market will be much lesser and much cheaper by then because of too many competition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:56:04'] Just depends on if Tesla can get thier semi truck production up and running. If they turn out as good as the specs then tesla will dominate the semi trucking industry. That alone will keep them on top. Now lets say tesla also gets the roadster production sorted out too, would be a major income for tesla. After that they should focus on making an ev for under 20k. Everyone wants a tesla but the price is stopping most from getting one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:07:26']  Reflecting back to 1995… but is Tesla not merely the Netscape of the EV revolution? With the Google yet to come?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:22:09'] lol. wut. You think Elon's a 'swell guy and all' or was that being facetious?  I think you are being serious based on your comment that he knows what he is doing.  Look more closely at their SEC filings and where their profitability is coming from.  I'd be concerned that might pull a RCA/toshiba down the road.  Fit and finish - side by side against a taycan - no comparison.  Haven't looked closely at the Model X.  To me, him and the stockholders have been rewarded tremendously for being a catalyst that moved other manufacturers, and made EV more mainstream.  But now, I think his antics detracts and is disappointing.  I'm impressed with the Kia EV - I thought it looks pretty nice.  For Tesla - they need to improve build quality, and keep their word.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:38:29'] The answer relies to what is going to happen after 10 years of Tesla ownership? Are consumers willing to spend up to $20k to replace the battery? We have buy first and think later mentality so this is going to be interesting to watch.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:44:10'] Tesla will do great but even if tesla exceeds Apple in market cap, stock price will only double the current price at max. I will rather invest in something that will make more than just double in the senario of becoming the largest market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 08:54:14'] Teslas problem will start with autonomous cars , google are going to give its platform for free , keep developing it and basically be the android of the auto industry, in exchange they will get complete access to your data , as they do today with android , Tesla who wants to be Apple and go solo will be in a world of pain , as you mentioned their sw is one of their biggest advantages but when you compare them to a company like google they are a small startup in comparison, this is where they fail in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 16:41:10'] I don't think they will.  I'm seeing more of their competitors on the road every day and their service infrastructure is terrible. My prediction is Tesla perfects the self driving software, licenses it out to all the other manufacturers and stops making cars completely.  They keep the charging network or sell it to the highest bidder and deal strictly in software and battery tech, tesla's core competancies. its just a theory though, who knows.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 19:33:16'] I think it’s already undervalued and overdue for a significant bounce. Here’s why:This year, Tesla will post ~$10B free cash flow (up 100% from last year, 258% from 2 years ago, and 827% from 3 years ago). Now let’s do a simple and conservative 10 year discounted cash flow with the following assumptions:1.	⁠⁠⁠12% discount rate in the 10 year period2.	⁠⁠⁠8% terminal discount rate3.	⁠⁠⁠3% terminal growth rate inline with GDP growth, and less than half S&P 500 long term earnings growth rate.4.	⁠⁠⁠40% free cash flow growth in the first year that glides down linearly to 3% over the 10 years. This averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 23%, which is similar to Apple/Google over the 10 years after they first reached ~$10b FCF.The result of such a DCF is a present value of $190 per share with quite conservative assumptions. There is plenty of upside: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns, and you can make bull cases several times higher than today’s Tesla price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 19:04:41'] Would like to see its market cap closer to GM, Ford or Stellantis. And after watching the performance of other companies who have part time CEO's, I probably would not invest until it had a full time management team.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 20:36:32'] i think the problem is car manufacturer's eps and pe ratio hugely depends on the profit margin.  So it become really hard to guess pe ratio.  tesla could cut price by a few thousands and their eps could get cut in half.  if tesla can sell their car a few thousand dollar more expensive its eps could jump by 50 percent.so when elon musk come out on twitter space and say they might cut car price or even sell car at a loss to gain market share, it should be a red flag.  My price target for 2030 is about 2 times toyota market cap right now.  So my price target for 2030 is about 120$.  and i give it 2x toyota because it have fsd and energy sector etc.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 14:52:32'] The amount of misleading info people post is astounding.The sale of BTC doesn't go towards free cash flow. Free cash flow is the balance of operating subtracting CapEX.Tesla's operating cash flow: $2.351 billionTesla's CapEx: $1.73 billion  Free cash flow (Operating cash flow - CapEx) = $621 million."But they sold BTC and would have had negative cash flow."  Cash flow is broken down into categories. Investing cash flow is one of them. For Q2-2021, Tesla's investing cash flow was $(1.515) billion. Exclude the BTC sale and it would be $(1.820) for Q2-2022. They are TWO separate things. Please don't trust anything a Reddit user says and verify the information yourself.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 13:44:41'] No matter how you read these numbers, Tesla investors should be focused on the long term. The numbers will continue to look better and better, margins will increase and production will grow. No matter what the haters say the EV demand will accelerate and only Tesla and VW will be able to significantly meet the consumer demand. Maybe other big companies will get their act together but it's looking like it will take a while, by that time Tesla will be leaving them in the dust. But the real juice is the 2030-2040 stock price. Nobody in their right mind is selling before then. Opportunities like this do not come along very often and we will see a very high stock price over the next 10-15 years. So if you've got time to wait then this is a very good time to buy. I'm sure many of you will downvote me. But it's the same story in every thread, bears who do not understand the company downvote the bulls without ever offering up a single reason why Tesla will not be a huge success.

Tesla will remain profitable but if they really succeed it will be on the back of the EV charging network and energy storage.  Their car business?  Reminds me of a drug company.  Generic drugs are now approved so to speak so their income from their specialty drug will start reducing exponentially as it becomes less rare and novel and other companies offer the same thing.  They will need to branch out.  Not to mention Elon seems to be heading the way of Kanye and in the business world that could be disastrous.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:59:47'] They delivered less vehicles than they produced because their trying not to do the giant end of the quarter rush they typically have been doing. This rush causes pains on the consumer and employee side, as well as increasing expedite costs. In other words whatever vehicles are in mid transit atm and didn’t reach the customer will be added to Q4 deliveries.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:20:05'] They are set to produce 495k in Q4.

I expect they will have to reduce prices in 2024 and beyond significantly to keep growth going at 50%, it’s hard to imagine maintaining these margins with a global recession.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 11:20:11'] 365k is incredible considering Shanghai was down for retooling for quite a bit. Q4 is expected to be 500K+, more than what Audi currently does and close to BMW, but at twice the margins.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:01:59'] Kanye West once said, if Elon Musk has a bad day, humans have a bad life.Tesla is the barometer of the auto industry. If Tesla does bad, other auto companies are going to do worse. Deliveries fell short but their explanation is reasonable. Other auto companies have the infrastructure in place to handle that kind of volume because it was set in place for decades, plus, they ship to the dealership while Tesla does direct. It's more of a logistical process for Tesla than it is for other automakers since they cut off the middleman.Production is more important. If they can keep pumping them out, it will be sold regardless of which quarter it falls in line with. The market has been bleeding red regardless of what positive news is out there. Tesla is a long-term hold. I'm not worried about how it does in the short-term market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 23:07:09'] First Tesla is not a car company--it is a technology company that just happens to put their tech in cars. So production numbers don't really matter. Except when the production numbers are good. Second, in ten years Tesla ~~will be making cars~~ have their tech in every ~~moving vehicle~~ thing ~~on Earth the Moon~~, in the Milky Way Galaxy so at this price ~~it is extremely cheap~~ they are basically giving the company away.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 15:42:08'] Before people start speculating, Robinhood is not executing these orders itself.>Robinhood will route customers’ nighttime stock orders to Blue Ocean, a trading platform that runs a special session between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. ET. Other U.S. brokers that offer overnight trading use Blue Ocean as well. Electronic market-making firms such as Jane Street Group and Virtu Financial take the other side of investors’ orders on Blue Ocean[https://archive.ph/CwKEJ](https://archive.ph/CwKEJ)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 16:14:47'] I don't think it's the worst. Big money can sell their shares at any moment causing huge price swings and can leave investors holding the bag the next day when market opens. Atleast it gives everyday investors some options.As for the gambling aspect people who trade stocks in general are gambling. They're going to gamble regardless with their stocks, panic selling, panic buying, etc. Long term investors aren't going to use this feature much.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 10:43:57'] Shocking. Another bajillionaire is really a creep and a narcissist.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:16:44'] Let’s see how long he will remain in his positions, he is or probably will no longer be a net benefit for Tesla. Other manufacturers are catching up, giving the largely democratic customer base much more choice. Don’t underestimate the power of a brands political association in these polarised times, I personally know multiple people who want an EV but are avoiding Tesla at all cost due to these reasons and the quality issues. He stated in the past that it is Teslas goal to electrify the transportation sector, so why is he supporting a party that is hellbent on defending fossil fuels? Just so he can „own the libs“?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:36:33'] Is Elon flaming out?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 20:16:09'] Elon flipping ~~blue~~ red opens up the other 50% of the US. Bullish AF.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:34:00'] Alienating more than 60% of your potential customers in the US is not a winning strategy. It’s clear that he posted allegiance to the GQP right before the sexual harassment news broke. He knew that GQP would not give a shit and fully embrace him regardless of what he did. And he was right. Whether potential EV buyers will be fully turned off by his childish antics or not remains to be seen. Still, based on his past, social emotional control is not his strong suit so I think a lot more dark days are ahead of him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 20:07:28'] Reddit is very far left. So majority of people are going to think this is a big deal here. In reality, there is maybe up to 10% of the population who gives a shit. The rest don’t.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:44:12'] As Musk leans into creepiness, politics, and securities fraud, Tesla will want less and less to do with him. Even before this, things like "taking Tesla private" and the very public failure of Tesla's truck should have been red flags, indicating that he's just a third rate Steve Jobs who'd rather bullshit on Twitter than see major projects through.Musk's cult of personality was an asset when his companies needed hype, but it's turn into a serious liability. At some point cutting him loose will be matter of responsibility to shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 14:49:47'] I am a software engineer and lately I’ve been doing data science things. My employer says I’m a data scientist but I don’t really agree. But I do do a little bit of that as part of my job. In my relatively short time (1 year) doing ML/AI/data science things for my job, it seems to me that while all theoretically possible, the tools to get to things like self-driving cars don’t exist in the same way that tools for making an iOS app exist. Also, you can Google how to make an iOS app all day long, but in my day to day work I find it’s common to just not find anything on the internet about what I’m trying to build or do with ML/AI. I think it’s only a matter of time before Teslas really do drive themselves without any sort of disclaimer or asterisk attached. Part of it is in software as much as we try, we can’t always find all the bugs before going to production and releasing code to the users… and that’s for web apps. To thoroughly test Autopilot… I’m not sure it’s realistic. I think there will be more Autopilot crashes/cases where it didn’t do what it was expected or supposed to do. Is what it is. Airplanes took a few decades of disaster before all the kinks were worked out. At this point, if a commercial plane crashes it’s almost certainly pilot error. Pilots (people) fly planes, and people write software like Autopilot. We aren’t perfect so Autopilot won’t be either, for a time anyway.Also, people like to wax about how TSLA is worth X because they have the largest network of charging stations in the US. That’s definitely worth something, but even more so is the IP that is Autopilot. Ford and others will spend TRILLIONS building their own self-driving hardware and software, and those will all have accidents too, unless Tesla decides to sell the Autopilot tech, but that doesn’t seem likely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 12:07:14'] Elon always over promise but at least Space X is meeting its launch targets.He knows Tesla really only has less than 5 years left dominating the EV market.The big boys are catching up fast.Why did all of sudden turn on the democrats?.Was it the Me Too Movement catching up to him,taxation on billionaires or him screwing himself with the Twitter fiasco.Probably all three.Biden speech also named GM and Ford as USA EV future and not Tesla.Elon feelings got hurt.https://cleantechnica.com/2022/02/02/president-biden-hypes-ford-gm-evs-ignores-teslas-clear-leadership/
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 01:17:21'] I never realized how left wing r/stocks was.I mean I know it's reddit still but holy shit, it's still a stocks sub.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 14:02:48'] Maybe a bad press week, but the reality is this company is light years ahead of the competition.  The charging network is the strategic advantage - just as iTunes was (and now the App Store) is Apples strategic advantage.  Prior to iPod there were dozens (maybe hundreds) of MP3 players, but grandma wasn’t about to go to a Russian website for free music and then figure out how to get it on the device.  iTunes made it easy to get tunes and apps in one place and it just works with iPod/iPhone/iPad.  If you haven’t got an EV today, you have no idea what the difference is finding charging for an non-Tesla EV vs a Tesla.  With Tesla, I show up and plug in.  With other networks, I need a special app to find a charger, another app to start /pay for the charging, and (assuming the station actually works) I likely have to have an adapter.  It’s a major pain in the ass that Ford/GM/Toyota/etc won’t invest in until it’s much too late/expense to catch up anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:54:35'] I mean if dems stop buying Teslas, won’t that lead to surpluses and drop their value. I mean I don’t think anyone will buy them anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 21:46:51'] Unironically, #2 is by far most important for this list in terms of potential impact to the stock. Many mutual funds with large AUM deliberately use strategies to benchmark against the s&p ESG index by holding its constituents over or under- weight, so regardless they buy stocks in that index, because it’s in that index… just a feature of how the market is structured. Right now beyond that, stock is down along with other large-cap growth stocks (similarly to NVDA)I would still recommending holding TSLA because fundamentally the latest earnings have crushed ests and (ignoring any obvious optimism on timelines…) the FSD and enabling software are enormous potential value. You have to believe in the long-term value that Elon is passionate about for Tesla and look past the short-term noise, so long investment time horizon is important.

I won’t speak on the allegations because I would be a fool to act like I know if it did or didn’t happen, that’s for the courts to decide.Publicly taking a right wing stance is definitely a bold move, perhaps he’s trying to appeal to the right wing people? Maybe he feels Tesla is far enough ahead that he doesn’t have to worry about losing dem customers to “competition”, if you can even call it that.I personally feel the self driving tech is completely revolutionary and has the potential to bring in unimaginable profits via robotaxi someday. Plus solve the drunk driving issue that our government can’t fix.If musk really does lose it and go off the rails so be it. Are people forgetting this isn’t Tesla in 2014? They’re a massive corporation now. Completely established and profitable. Although Elon has taken the company very far, they don’t really need him. Think apple

Dont know if you saw it but today Musk is tweeting against the VERY REAL FACT that Trump and Putin are a duo and that Putin rigged him in in 2016. Musk is too smart to believe that Trump is innocent so he has started becoming a fascist, not just a republican. He is down with Bolsonaro in Brazil now, and it is NOT to save the rain forest it is to confab with a fellow fascist.  This neo fascism of Musk's also badly soils spaceX and would crater twitter if he succeeds in taking it over, but I bet they stop him now, then sue him for 20 billion.

POST_TEXT: b'In one of the most significant battery breakthroughs in recent years, the worlds largest battery manufacturer CATL has announced a new condensed battery with 500 Wh/kg which it says will go into mass production this year.\n\nThe launch of condensed batteries will usher in an era of universal electrification of sea, land and air transportation, open up more possibilities of the development of the industry, and promote the achieving of the global carbon neutrality goals at an earlier date, the company said in a presentation at Auto Shanghai on Thursday.\n\nCATLs new condensed battery will have almost double the energy intensity of Teslas 4680 cells, whose rating of 272-296 Wh/kg are considered very high by current standards.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 05:11:18'] Heat. Heat. Heat. Its always the problem with the current lithium ion technology and they are hardly been transparent with how they are managing this heat. How will they cool the battery (if with energy are the capacity gains nullified) and if they don't cool it what are the effects on longevity?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 14:22:09'] Remind me again how hydrogen will ever compete with batteries at this rate. The only advantage it ever had was charging time, density, and possibly reusability of construction materials. But these are slowly eroded away.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 05:51:42'] Unfortunately a high energy density isn't what makes a battery breakthrough. You could have a 10,000 Wh/kg battery, but if you can't make it at scale or for a reasonable $/Wh it doesn't mean anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 06:54:53'] Chinese companies announce all kinds of things. Very few of them are true. I will believe this when I see it in the real world.

Cash flow is increasing, sales are increasing and they have worked out how to avoid Uncle Sam's dementia. Despite the comments below I think they are leading the next step forward. Whats interesting is they've done it using standard Li technology and a new electrolyte. And what are the main risks? The next step change will be to use microcontrollers to optimize the power drawn from separate Li and Na batteries. This will get us another 20-30 per cent. After that we should be worried about polymer batteries but that seems 5 -10 years away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 05:08:20'] They've increased production a lot, so it makes sense that they'd be offering more incentives to move vehicles. Demand has probably weakened due to COVID measures too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 20:33:07'] I mean it's possible you will have a company rise from the grave like Apple. You have to remember what a big piece of shit that was until the first iPod and iPhone. Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 19:18:13'] I really believe the next huge sector will be genomics. Unfortunately, unless you have a PhD in biology and chemistry it seems like 99% of what I read is gibberish to me, also you’re really taking a gamble on who is going to win the genomic race although I would take a shot in the dark with BEAM, I have no positions currently. I only have one stock and that is Tesla, they’re already huge but I believe they will secure their spot for automation and AI training / ML in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 09:32:37'] Might be better to look at what the hot new thing might be.I hate to admit it, but possibly that's virtual reality stuff.  Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?Trouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.MSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.What you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?As for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 17:40:58'] The problem is that these stocks you listed, when they were “cheap”, was not the sure thing like they are today. Tesla at one point in time had continuous production delays, losses every quarter, and on the verge of bankruptcy. Investing at that time was risky. Elon himself said they were very close to going under. Any potential 10 bagger will have its own risks. I would recommend looking at some of the Chinese equities, jd for example. If things go right and regulatory fud goes away, could be a big winner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 22:28:06'] NVIDIA. I believe their work with AI and the massive head start they’ve had will make them a dominant force in the tech industry once AI begins to directly get into the hands of consumers. They’ve developed AI for self driving cars, have used machine learning to automate a lot of tasks developers, engineers and designers would normally have to do manually. The other day, I realized I could use the NVIDIA AI to reduce noise in my microphone, as well as upscale the resolution of games. While these are small applications that won’t convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction. Once self driving cars, automated traffic and smart factories become the norm, you can expect NVIDIA to be even more of a juggernaut in the tech industry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 06:54:01'] Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.My call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to "improve" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. "How is that possible?" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The "longest range" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.Also, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to "grow" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..In the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say "I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla"
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 07:38:29'] The best way to try and find this is start with a screen. 1) <$20 billion market capNext, what are the financial qualities of a "decade" stock? Revenue growth. This is tricky though since COVID skewed results both up and down but you will still have many companies. 2) 5 year annual revenue growth >20%Good balance sheet. None of the companies mentioned in the original thread ever had any material debt.3) Debt/MktCap < .2It is hard to get the list much smaller with quantitative measures without eliminating potential contenders.The nest step is really about picking the industry that will see the next winner.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 17:01:38'] I feel like “the biggest indicator to buying a Tesla is people who can afford it” is kinda a lame study. Obviously people who can’t afford them won’t be buying them.I bought mine in 2018, not because Of a ceo, not because of politics, but because I rarely drive far so an EV made a ton of sense as far as practicality (charging at home, relying on solar panels, etc) and coolness. Teslas are insanely fun to drive, I’ve never met anyone who disagrees, and at the time, they were really the only EV with any cool factor that are capable of driving faster than 55 mph.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 15:50:02'] Interesting. I'm not buying an EV from Tesla since I've long loathed Musk. I'm simply not a fan of man childs or internet trolls
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 18:02:52'] I’m quite centrist if I said so myself.The final push for me for ordering a Tesla was after my friend who worked at Tesla give me a ride in a completely max options with FSD plaid MX.I put in my order for MY around late 2021 and receive my MY recently. A few days after my delivery day is when fuel hits $6/gallon when Putin “declare war” on Ukraine.I’m guilty for feeling extra smug whenever I drive by the Costco gas center to go into Costco parking. I’m not making bank and buying a MY for commuting to work was a major investment for me. One factor is that my company offer free EV charger on company parking lot (I don’t have to wake up early to find parking spot) The best feeling for me is that I don’t have to spend $300 monthly on gas (before fuel hike) which probably cost somewhere around $500 to $600 in NorCal right now. Tesla definitely not just “liberal rich kids” toys (though MS and MX plaid options are pretty much rich kids toys) though you can go toe to toe with those muscle car even with regular M3 and MY.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:15:13'] The issues are far more broad than this. Tesla is priced as a company that’s going to dominate the vehicle market. Not as just a luxury car manufacturer. Openly alienating half the country isn’t the way to achieve growth. Especially if the half the country you’re alienating are the ones who actually believe in climate change and the need for moving away from fossil fuels.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 16:46:18'] Tesla is the first thing people think of when anybody talks about EVs.People that buy ICE cars like Dodge Demon are now starting to look at buying a Plaid because you can smoke million dollar hyper cars for $120k.Tesla software is miles ahead of anything on the market like the Ford MachE that has a hard time staying in between lanes on the highway with a curve.Tesla is becoming a luxury brand like Apple and soccer moms love showing off.Tesla invented the Plaid motor and the machine that is needed to build the plaid engine.Tesla has a solid demand and they are meeting the demand.Tesla insurance will be a cash cow.Tesla can't produce battery packs fast enough for states like California and Texas while so many others are signing up.Tesla stock is down just like every other stock is down in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 00:18:17'] Who gives a shit what his political opinions are? Here in the UK, the owner of the largest pub chain (Wetherspoons) is a complete nut politically speaking, and he's universally hated by the left wing/younger crowd. That doesn't stop the pubs being packed on a weekend though because at the end of the day they offer quick, reliable service, and cheaply as well.If the product is good enough, then people will come. Political stuff is just noise really. Just like this whole thing with Disney in Florida. Nobody (or at least very few will) *actually* boycott Disney if they like the content they're putting out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 15:44:06'] Based on your analysis, it seems like the market is capped out. Less and less people will be buying Teslas if the prices continue to increase as well as inflation continues. Upper middle class and the rich are a small part of the overall car buyer's market which Tesla looks to have pinned down. Putting all the politics aside, purchasing a Tesla without the credits and cheap recharging rates, a lot of potential buyers (lower income) will look at other options and the buyer's pool will stagnate or decrease.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 15:38:06'] 1. Making $100-200k doesn't make one rich.2.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 21:26:57'] Tesla demand is through the roof, so even if some would-be left wing buyers decide not to buy from Tesla because of Elon's tweets, it won't hurt sales. I don't think Tesla will face a demand problem for a long time, and if they do, they can simply start advertising.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 22:16:58'] I see people who buy tesla the same way people who buy lifted v8 6 foot bed truck.Both for differents reasons.One bought a car that average salary people should not buy. Thinking they will save massive money and camouflage their actual reason with arguments of performance and emissions.The other one bought a lifted truck and fitted it with massive tires for the show. While making the ride shit and the performance even worst. Never see a trail or work with it. Not all of them, I know. But since I work in a tire shop. I speak with a lot of people, I get the average of both groups when it comes to their "needs" as tires goes.Extra: a lot of people don't think before dumping thousands in a car. They flinch on a tire set over 800$ Can but dont realise they pay that every 2 months at best.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:50:02'] I live in Palm Beach County (RPB), was an Obama Democrat, switched to Libertarian to vote for Gary Johnson to legalize MJ now am registered to vote with no party affiliation. College degree +. Bought a used 2020 Model S, 6K miles,  w/Ludicrous mode and FSD Beta, so that will clue you to my income level. Married, no children, 50+ years old. Owned a 2015 BMW M3 bought new and shipped from Germany. That car needed over $15K of work (at 65K miles) to replace engine and transmission seals. The carbon fiber dash cover was melting up off the dash and coming loose in other areas too. The driver's side arm rest on the door had gone all gooey in back so you had to grab it carefully to close the door so you wouldn't get some sticky black crap on your fingers. Oh, and the iDrive Display was delaminating on the inside. Other than that, great car. I traded it for my Tesla which I purchased for the following reasons: 1) Takes off like a raped ape (I am proud to own a frickin' SUPERCAR!) and the technology that went into the car is amazing, 2) My wife liked the body style, paint color and wheel/tire size, 3) Didn't care about a test drive because we heard great things about Tesla's from acquaintances who owned different models that they bought years ago (early adopters), 4) Zero emissions, 5) I'm a bit of an Assburger myself and like Elon, 6) No gasoline, just plug it in, 7) SAVE THE PLANET! We do still have an ICE vehicle because we think it would be impractical to try to drive a Tesla up to Philadelphia and the Poconos (especially through S. Carolina and that stretch of VA between Emporia and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel).

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 17:27:33'] Anyone who buys a tesla is stupid from a practical pov. Unless you're leasing and continue to renew, never leave the city, it really isn't worth owning. They won't even sell you parts even if you buy one outright. Not even brake pads, even if you're a mechanic and more than capable of doi g the work. Also, everything can be controlled remotely, regardless of ownership status. If they wanna lock you out of your car for nay reason, they can just hit a button and permanently immobilize your car. The parts and limited range is what does it for me. I can't cou t how many times I've ran past my gas level and needed to get to a station asap. Imagine that when you're 20miles from a charging station or hm. Then you have to wait on top of that..

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:15:57'] Yeah I mean as a car guy the thing I respect most about teslas is that (at least originally) the value proposition was that you're getting a great car, that happened to be electric. The roadster had a tough time with that because batteries are very heavy, which made it difficult as a performance vehicle, but the application was niche enough and the acceleration good enough that it gained traction. Next market segment was luxury automobiles and this was a highly profitable market segment to penetrate (and apart from Elon's miscues surrounding his obstinance around the model X), because margins are still very high for luxury automobiles, but electric drivetrains offer a number of key differentiators along key criteria within the value proposition of a luxury car. First and foremost, they're quiet. Weight isn't as much of an issue because luxury car drivers typically don't desire the same number of lateral Gs as sports car drivers. Range isn't nearly as much of a concern in daily driving (especially for well heeled drivers who likely live near their place of employment) as it is for sports car drivers as well (who probably want to go balls out for 4-6 hours at a time around a track).Electric cars are more efficient from an engineering perspective if not for the pesky battery issue. I'm honestly kind of surprised there wasn't a "tweener" car with a gas motor powering a generator driving electric motors. Fisker had something along those lines but I think it was a complicated system where the engine could drive the wheels as well as the generator. I'm just talking here about replacing the battery with a small 1-cylinder gas or diesel engine. But at any rate, as someone who doesn't align very well with either side of the political spectrum (pro weed/hamsterdam from the wire really, pro choice, pro guns, pro "supply and demand" economics insofar as we recognize that behavioral economics is literally like the missing piece of efficient markets hypothesis and we need to approach legislation generally with the assumption that we're governing a bunch of coked up chimpanzees, pro globalization, pro \*obscene\* competitiveness in education, anti private company subsidies, federal government should be like the 50 states starting a gofundme for nukes, testing standards to prevent tainted alcohol, and hypersonic fighter jets), I can tell you that I respect the inventiveness of elon musk in his brand alignment of tesla. Would I buy a prius? I mean I drove one for a while for a job, it's fine, yeah if someone parked one in my driveway and said here's your complementary car, I'd drive it for sure. Nothing against the prius. But if I had $120k sitting around (refuse to take on that kind of financial obligation for what is a depreciating asset during normal economic times) I would buy a model S. I'd love to buy a cybertruck, but that's going to take a few years.I say all of that partially as a feeble attempt to demonstrate my intelligence to strangers on the internet, but also to say that I agree that there's not the same kind of hardcore brand alignment between greenpeace and tesla as there is between greenpeace and bamboo rickshaws.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:38:32'] Yeah, no shit. having enough money to buy one is really important. You wasted a lot of time on this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:39:36'] The fleet sales manager told me 85% Teslas were sold within 100 miles from its Fremont plant. Almost all buyers are high tech successful professionals.  As for the political affiliation you could have guessed where they are.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:50:22'] The real trick here is convincing everyone that having an opinion is inherently political. Everyone falls for it too, just read the comments. It really is a great time for PR. You can just convince some subset of the population that liking a thing will piss off another subset and they'll never stop liking it. It creates immediate and life-long brand loyalty. Because we live in a society of spite. It works out well because it keeps us from talking about the lithium fires or the poor safety features or the terrible AI software that's always 1 year away from functioning. Instead people are arguing about who belongs to what party and why that's the basis for brand loyalty.

On the other side, Elon is one of the richest people in the world and is the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world. So of course there will be Democrats that hate on him purely because of that. I do think that owning an EV is becoming less political though. With more car companies transitioning to EVs, I feel like owning one won’t be seen as a "political" statement like it was 5 or 10 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 21:56:27'] Yes. Most of this is common sense that most people should be able to pick up on. Every rightwinger I know)(including myself) would love to get a Tesla. I'm not financially ready just yet but sometime within the next 7 years would be nice.

That danger is gone. there are far more damaging companies with worse reputations and leaders who do just fine and grow despite all emotional opposition.It’s a numbers game and the least significant is stock pricing during a market downturn.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 04:16:18'] So what you're saying is that Elon Musk did the flip to grow his consumer base because there are more there that can afford his product? Sounds legit. There are a couple issues with the assumptions. Firstly, EV's are spectacularly heavy and to combat all that extra weight, "aero" or as it's also known as aerodynamics becomes a major function in the design. Therefore, styling becomes pretty universal and common between vehicles. Look at the similarities between the Tesla Model 3, the Porche Taycon, and the Toyota Miria. The hatchback models contain similarities. There's also no legitimate "Go Green!" being aired constantly across any radio station. HOWEVER... there is a constant drowning against EVs on conservative talk radio. Their main message, "Don't buy." Just turn on any FOX station to hear it.Lastly, there's the explosion of new EVs coming to market: For F150 Lighting, Rivian, GM Hummer EV, Ram EV, Chevy Volt, Volkswagen, Porche, BMW. Polstar, China BYD, Li auto, NIO, Xpeng. Therefore there are more and more choices for the consumer. Of course with all these new competitors, comes demand for raw materials: Lithium, cobalt, magnesium, aluminum, and more. These raw materials have skyrocketed in price due to that. Fortunately, advancements in battery technologies is under way. China, who seams to be cutting ties with Tesla in favor of their home grown companies (this is an interesting read btw) is developing sodium base batteries that are cheaper to make, recycle, and larger operation range. India is experimenting with Aluminum-Air batteries that you swap at "EV-stations" for a full charge in less than 3 minutes. Very interesting stuff really. Let's also not forget the Toyota Hydrogen Engines. When it comes to vehicles, the one to actually pay attention to is Toyota btw. Toyota is very conservative in terms of presenting reliable technology historically. Toyota is also constantly in contact with its consumers to engineer immediate improvements. Why? They do this from "lessons learned." You don't become the world's largest vehicle manufacturer by sitting on your hands. You do it by listening, learning, and improving. That's something that Tesla is getting a reputation for not doing. Just watch YouTube.So Elon Musk transition of his consumer base is an actual No-Brainer. Right now EV companies are in a race to be "the one." Tesla is loosing ground. To combat that, there's little to no choice but to try to appeal to a more higher dollar owning base.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 04:17:35'] You miss a key point. What has been driving Tesla’s stock valuation has been activist investors. These are people that buy regardless of price to force industrial transformation. It’s a new class of investor. And THEY are the ones that have and will abandon the stock once they realize that musk is no revolutionary but an opportunist. That his mission is to produce cash for himself not transform the auto industry. That it’s all a selfish ploy. And that he’s a selfish pig (that abuses women etc)… once that narrative expands, Tesla’s be  as brand will be destroyed and stock price will tumble. No one cares who buys Teslas. But everyone SHOULD care who buys Tesla stock!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 04:19:48'] It is utter stupidity to club companies in red and blue bracket based on thier CEO’s political view.And it will next level of craziness if someone factor’s in what musk says in buying Tesla. As long as tesla keeps on making good quality cars consumers keep buying it irrespective of thier political views. Climate change is real and deniers doesn’t represent all of GOP, only a small section of  it. Even in private everyone will agree to it but denying it is good politics so doing it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 04:26:34'] It's liberals isn't it.  This is gonna be hill areas.  Wonder if muskrat is singlehandedly trying to trigger the burst.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:28:24'] This world is weird nowadays. People factor in the CEO’s political party of choice to purchase a car. I personally don’t give a damn. If my car takes me from point A to B comfortably, i’m happy. Yall think too hard about nothing
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:34:29'] Tesla buyers are rich.  Not like yachts and Ferraris galore but very comfortable with large incomes who are relatively insulated from daily ups and downs.  I’m not sure why but I’d wager it’s because Tesla has a “on the cutting edge” image even if it’s quality is rather subpar.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:34:45'] > So Tesla buyers are rich.Even the Model 3 is a luxury car so I would expect that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:42:04'] This makes sense. DCA the stock from here on out for me. Even though we make good money, I could never justify 60K + on a vehicle. Don’t have that cash for a vehicle and don’t want to be on monthly payments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:53:41'] IT's really strange watching the tesla cult fall apart in the wake of Elon's repeated incompetence and pettiness.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 05:59:09'] If you’re household income is 134K and you’re buying a Tesla then you are not living within your means. That’s a poor choice to spend almost half your annual salary on a car.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:01:58'] I think he should be more concerned about losing out on subsidies. That’s what got Tesla on the map. If blue states aren’t buying them, they’re going to need more buyers in red states that don’t subsidize electric cars. They’re going to have to want them so much they’ll pay a premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:07:54'] I own TSLA shares but had never been in any of the cars before this weekend. My friend that works with a similar company rented a Model E for a convention we both went to. Gotta say, I was very impressed with build quality, features, layout, power, handling, sound system, on-board services, etc. We drained to battery down to 10mi of range but found a charger easily (I had been most concerned about charging times). We plugged in, rolled up a blunt, and watched Brandon Semanuk youtube videos on that big ass screen. Had a good enough time chilling at the charger that we had actually been fully charged for a bit by the time we decided to check what the status was. Definitely a very nice car.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:17:17'] I think the fact that this post exists is evidence of the brand dilution… the cool factor wears with the antics of Elon Musk. It is fine to vote democrat or republican that is fundamental. But, Elon Musk is now demonizing democrats and actively polarizing… while essentially saying the right hasn’t changed but the left is more radical.Elon’s brand equities are Tesla’s brand equities. And for a stock that is still valued at a crazy level, losing 10% of sales due to antics is risky. Marginal sales beat is what has propelled the stock, so when those beats start waning, the stock will likely take a beating. But, hey… world does seem to care less and less about fundamentals as long as you are willing to hate on your enemies. maybe the ICE crowd will decide they will buy Elon’s EVs more and offset.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:21:54'] Tesla have never been cool. It’s a car with a lot of cheap work around with the caveat of being fast (if you pay out the ass).Elon is cool so people buy his stuff
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:28:32'] I can tell you based on the guys I work with that Republicans are very much buying Tesla's.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:40:56'] Man. If democrats (or republicans) start making buying decisions because they don’t like the CEO they’re in for a rude awakening…
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 06:44:04'] Who gives a fuck, you want a car buy a car for it being good, not because you agree with the owners tweets? Stupidity is terminal yk
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 07:08:05'] > And lastly: “The primary motivator to buy a Tesla is not because customers want to reduce greenhouse gases, Edwards said. His data show performance and styling are the biggest draws for most buyers.”Well yeah, that's why Tesla has been so successful at selling EV's. The traditional automakers either made EV's they didn't really want to sell, or tried to make a car for environmentalists (see Nissan who literally called their EV the Leaf to symbolize how green it is).Tesla on the other hand made an EV for people who like the latest tech, and there's a lot of techies out there willing to pay big money for the coolest and latest tech.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 07:35:08'] I wonder how much of Elon's recent political conflicts will harm sales to Democrats (which appear to be about half of the buyers).I remember some brief issues with Yuengling and Goya over endorsing Trump but I haven't heard much about those affecting overall sales. Yuengling you can opt out of and go for an alternative beer fairly easily, but Goya has a lot of staple food products. Then there's stuff like MyPillow where it was more the corporate disendorsements of Mike Lindell that caused him to lose out on ad and shelf space.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 13:27:23'] One Twitter user backed Musk's idea, saying "what an opportunity," but another called Sanjay responded: "And sell another $20 billion worth of $Tesla stock. No thanks!"Sanjay's Twitter profile describes him as a "Tesla customer and investor, bull and Elon fan." Insider couldn't verify whether the user was a shareholder or the size of his holding.I've said it once I'll say it again, Twitter responses and conversations ARE NOT NEWS! Yahoo is terrible.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/yabqan/tesla_and_the_chinese_semiconductor_ban/'
POST_TEXT: b'A very large percentage of Tesla sales and suppliers are in China.  At the same time, a large number of functions in the vehicles use semiconductors that are no longer allowed to be shipped to China.  This seems like an extra sneaky Castro surprise that is not priced in yet.  What do you think?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 21:44:46'] The AMD chips used by Tesla are not part of the ban
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 23:08:24'] Which part of Tesla semiconductor is not allowed in China? The ban is not yet affecting consumer chips. It's mostly aiming at data center chips.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 03:13:51'] Source for this? As I understand it in a nutshell, it only bans high-end chips used for HPC and AI applications. Last I recall, the chips in a Tesla aren’t high-end, mostly consumer level use.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 22:03:08'] I don’t see Tesla buying all of their semiconductors and chipsets exclusively from China. Maybe in a component or few, yet not with any high level of exclusivity that would disrupt Tesla’s entire automotive manufacturing process across the globe.China’s semiconductor and chip business is considered 3rd rate compared to Japan being the first and the U.S. being second. It’s largely due to china not cracking down on corruption in the manufacturing sector. This corruption shows up in the quality of raw materials. Unscrupulous vendors will sell rare-earth raw materials that are diluted heavily with fake materials to make the raw materials seem normal. When in fact they could be diluted by 25-50%. This dilution is part of the reason China’s chips and semiconductors are not in demand compared to japan or other chip/semi conductor manufacturing countries. Taiwan even eats their lunch over chips and semiconductors.China has a reputation problem with their semi conductors and microchips.The primary reason why large companies like Tesla will not exclusively buy China’s semiconductors is because of the low Quality Assurance rates in the finished product. Due to the lack of quality raw materials, the components themselves have a significant reputation for failure. This is also the reason why Apple, (when they manufacture iPhones in China)ship all key semiconductor and chip sets for their phones to the China manufacturing plants and do not buy these materials directly from China. With would be far cheaper than shipping these components from overseas plants.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 20:25:49'] I feel if this were an issue it would have been addressed during the Tesla ER or the various Tesla analysts would have pointed it out by now

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 20:37:56'] I think the fact that it wasn't even mentioned one time during the earnings call tells you how big of an issue this isAlso, wouldn't this be a much bigger issue for someone like Apple who basically have all their iphones made in China?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 09:37:06'] The ban is actually the reverse: high end AI chips like the Nvidia A100 are already banned, the intention of the newer ban is trying to stop the Chinese from MAKING their own high end chips, which is evident in the pulling of American personnel from Chinese chip making companies. AMD, Nvidia and Intel can still sell high end consumer chips in China, and there is no indication that this will not be the case anytime soon. And the lower end aka over 28nm chips are not covered in the ban I believe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 04:55:59'] I think this forces chinese companies to open up in North America for manufacturing which is good thing under the supervision of US government.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 05:20:40'] Some critical board and chip set used by Tesla seems to have “made in USA” stamp based on those Munro video. If anything, I’ll say raw materials that used for cathode has higher chance from China but they are raw materials.Since China chip industry effectively kill over night if anything, those “Tesla killers” like BYD, NIO, etc. are among the first to go once inventory dried up since they copy paste Tesla used of chips (open sources) etc. But don’t let BYD fanboy like Gordon Johnson know about it.Surely it sting to cut of Tesla Shanghai but if we used 1/3 of total output of Tesla from Shanghai then their 23Q1 will see first impact but Tesla will still producing vs BYD whose production number might drop to 0 depend on their current inventory on chips. Will BYD used knock off chip for their EV or they just simply stop production after West Taiwan imminent invasion to Taiwan who knows.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 06:50:13'] I would be more worried about China realizing that the country with the largest semiconductor manufacturing is right off their shore and China already claims it. US ban might accelerate their plans, whatever they may be. It would entirely cripple US industry if something were to happen to the current status quo.

Combine that with established players sticking their head in the sand who are all going to lose market share. Combine that with a global warming crisis that the public is highly motivated to fix. Combine that with governments writing laws to push the transition. Combine that with a company that's playing a super long game, making massive R and D investments to create giant moats in several areas for their products. Combine that with the same company providing complimentary products and services that increase their revenue. Combine that with the same company vertically integrating to reduce costs and increase their technological lead. Combine that with the same company innovating on the production level to increase production speeds and further lower costs. And if all that weren't enough, combine that with the same company launching new products which will create new markets and open up even more revenue streams down the road. If you can't see what's happening, just walk away. Tesla is not a car company.

I whole-heartedly believe that if Starlink, Neuralink (Or whatever it's called) and Space X ever become public, $TSLA will completely tank and be brought down to "normal" levels. Not to mention his recent tweet proclaiming that he would donate $6B to end world hunger if the UN would just play ball and publish a way to do it. (Whether or not you believe that is up to you, but I think it's fair to assume that a non-insignificant amount of his followers do.)

If it ups the production x2 next year (which it most likely will), it will mean \~4 billion or even more per quarter. At current valuation it would make 50 PE (assuming 20 billion in operating income per year and 1 trillion Market Cap), which is less than say Nvidia, and like another x2 in production for Tesla will drive the PE down to 20-25 which is average on the market. And Tesla plans to x10 the production in 10 years. Also Tesla has much healthier finance, compared to others who have huge debts (like VW)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 05:03:42'] And the real winner of the EV war will be General Electric IMO.  Electrical engineer here, sat down to do some calcs as best I was able.  I confess I am not in the power business.  That said I came up with the demand of 30.9 GigaWatts to charge 14.2 million BEV's over a course of 7.2 hours.  30.9 GW is the entire capacity built in 2018.  I used datasheets of charging equipment and cars, and researched grid capacity and constructionSo by 2018's power construction rate, if they did nothing but support BEV growth, there would be nothing left to support society's growing power needs.Ipso facto new wind power and nat gas fired power plants must be built at a faster rate.General Electric and Siemens have a duopoly in capital equipment for power generation.  No EV maker has that for sure.Moreover, as a percentage of current sales, GE would receive twice the boost to its stock price vs Siemens.Don't let the nat gas turbine's use of fossil fuels fool you.  I think nat gas turbines will still sell.  The BEV people wanting the virtue signaling will be doing one thing, and the businesses doing whatever it takes to generate that power for a profit will be doing another thing.

Tesla sells every vehicle they produce so if they are not no 1 in some markets, its just a matter of time. Their operating margins are double than that of industry standard and only seem to be improving. Imagine what happens when giga Berlin and Texas Ramp. As far as competition goes, have you ever seen a VW or a GM electric vehicle They are disastrous in every way. They are more expensive for less range speed and features. And don't even get me started on their software. Do yourself a favour rent a Tesla for a week, and maybe then you will start to get it. its like when apple iPhone came along people like you kept saying keyboard is the future, or Nokia or blackberry will just copy them and kill Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 06:46:34'] Is this just a Tesla sub now, all I see are people hyped about Tesla (rare) or people complaining about how overvalued it is for one reason or another. Yeah, the company is worth a lot of money, they don't sell that many cars, they have supply chain issues, they have environmental issues, Elon Musk is an occasionally personable, usually intolerable billionaire. All of these things may or may not play much of a role in how investors view the stock. Buy it or sell it, most of all get over it, I'm tired of hearing about Tesla, probably mostly form people who missed out.

People with this mindset and viewpoint of the stock market are the reason it ping pongs all over the place.What are you doing for me right this second to make me more money.  No vision. No thought to the future, no understanding of strategy on any level.  Evaluating only on what are they executing this second.Tesla’s plan has never been just cars.  It’s the battery technology.  The charging station networks.  The car software. AI.  Automated driving. And on and on.  I’m not surprised at all that you feel it’s valuation is bonkers.  If I evaluated Apple on these same parameters I would come to the same conclusion.  Unreal.

I don’t understand why so many people come here and complain about Teslas stock price saying it doesn’t reflect fundamentals and so on. Yes, we know, and the people that have held Tesla the last year and have made a lot from it know this as well. Why is it that so many people fail to just go w the market, like it reminds of the post from last week that literally said “the market is wrong but I am right” LMAO.How many more posts are we going to see on this sub complaining about Tesla ?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 06:51:48'] Tesla is priced like it's invented EV's, FSD, etc, etc when in reality it's just one of the crowd. It's real skill is that it's exceedingly good at marketing what it does and making people believe it's somehow unique.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 08:51:00'] You will be suprised how much a cult following can pump a stock. Dont short it. Tesla could be the equivalent of enron and still be pumped to the sky its just how todays market is. Underlying fundamentals will be disconnected. It may not make any sense but with how the market is now it doesn’t need to. If someone is will to pay more for the shares then where we are it could most definitely go higher.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 08:53:33'] I don’t think Tesla is justifiable valued either. And the people who think that they and only they will lead the market from now until forever are just trolls. But for Tesla tulips, all that matters is that people think it’s valuable. It doesn’t need to match reality. It will go as high as people who don’t care about fundamentals will pay. So if you know people who wouldn’t mind dropping tens of thousands on one share, then it’ll get there eventually. But the people with real money decide the cap. I think 2000 is near top after quadruple stock split
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 08:57:39'] Haven't we learned that stock market isn't correlated to real life anymore? Pandemic hits, stocks drop then hit all time highs while people and economies suffer tremendously. GameStop, AMC, Tesla, whatever, is just run up by anybody with $20 and a smartphone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 11:36:49'] Comparing market shares or number of cars sold in specific countries is wildly misleading. Yes Tesla sales in China aren’t growing massively, but they don’t sell there cars that are made in China only in China like the two above them do. They export them all around the globe to every market. This is something that will become unnecessary when there new factories start to open up closer to the markets there sold in. Also comparing Tesla to other car companies is also very misleading. Ford doesn’t own almost every gas station, all there servicing, and even most of the production that goes into there cars, and even there insurance. Tesla isn’t priced like it is because it will take the place of other car companies but for its potential to disrupt everything to do with transportation. While I would argue that yes for right now the stock price is very high I don’t believe that it will never grow into it.

The market is irrational because people are irrational. When there's enough people collectively believing a certain narrative, that narrative becomes a kind of "truth."At some point, when other car manufacturers expand their line of EVs, Tesla stock is going to reach in inflection point. But at some point, Telsa could just outright buy a car manufacturer that actually generates profits and controls sizable share of the car market.

Contrary to the lazy media hype around Tesla, it's actually well behind the competition in so many of its future prospects.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 20:39:41'] I agree that the valuation seems unreal, but what isn’t factored into your analysis is retail. Who takes the biggest cut of any product chain? Retail. The other carmakers are producers and wholesalers. Products are subsidized at both wholesale and retail transaction points then the independent retail network  gets the vehicle transaction gross profit, any wholesale incentives, oftentimes pocketing the retail incentive as well through the “bargaining” process, and they take finance & insurance income. Following this, dealers earn on retail and wholesale parts distribution in their areas and on after sales service in their shops. ALL of that income belongs to Tesla, and that is just the pure automotive division. Most automotive retail is still privately held, so industry volumes are understated. [NADA](https://www.nada.org/nadadata/), the National Automotive Dealers Association, reports that in 2020 total dealership sales dipped back below $1T USD after three years above the trillion mark. They employ $1.1 million people and nearly all have independent contracts for advertising, computer systems and many other expenses, without economy of scale to bargain with. The average dealership nets 3.6% of sales before income tax. Imagine what they could do with fixed retail pricing, national buying power and without the concern of competing against other dealers of the same brand…So Tesla has insourced retail and at 1% of volume that portion of the business is worth ~$360M net per year conservatively - not considering the better margins and lack of inside competition. Further icing on the cake is that Tesla has also insourced design and manufacturing of most components, compared with anywhere from 30-100% being outsourced by other brands. (Yes, some vehicles are built 100% by a company other than the brand whose badge they bear - and not just the internal badge engineering we see from the big three) The fact that Panasonic builds Tesla batteries in dedicated plants in the US is notable, but still small potatoes compared to nearly every other brand. Traditional carmakers are really no comparison for this company, or any other new manufacturers that take on the insourcing model. Especially as some have begin to open-source some of the IP, the key benefits of sub-manufacturing diminish. Meanwhile, the outgoing heavy-hitters are locked in a death-struggle between unions, suppliers and dealers all refusing to give up their piece, which results in much slower progress and innovation in almost every facet of the business.These are just a few of the reasons speculation is more justified than first meets the eye. A trillion? Maybe not, but Tesla has just crossed over the break even point in 2019 and is ready to pass Ford in net income with a mere fraction of the volume. Right now their only limiter on profit is how fast they can produce more vehicles.

Also true is that I’ve stayed away for a long time now because I have consistently thought it overvalued and if I had just invested when peeps I know tried to get me to invest I would be pretty well off right now.

They like throwing around their marketing hype of "2 million real world miles driven" and "billions of simulated miles driven" but all of that ignored two key facts:(1) Waymo has experimented on a very limited set of roads. Maybe like 10 different cities, tops. Even if they actually did experiment with let's say an order of magnitude higher # of cities, Tesla gets millions of miles worth of driving data across almost every single place in the US every month. (2) reaching that stage 4/5 self driving requires a lot of precomputation - they essentially need to have 3D meshes/maps of all the roads they travel on, before Waymo can operate. Tesla, on the other hand, does not really need that, yet since it uses a pure CV approach.None of this guaranteed Tesla's sucess, but almost none of the competitors are a real threat either, yet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 01:54:53'] The biggest jerk I ever knew got tesla when it was probably less than ten dollars.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 05:52:32'] What I wonder though is how why there’s no mention of Tesla being a single car company against conglomerates. Your mention of just Volkswagen group cars includes cars from manufacturers under the umbrella (Audi, skoda, etc.). It might be that they have 25% share overall but they on their own are probably much closer in competition. Also with Tesla pushing towards a cheaper solution for everyday car purchasers it’ll heat up more. It’s pretty difficult to do business against someone undercutting you by 20k…or 80k or however much. Though I won’t deny that they’re overvalued, just like you said yourself Tesla is more than just a car company and it’ll be interesting to see how they move forward.

Tesla is a long term stock, thus so many things are priced in.  Investing in Tesla means you're looking 5-10 years ahead. Making "overvalued" posts on reddit means you're looking 30 days ahead. Be smarter.

Tesla also has other products. Supercharger network is going to be a huge revenue driver after they open it up to non-Tesla vehicles.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 08:41:05'] Yeah, you don't evaluate market cap on SALES.Cars sell for different prices and make different profit.If going by revenue, Walmart would be the largest company. Are you going to sell 1 billion $1 toy cars and say should be the largest company?There is also MARGINS and GROWTH.Tesla's operating margin of 14.6% and growing is substantially higher than Volkswagen's 4.5%.That means for every $100 tesla makes, they get $14.60 profit whereas Volkswagen gets $4.50So Volkswagen needs to sell $300 to make the same profit as Tesla.Next is the fact that Tesla is expected to grow at an average pace of 50% over a multi-year horizon.Compound $100 by 50% for 5 years... and you get $759, with stronger margins.$759 * 17% margin = $129 profitVolkswagen which has exactly 4.77 times Tesla revenue is making$477 * 4.5% margin = $21 profitTheir growth is flat, actually declined for previous yearIn 5 years Volkswagen's profit will still be $21.In 5 years Tesla's profit goes from $14.6 to $129Tesla right now is exactly 5 times larger than volkswagen, their profit in 5 years will be 6 times greater than volkswagen and if they're still growing the gap will widen

Im thinking about selling an insignificant amount of shares and buy puts to hedge. \n\nHere are some of my concerns:\n\nThey miss due to delivery miss and this lower guidance since the markets have been spooked due to the amount of exports and the China recession perhaps this could be priced in but theres no way of knowing. \n\nThey beat and announce a share buy back and they maintain their guidance however if its very good and the stock rises, i feet that the big man will use it as an opportunity to offload shares for his Twitter acquisition :/ huge overhang. \n\nPerhaps they beat on every aspect and we get a rally in the stock for whatever reason.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 15:35:09'] Even with the “miss” in deliveries the still had a 42% increase in deliveries, earnings should reflect this.There’s more evidence that Elon doesn’t need to sell than the other way around.It’s already dropped ~30% very recently due to lots of reasons, company future forecast is not one of them. Bc if this I think it’s primed for a rally.But bc of market conditions, I definitely wouldn’t be buying calls.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 21:55:30'] Timmmmmbbbeeeerrrrr. Probably, I don't believe their supply has been that great. Decent orders but manufacturing is what's taking the hit, so payment doesn't start until delivery takes place. The purchases may have been made, but basically they're sitting on a bunch of IOU's. Once the supply fully recovers that quarter will be a good one for callsEdit: it's still a cheaply made car. The technology is great, main display great, but the materials on the interior whether it's a loaded S or an entry level. It's poor materials.I truly believe if we can see tesla join with a major car manufacturer they would explode. Bigger resources, bigger facilities all over North America.  It'd improve car quality and make it worth the stupid prices

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:13:40'] 1) They will take a huge hit on FX.2) They will likely meet or slightly miss this quarters expectations. I do not expect a huge beat; they need to not waste money on pie in the sky robots.3) Im thinking their forward guidance, which will matter more than just their balance sheet, is going to be pretty shitty (or, at least it should be) - they may try to Musk it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 18:44:42'] By the time earnings is out I think a beat will be priced in resulting in a dip the following trading day
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:34:58'] You’re late to the game bud. Wall Street has research teams that use Satellite imagery on cars moving in and out of factory to predict the delivery miss. Hence the 30% drop in the recent weeks. Twitter stuff has been priced in as well if you check out Twitter price, the deal has a 95%+ expected rate of going. Twitter wouldn’t be worth anywhere near $50 in current market condition of social media companies. You need research teams with Satellite imagery and top lawyers to be playing this game. The only retail investors I think should buy options are those who understand the underlying technology of Tesla and competitors at a fundamental and all the engineering levels as well as macro- even then a leap call is dangerous.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 02:05:15'] Mercedes who have taken the stance that they are ~~not interested in making long range cars~~  not interested in the development race for range as they believe that improvements in charging technology will eliminate this problem. So where has this come from? I have a theory that range figures are the new power figures, everyone always wanted the fastest and most powerful car right? Now all of these EVs are extremely fast so they need a new champion. Is range the new marketing kingpin?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 00:11:49'] Cool from a technology standpoint, but I couldn't care less cause it's still a prototype. You can compare a prototype with a reall mass production car.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 22:06:13'] A prototype….
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 03:18:32'] Another thing to note is “The car’s battery features a new chemistry”… They didn’t just load more batteries than Tesla, but it’s more efficient battery and powertrain that could drive 8.7kWh/100km, where Tesla is 14.9kWh/100km. That’s a big gap…
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 22:21:52'] Prototypes are usually better than what consumers get. Until it’s a finished product that can actually be bought the numbers don’t mean much. Might as well triple the battery cells and claim it’ll go 3,000km/charge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 02:07:28'] Prototypes are not worth looking into too much, the technology used is likely to be very expensive. Therefore unlikely to be suited to mass production for the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 09:46:09'] It doesn’t “outdo” Tesla.  It’s a prototype.  Tesla could easily make a prototype that goes this far in probably a few days.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 22:36:00'] At what cost tho
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:47:31'] NIO already accomplished this...
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 22:50:02'] Tesla could have done a vehicle with far higher range and performance. The problem is they are focused on achieving mass EV production. These higher range vehicles require a different battery chemistry with many using cobalt. It wouldn't be sustainable to manufacture these en masse. If the goal was to produce a 1000 mile range EV, Tesla could have done it. But who are the customers? Average driver drives under 50 miles per day, total. There isn't a huge demand for 600 mipe range EV's.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 23:57:20'] Hopefully this will motivate Tesla to build cars with better build quality. They have a great product but their build quality is subpar
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 01:45:38'] From a consumers perspective, nobody needs 1000km range. Maybe in a truck if you want to make those evs aswell. But consumer cars? For most people 400km range is more than enough and you would need to charge it once a week.The charging is the actual challenge. Here in Germany space is limited. Having a private parking space for your Car is expensive and in many places impossible. In other words. We got the range and fast charging figured out, we need a solution for the mass to charge their cars at night or during work/shopping.There will always be one dude claiming he drives 2000km a day at 200km/h average with a 2 ton trailer behind him.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 05:24:59'] I have a model 3 Standard Range, with like 175 highway miles of range.There are chargers every 75 miles in any direction. It's not a limitation in technology to reach 600+ miles, it's a realization that it's not needed, so why pay for so much. Maybe the mass market version will have less.Also, this 99% has a smaller frontal cross sectional area, meaning:way less effort to push it through the airway less space for comfort and storageAt their 8.7 kWh/100 km, they much have a 87 kWh battery?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 06:29:47'] Tesla isn't trying for maximum range, they are trying for the maximum amount of vehicles. They would much rather build two cars with 40kv batteries that get 290 miles of range than one car with an 80kv battery that gets 580 miles. Looks great on paper and for bragging rights but their mission is to get us over to sustainable transportation. And doubling the amount of cars they can make a year is a higher priority than super crazy ranges that few will actually need.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 11:51:52'] Here we go - I've been predicting that the major manufacturers were going to easily pass Tesla and, now that they're all starting we're seeing it.  Tesla just had the benefit of being the only game in town while no one else cared to play.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:00:38'] I'll believe it when they can scale it past a fancy concept
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:03:07'] This makes me imagine an electric version of the Volkswagen XL1. They can make far more efficient cars, but refuse to do it. :/
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:25:48'] Too bad its a prototype that will never turn into something real without a ton of compromises and eventually only have a range half

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 14:01:50'] So Lucid recently broke this single charge range record (as far as the articles I read about said) at 520mi, and then a couple months later mercedes has one that does 620?! Ngl I’m a little skeptical.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 04:20:21'] It's so weird to me that this makes headlines.. It's not like Tesla couldn't make a car with longer range, but the question is; at what cost? What do they have to sacrifice to make it go further, and how much higher will yhe consumer price get? Tesla obviously doesn't think the longer range is worth it, hence not making them go further.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 05:15:55'] Uses some strange silicon battery that won't be in a sellable car for ages. Good exercise in seeing what's possible though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 05:31:35'] for how long? Any boasting about how long a battery lasts is only hampered by its life cycle. The benefits means nothing unless you are able to replace it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 07:18:48'] I remember reading somewhere  that Mercedes was an early investor in Tesla back in 2009.They bought significant percentage of the company as a way to exchange technologies since by then Mercedes was fully developing ICE and they wanted to cooperate with someone having fresh thinking in a technology that could be the future.They sold all their shares in 2015 after their realized that Tesla mentality was completely different from theirs. Maybe those 6 years of cooperation were the seeds for the current EV of Mercedes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 07:27:37'] Tesla is a tech company that makes cars. Auto manufacturers will be better at making vehicles. I think that experience matters a lot more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 12:29:17'] There is a tax incentive for customers to take delivery next year because of revisions to the tax credit law.  They are trying to keep customers from delaying deliveries from December until January for that reason.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 12:18:36'] It’s an incentive for customers to take delivery before jan 1, when the new EV tax credit law goes into effect. The very first google search for “Tesla discount” explains this…
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 14:03:31'] TSLA investor here. China demand is an issue. But it’s a bit misleading. They’ve retooled the Shanghai factory to increase production. But the increase in production hasn’t been met with an increase in demand. But if China pivots away from zero covid there could be a big increase.The US has the IRA coming in Jan 2023, so why would the consumer buy now when they could wait a month for a discount? Because of this, Tesla chose to add the discount in early at their own expense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 12:52:21'] OP trying to push an agenda is what it seems like.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 13:59:33'] As others have said, it’s about mitigating delivery delays as people look ahead to the tax incentive. Remember, they’ve had to block orders for model 3 LR very recently due to excessive order backlog (block started 9/12), and model Y production is massively increasing. Disclosure: I’ve never had direct Tesla stock exposure, and don’t have plans to at this time. I drive a model 3 LR, ordered the day before the cut off.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 00:16:30'] Here in israel in a very different market Tesla had huge demand but last month  they had a shipment and  suddenly they can’t sell all the carsHere the reason is the cheap Chinese  electric cars. They took the market and there are too many teslas to be considered unique and be  a status symbol. So no sales lately
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 13:20:23'] Do I understand Tesla sells just about every eV produced in Shanghai and US has some inventory surplus?

POST_TEXT: b"The new Inflation Reduction Act extends the $7500 electric vehicle credit to all cars made in the USA with no cap. This Tesla's cars are again eligible. However there is a price cap. For a compact car the price must be under $55k. For an SUV it must be under $80k. Also if you make over $150k single or $300k married you are not eligible.\nDo you think this will impact Tesla sales in the US?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 10:10:51'] The base model 3 uses LFP batteries, which, as of now, use Chinese cells (and probably use minerals that aren’t sourced from a free trade country), so they probably won’t be eligible. The Y would be eligible though. Built in NA is just one component of the credit, the credit is broken down into $3750 for mineral sourcing of batteries, and $3750 for battery component sourcing (both on a sliding scale of % over time).
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 18:01:25'] Won’t the manufacturers just raise the prices after the tax credit goes into affect? Not a political comment. Just curious how this usually plays out

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 10:16:09'] I don't think it will impact their sales much.1. They can only sell as many cars as they can produce. There is currently a limited supply of Teslas, so currently there is a very long waitlist. If more people want to buy Teslas, the wait list will get longer, but sales will stay the same because Tesla can only make a certain amount of cars.2. The only Model 3 that will qualify for the credit it the RWD Model 3 due to the price cap. But even that probably won't qualify because RWD Model 3s have LFP batteries made in China, so it won't meet the 40%/50% battery qualification.3. Model Y starts at 66k. That meets the 80k requirement, but that's still very expensive. Only very well-off people will be able to afford it, but there is a $150k income limit. Meaning the target market for Teslas will most likely not qualify for the credit.4. Fed tightening will almost certainly cause economic pain, meaning a cutback on household spending, including on expensive Teslas. People making under $150k a year and buying Teslas certainly won't anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 13:09:56'] Can anyone explain how the tax credit is received? Does it show up via tax returns? Or will I see a $7500 check sent to my bank account
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 16:16:37'] Tesla also announced they will increase in price due to inflation, so I'd say it's negligible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 18:53:57'] They are about to raise the price to $54,999
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 17:19:45'] The only thing that matter is production, tesla or not. Every single EV that gets made will be bought instantly for the next 5 years (with some exceptions, you’d have to be brain dead to buy a bolt at this point)With that said, legacy auto will continue to drop in sales y/y until they actually ramp EV production to millions/ year. And tesla sales will grow every year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 11:16:47'] I believe Tesla will raise prices accordingly as they will absorb part of the benefit of the credit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 16:46:19'] Everyone makes a big deal about tax breaks, but are they really that helpful?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 10:41:14'] The EV tax credit doesn't apply to every EV. There are conditions that must be met such as where the minerals are sourced, a large % of the battery components must be made in North America, final assembly in North America, etc.,Right now, only GM and Tesla have hit that 200k EV tax credit from years ago. The rest of the industry is not focused on pushing EV's as much as they should be doing. The biggest issue for Tesla isn't the tax credit right now. It's getting more production out. Very few EV's qualify for the $7,500 credit at this moment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:18:58'] When the internet bubble happened, was it because internet was a fad or bad idea? No, it was a bubble regardless. Valuations were absurd, and most companies simply said "internet" without a clear idea how to monetize and add value - this resulted in no earnings.Bubbles are visible when all other sectors are flat or negative, and one is standout. Everyone floods the one sector. All it takes is some bad news or one or two of the stocks in the only up sector to get a 'surprise' bad news, or for a few large firms to finally take profits that it pops. This is the scenerio we have now with 10 stocks being 30% of S&P and 60% of Nasdaq. It doesn't matter that they are 'good companies' that will exist for 30 years and ride out any rough times. When valuation "doesn't matter" and "it will go up so i don't care" with only one sector holding it up that you have RISK. What is your RISK in your portfolio?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:29:48'] Technological progress has \*literally\* always been the growth industries. The problem is identifying what \*exactly\* is technology. That's the trouble - technology increasing productivity, which increases output, which if widely adopted, increased overall GDP. The key to economic growth for the past 200 Years has been technology.The trouble is in predicting exactly what the will drive the next productivity growth. Personally, Metaverse is out. Meta and its hundreds of billions spent on its shit Metaverse will go down in MBA classes as an example of a company  that completely failed to capitalize see market trends.Apple, I'm optimistic. Lots of shit is given to its Vision Pro to being nothing truly revolutionary, but neither was the iPhone. Also, its a hell of a lot better version of the future than Meta.Neither is really a technology that increases productivity overall within the economy. That honor belongs to AI. AI is the future. AI will drastically increase productivity and will revolutionize industries. ChatGPT is the 1990's Internet. Whether OpenAI is the AOL of the AI is anyone's guess. But, seriously... AI is the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:07:09'] Valuation matters though. Depending on when you buy some tech stocks you may underperform the market or even a savings account over a long period of time even if that tech company does well. CSCO comes to mind for example as a good company that had a certain time where buying it was a horrible decision because of valuation.Also, it is really hard to predict which tech companies will thrive and even survive.One rule I have read with tech is to invest in the companies that will benefit most from the technology, not the company that developed it. I think with the AI craze that is something to keep in mind as it’s entirely possible that some AI product might end up being used by a dinosaur company or otherwise non-sexy stock to drive huge growth.

Just cause "tech is the way" doesn't mean that Cisco Systems will live to see that way come to fruition or beat out all its competitors or continue to make products that consumers will buy.  One still has to pick the right tech companies that will yield the growth you speak of. Same goes for ETFs and sectors. You can't eliminate risk by virtue of "tech is the way".

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:26:41'] I feel like there’s literally nothing that can happen to  make SPY go any substantial amount upwards or downwards from 410. Good news, bad news, so much stuff has happened recently yet SPY pretty much doesn’t move at all in either direction. Feels like nothing matters anymore until the Fed cuts rates again

Only sticking to stocks now, specifically established companies throughout multiple sectors that don’t include indexes (those will be my first investment and makeup around 50% of my portfolio). Any suggestions would be welcomed. I’m gonna slowly invest over the next couple of years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 12:56:58'] Q1 Earnings Call: "We consider the company to be **criminally** undervalued, and we're focused on buying back shares. We believe the best allocation to shareholder returns is still repurchasing shares." Q4 earnings call: "Any sizable M&A, I mean, naturally, we're always -- I think we said before we have a door is always open approach to smaller bolt on things, but I think right now generally speaking, we're the main acquisition we're focused on is acquiring more off of stock."Can you guess the ticker?Find yourself an executive who loves their stock as much as Andy Eidson. Who bought back $10 per share in Q1 [This means if all buybacks were instead returned as a dividend, you would get $10 per share, or a 6-7% yield on top of the existing $2 or 1.3% dividend].

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 12:54:18'] I’m sure SPY will reach ATH again someday, but I wonder if the expectation of 7-8% average annual gains in the long term will still hold true going forward? Remember that 7-8% average annual gains are nominal, not real. If interest rates stay at 5ish %, why risk losing money in the stock market for a paltry additional 1-2% potential gain? And if enough people think that way then money is just gonna pour out of equities
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:00:11'] Off topic. Why did that PutsrNotDaWay or whatever guy get banned? On topic: What is the sentiment on MSFT? Have we seen most of the gains there for the year? Or is there catalyst for further highs?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:57:36'] Decreasing inflation isn't getting us out of this. Steady employment isn't. Beat earnings isn't. An expected rate pause isn't.It doesn't seem like there is anything that will turn this back up and "good" news is barely keeping us steady.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:35:09'] Nothing bad happened today, yet the market’s behaving like something’s wrong. So the markets are leaning towards the belief that today’s postponement of talks indicates that talks have broken down concerning the debt ceiling?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:53:58'] These seesaw market movements for the past year or so are getting tiring.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 19:35:53'] This might be stupid but let's see. Is there anyway to know how much money was invested in stocks last year during the downturn compared to now. It seems everyone is hoarding cash or parked in treasuries/money market funds waiting for the next crash whereas last year this wouldn't have been the case with the lower yields. I don't see how we can have any sort of meaningful crash when there is so much money on the sidelines waiting. Are people really waiting for SP 3300-3500 to jump back in. It seems any dips we have from here will have so much buying pressure with all the cash waiting on the sidelines. At what point do people start fomoing when the market is dropping.Cramer is even saying to keep some cash and wait for a drop from the debt ceiling. If everyone is doing the same thing is it really going to happen?It seems like if this debt ceiling gets resolved and the FDIC came out and stopped short selling against banks or guaranteed deposits this market could take off. With so much money on the sidelines I could see a massive fomo rally.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:01:14'] A lot of people are saying we are in a bubble, and since everyone is piling into big-tech when one of the big boys sell-off it will create a cascade, which is possible, but I want to point out that if you look at SEA, ROKU, MTCH, SQ, COIN this irrationally lasted over a year from COVID lows until Nov 2021. Big-tech can continue going higher for longer, and META, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT are also better ran and have a moat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:07:45'] Something I don't understand...Retail gas was at it's lowest ($3.20's national avg) in late dec / early jan.

POST_TEXT: b'I came across [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/chatgpt-can-decode-fed-speak-predict-stock-moves-from-headlines#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall?leadSource=uverify%20wall?leadSource=uverify%20wall) on Bloomberg that talks about how ChatGPT can analyze financial news and statements and generate insights and predictions for investors such as:\n\n* Interpret the tone and sentiment of Fed officials and central bankers and gauge their policy stance\n* Extract key information from earnings reports and company announcements and assess their impact on stock prices\n* Generate natural language summaries of complex financial data and trends\n* Answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises\n\nThe article also mentions some examples of how ChatGPT performed on some recent headlines and statements, such as:\n\n* Fed Chair Powell says economy is at an inflection point with stronger growth ahead\n* Tesla reports record deliveries of 184,800'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 15:39:45'] Headline traders and quant firms have used algo's in this way for some time now. They search for key phrases in the text of press releases or FED statements and trigger buy/sell programs based on predefined parameters. Chatgpt is the next iteration of that, I guess, and will probably result in more accurate, faster interpretations.In general, Central Bank releases are repetitive and structured in such a way that they are easy for the market participants to digest. I could see Chatgpt being more useful for earnings reports of individual stocks where there's more nuance and interpretation to the figures.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 16:49:28']   I wouldn't trust ChatGPT. I asked it two questions about my tax return that I'm now finishing, and it got both questions wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 17:53:58'] I do this with my brain
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 17:52:57'] > They used news after late 2021, a period that wasn’t covered in the chatbot’s training data. > In an example about whether the headline “Rimini Street Fined $630,000 in Case Against Oracle”Interestingly, Rimini street v. Oracle is actually pre-2021 data as shown by this wiki page that the case originates from 2019:[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimini_Street_Inc._v._Oracle_USA_Inc.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimini_Street_Inc._v._Oracle_USA_Inc.)Still a nice result.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 18:43:54'] its not that hard, Powell has literally said "im going to raise rates"... everytime they raise the rates. its just subs like this that believe the majick of their own farts will power a rate cut while inflation is above 3%
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 18:48:58'] You believe the headlines? 😂
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 18:52:07'] The issue I think is that if the vast majority of investors move in the same direction then there’s bound to be inefficiencies in the market. I think it will be helpful to play with more information but you still wouldn’t be able to predict the movement on a consistent manner.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:05:37'] Look, I've been long years in this business as a quant and professional asset manager. All i can say is that AI will not do much in stock market prediction. Most of the time, stock market (adjusted to long term growth) is moved by randomness. It could probably help average joe to cope with some behavioural biases and tell that based on statistics with, lets say 50 years data, at one time or another, it is better to hold more stocks in portfolio than usually.For example, if msci world is down from peak more than 30%, change default 60/40 or 80/20 allocation to 80/20 or 90/10 etc. Pure and simple.If it will generate signals based on some random technical analysis (which only works in the books) then its results also generate random outcomes. It's like predicting NBA game score based on some cloud formation two weeks ago. Sometimes it will tell the winner, sometimes even the score will be close. But it is just randomness.If there were any robust, significant and sustainable advantage where AI could regularly predict next hour, next day or next week stock market outcome, it were already implemented somewhere. Look at hedge funds and banks. Those bastards regularly fail to predict if market will be up or down next year.Why Google should burn money in some hardware like mobile phones production if their quantum computer can forsee the future? Just put cash in to stock market with leverage and bob is your uncle.Problem is, short term market is mostly random and long term history has not enough data points to train AI correctly.It will generate brilliant pictures with pope in puffy jackets and detect cancer from medical scans no problem. For everyday investments it will be just a resume of info you can find in the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 15:38:44'] Is this interesting to people honestly? Half the world is blown away by this and then there’s me like, wow….lame. Maybe I’ve become a boomer>ChatGPT came closest to humans in figuring out if the central bank’s statements were dovish or hawkishIt came closest to humans? As opposed to…Monkeys? Zebras? Dogs or cats? The three examples are so basic I would be blown away if it could NOT do that. It knows basic terms, so of course it knows beating delivery estimates is a positive for the stock, mind blowing!! Its spitting out generic answers, the same I a reader could generate by reading those same sentences no?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 19:02:12'] Fed optimism is good for the market, Selling more cars means more revenue, Share issuances are dilutive. Gee, thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 06:26:42'] > The article also mentions some examples of how ChatGPT performed on some recent headlines and statements, such as:>“Fed Chair Powell says economy is at an ‘inflection point’ with stronger growth ahead”“Tesla reports record deliveries of 184,800 vehicles in Q1 2023”“GameStop announces $1 billion stock sale plan”ChatGPT gave some interesting responses, such as:>“Powell’s statement suggests that he is optimistic about the economic recovery and expects inflation to remain under control. This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.”>“Tesla’s delivery numbers exceeded analysts’ expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla’s stock price could rise on this positive news.”>“GameStop’s stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop’s stock price could drop on this announcement.”Wow - thank God we have AI to decode those absolutely cryptic statements.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 22:10:56'] Yall....I had my first training on ChatGpT yesterday and my mind is ***blown***!!!  And I gotta admit, it's amazing, frightening, outstanding, and terrifying all at the same time!!Shortly before taking my class, I'd read an article on Vice about the computer generated swatting service called "Torswats," wreaking havoc across the country.  With the sophistication of Chat GpT, I can only hope there are some tech geniuses, somewhere, working to mitigate the power of evildoers who will seize upon the opportnity to use Chat GpT to fine-tune the devastation they're already creating thru A.I.Chat GpT is a game-changer in more ways than you can shake a stick at, both positive and negative.I hope to learn it well enough that at least one of the books I've been incubating in my spirit since forever, will finally see the light of day!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 18:46:50'] Chatgpt suggested that an indicator for a bad "buildings report" could be decline in building permit applications, reduction in comstruction spending, increase in construction costs, increase in new construction starts, increase in vacancy rates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 20:56:00'] Even AI trying to fuck over GameStop stock…still bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 21:54:12'] What’s brutal about FedSpeak is that lately they’ve been pretty direct. Often they arrive quite late to the fact. But they are direct…The market just focuses on insane things it wants to hear and ignores the rest. Maybe this is a spot you want a reader without so many emotions and biases.Fabricated example:Fed: “While we have seen some progress toward our inflation target, it is far above where we were aiming for at this time. We will continue to tighten until it is down to our target. We will not let up until this is met.”What market hears: “We will stop raising rates when we hit our inflation target… we have seen progress toward our target… [we will be lowering rates soon.]”Just a contrived example, but, that’s happened plenty of times since the 70’s when Fed announcements became a big deal. Probably even happened to some extend back in the 1910’s, but, different thing back then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 23:54:04'] I think the views shared here are driven by dogmatic views either for or against ChatGPT - at the end of it all, it’s a tool. The same way algo’s are a tool, sure people can and do think for themselves but this tool is meant to increase efficiency and at that job… ChatGPT is helpful. Is it perfect? No. It’s just a tool. A hammer is not a screw driver, expecting it to be a screw driver is… poor judgement on the human side
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 00:37:32'] What a shocker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 01:53:46'] Oh. So it has basic financial literacy and also just regular ass literacy. Cool.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 03:36:39'] Op, ever wonder the misdirection and move mid speech? Or the commuted move seconds after a statement comes out? This my friend is the algos parsing through text or speech to zero in on key words to direct their trades. Been around for some time now, chatgpt just adds fancy context.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 03:50:07'] Let me get this straight. Tesla beat expectations and delivered much more than expected and AI predicted that the stock MIGHT go up? Ubelievable! Truly revolutionary.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 03:57:06'] read the paper a few days ago, but isn't the sample size of 50,000 headlines or smth they tested still way too low? also the resulting gains were miniscule

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:25:04'] As far as accuracy is concerned, Chat GPT is going to run into the same limitations that any researcher, strike that, human researcher, runs into: information is tainted coupled with the difficulty of disseminating truthful information versus either marketing sway or political/corporate sway/speak.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 11:35:35'] There was another AI called "Caesar" it did ok during corona because all it had to do was to be bullish and leveraged. As soon as the market became complicated the AI completely failed and its creators stopped releasing videos with its AI voice predictions for weekly index performance. If brainless zero IQ AIs like ChatGpt that fake intelligence become a factor then it would be easily twarted by all the scam headlines and AI generated articles that have little hold in reality and pester the internet already. Even many "authoritative" established stock market newspapers make gross mistakes in their writing. The last article I read about Nvidia forgot a 1 in front of the PE ratio and underreported PE by more than 3x less than actual PE. Terrible. Plus any fool could just start mass releasing spam articles (like they do already) aimed at fooling AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 12:46:56'] Reducing the ambiguity of information in the financial sector is definitely a plus
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 13:36:22'] I don't get how when it's trained to data up to Sept 2021?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 20:48:36'] I have been saying this for the longest time.. they will use this capability of A.I to control human sentiment. Now, considering how fractured the world is that could either unite us by always sending the best possible and clearest, unifying message on a subject. Or…more likely, it will ensalve us all. We should just ban A.I like in Dune.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla, the world\'s largest producer of electric cars, has raised the price of its vehicles by thousands of dollars in just the past two weeks as the cost of raw materials like metal has skyrocketed.\n\nThe listed prices of several new Tesla models climbed Tuesday, according to the company website, compared to the prices from March 1. Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted earlier at why prices are rising, saying in a tweet Sunday that the company is "seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials and logistics."\n\nRead the full article: [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-raises-prices-electric-cars-inflation/#:\\~:text=Electric%20car%20maker%20Tesla%20is,from%20%2462%2C990%2C%20Reuters%20first%20reported](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-raises-prices-electric-cars-inflation/#:~:text=Electric%20car%20maker%20Tesla%20is,from%20%2462%2C990%2C%20Reuters%20first%20reported).\n\n**Tesla TSLA is down 3.24% in premarket trading after it was reported that the EV maker had increased prices on i'
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:10:21'] Didn't they just raise prices a couple months ago?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:03:57'] Elon kept saying how he will make tesla’s more affordable really hasn’t been delivering on his statement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 09:05:53'] Their demand is simply off the charts. Average wait times have increased from 2-6 weeks pre-COVID to up to 40 weeks now. Meanwhile their margins have gone from negative to Ferrari-like margins while all the other OEMs' sales are in decline as well as their margins. Tesla is wiping the floor with every single automaker in the world, and there's no sign of it slowing down any time soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:26:15'] If (!) they can hand down the price hikes in raw materials to their customers - good for them.Otherwise it will eat into their margins which were pretty impressive so far.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:43:32'] They raise prices all the time. Remember when they promised a 30k car? That thing last a week or two. When you have crazy demand you can do whatever you want with the price. You want to increase in the hope people walk away and you demand and supply curves meet at the perfect point.Every year it goes up more and more. The key thing is they don't increase the price for people that have already ordered, so existing demand remains, but future demand slows. They can always cut prices later if they want more demand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 10:10:11'] Tesla is interesting, I don’t think it should be traded based on fundamentals.  I think it’s more like a crypto currency at this point where it’s valuation is based on… it’s valuation.  I think Tesla sales are in for some trouble.  Elon musk being a very public figure and his political alliance is likely going to alienate his customer base.  This might be an incorrect assumption, but his cars being a luxury name that appeals to climate conscious people are also likely the same people that would be ideologically opposed to his politics.  Increasing interest rates and prices are not going to help.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:30:46'] I’m still holding for the long term. Tesla will always be mentioned whenever EV cars are brought up in conversation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:52:03'] TSLA is down 3% because the market is down and TSLA usually trades at a 2 delta.This news is bullish/neutral - Tesla will still sell every car they make for the next decade, and rising prices for their increasing costs means they are protecting their profit margins.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:28:33'] I don’t like Tesla products personally, I see the interface as polarizing and often disliked, I see manufacturing problems with panel gaps and paint issues. I think once other manufacturers catch up (already close) Tesla will lose their veneer and market share. Does it have a cult following? I’d argue yes, it’s almost akin to how people are loyal to apple. They put blinders on and over pay. I’d be neutral on the stock. I’m very interested to see if they can remain viable long term as a car manufacturer. Their inability to bring to market light and heavy duty trucks is concerning but not overly so.I’m also very biased so I just avoid the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 13:27:02'] Whatever you think of Tesla products, the stock looks absolutely awful right here.High multiple consumer discretionary stocks with huge exposure to raw material input prices are not what I would want to own going into an inflationary recession with rising rates.

Ford just announced they are no longer making profit on the Mach-E. Tesla can raise prices at 25% profit margin and still be sold out till god-knows-when.Sooo...yeah. They're doing fine. Particularly if you compare them to others in the space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:49:25'] If I had that kind of money I'd probably short but there is too many buying opportunities right now.Tsla's numbers are not going to be so good when they compete against cheaper alternatives in a world where people now have to pay way more interest on loans. When it will come between selling your house vs. buying/keeping a $70k+ car, the house will win. The future of Tesla may be bright on the technology side (energy storage and production, but I don't see a very big short to mid term upside for their car business in a world with more competition and higher rates. Especially if price goes up rather than down to account for better production capabilities and increased competition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 10:43:39'] I'm personally long. Tesla's PE ratio is like 95 right now which is almost ... reasonable? Their earnings went up so much and the stock price has come down a bit to a point where it's actually somewhat reasonable now if not downright cheap. Considering they have at least 3 years of 50% yoy growth AND higher margins coming, I'm thinking it's a pretty solid buy.

Back then I thought it would be stupid not to buy Tesla compared to any other car in this price range. Now I think it would be stupid to buy Tesla, cause there are so many good cars in 60K price range. So not sure if people will keep buying these at this price.

Also, the stock TSLA is 50% overvalued, all based on a Musk premium, that is faith in a CEO who "can do now wrong". Well turns out he does plenty wrong, increasingly, I would avoid TSLA until it hits 350.  Buy AAPl or BA or ford or anything else, all much better bargains.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 09:13:59'] > ...current bias on Tesla?           Elon has lost his marbles. His Twitter fiasco is absurd, and now he's endorsing Ron DeSantis for US President. Lmfao. I'm boycotting Tesla for the same reason I don't buy pillows from the My Pillow guy.         But, I'm also not touching that dumpster fire of a ticker. There's too much unpredictability and blatant manipulation attempts for my tastes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:15:30'] I've always liked them in a vacuum, but their share price has been so preposterous for about 5 years now that I wouldn't touch them with a 10,000 foot pole. Even now after cooling off a bit, they're still ridiculously overvalued. The profits they would have to make to justify even 420.69 a share, let alone their current valuation, would have to be exponentially higher than they are today.I guess that means I'm short then. The only reason I've never made bearish bets against them is because the hype has been able to fend off dips for a so long.

But I'd not buy any tesla now for an investment. Why?Well the PE is crazy.  Not as bad as it once was, but still too high for me.  It seems that over the past two years that fundamentals haven't mattered.  The whole meme stock thing.  But they matter to me, and will eventually matter for TSLA.  Hype can only carry a company so far. I think they are a good company and have done amazing things with cars, but they aren't the magic company some think.  The biggest problem I have though is the technology.  Electric cars aren't the future.  I don't see a major difference between a car burning gasoline and a car using electric made in a powerplant that is burning coal or oil or natural gas.  All electric cars use batteries.   Batteries have been around for 1000 years and they have always kinda sucked.  They get weaker and die eventually.  They are super toxic to make.  The future is Hydrogen Fuel Cells.  An electric car that has a power plant inside it.  Only produces water out the tail pipe.  Hydrogen is the most common element.  The only hard part is getting the hydrogen. It likes to connect to other things.  But eventually they will figure it out.  (On a side note I think the Feds should start a Manhattan project like endeavor to figure out hydrogen. We need it bad.)   As long as the US uses powerplants that burn fossil fuels electric cars are just a bit better than gasoline cars. I doubt we will ever transition to 100% nuclear.  We can't find a place to store the nuclear waste that we have. Its a giant problem.  People don't really want them in their neighborhood.Another problem is the capacity of our power grid.  Power companies have just enough power to supply our needs.  Ever hear of a rolling blackout during the summer?  Too many people running AC use too much power and the system is short.  If just 10% of people switched to driving electric cars I think the power grid would fail. If Tesla would start investing heavily into hydrogen fuel cells I would probably change my tune though.

This is a big gamble on Tesla part. They gamble on the fact that no one (include BYD) will be able to make EV as good as their and sell it as a fractional cost of a Tesla counter part.

The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Teslas stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabias sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-17 22:46:09'] If they had just held the stock, they would've made a fortune between 2018 to today. If they panic sold and/or shorted Tesla over a tweet, and missed the massive ralley, that's 100% their fault.These court filings are just copium.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 05:22:35'] Musk, hate or admire him, has been a master of generating buzz which has enormously helped his stock price and made him the richest or nearly richest man on earth.  His occasional tweets and statements have been to the benefit of himself--his stock price.  IF he lied about the Saudi wealth fund and committed fraud by stating he wanted to go private--then he benefited greatly from making those public statements--benefitted financially.  Hence, the lawsuit would be correct. The judgment is against him, but knowing the reality of the world, there may be shades of gray.  Musk  undoubtably intended to take Tesla private at the time, BUT as a CEO, he is not you and I making posts on reddit.  He is a man with lawyers, financial advisors, executives, and staff at his command:  he knows the law and has those to advise him on it.  He took a gamble to generate buzz to inflate his stock, but others lost money because of his deception.  There it is in nutshell:  his deception.   He may be financially liable if that is the case.

You would have to ask every single person and organisation if they had confirmed funding and get 100% of them saying "No".Or, Elon Musk could whip out an email, text, signed contract, or dated transcript that shows irrefutably that a person or organisation did indeed confirm funding.If neither side can prove the statement is false or prove the statement is true...how can this even be a court case? No evidence for or against? No case.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 08:20:26'] I don't care how bullish people are, 100 P/E is a ridiculous number and I would never buy a stock at a price like this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 03:30:33'] Smart Tesla holders are in this for the 2030-35 share price. Short term price movements do not change the long term outlook. The stock price in 8 years will be significantly higher than it is today, which means that now is a very good time to buy if you have the dry powder. In my opinion this really is the opportunity that people will look back on and regret, similar to wishing you bought some Bitcoin years ago. I have been reading every Tesla thread on stocks very carefully for two years and I am yet to see one convincing bear argument.

However I still believe in the company.Say what you want I am glad Tesla is valued at $1 trillion almost, all these other automotive did shit for years, didn't innovate, took money from oil rich countries and killed or not advanced/green electrical vehicle space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 17:45:34'] Tesla will print a new ATH above 1300 in 2022. That’s an approximately 22.5% gain from its current price. It may do much better than that. The only thing that could stop this is a macro event that causes the entire market to dip (or something very unlikely that’s not worth discussing like Elon having a health problem.)No amount of fundamentals trolling will stop this stock until EV stops being disruptive and the production hurdles are solved. Until then, TSLA will outperform the market. Only then will value/fundamental considerations take over as the dominant forces behind trading valuations. That’s where my money is at. I know of nothing with an attractive PE ratio trading at a discount to book value. Growth has outperformed value 19 years in the past 20. TSLA has worse fundamentals than most stocks but it won’t trade like a value stock until growth slows down a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 15:03:26'] Imagine if toyota and VW had adapted electric vehicle sooner………. This is what shorters of Tesla don’t get. Sony was the absolute king, it started the era of personal mobile audio devices with Walkman and discman, and that all went poof when they missed the age of digital mobile device, and now pales in comparison to the likes of Apple. Think blockbuster and Netflix……the absolute market share king of home entertainment went poof in such short amount of time. This is why Tesla warrants such high valuation. However the risk lies in execution, the risk is not overvaluing the potential, the risk is execution.……like yahoo vs google. Yahoo was absolutely the most dominant…but in series of mis steps it’s now barely a shade of its former self…..

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 14:54:34'] Many people still don't seem to grasp that GM, VW, Toyota and whoever else aren't making the same product as Tesla.It doesn't matter that they sell more CARS, they aren't making their money on EVs. Would you rather invest in a car factory or a horse carriage manufacturer in 1922?Tesla has a very large valuation, but as long as they consistently keep beating their own AND analysts very high expectations you  don't have a valid argument for criticism in that aspect. Very few companies grow 50%+ every year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 18:36:08'] Based on the ludicrous share price, this kind of beat is practically required at this point and still does not justify the current price, let alone any price increase.  Like 7 more of these monster beats are already priced in before you could even dream of justifying a higher price.  That being said I'm sure TSLA will rocket tomorrow... because nothing makes sense anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 10:21:33'] I’m laughing at “advances in FSD”. I finally got the beta…I haven’t been able to go 100 feet without saving it. First time I put it on…I live on a cul-de-sac, (a short 400’ long road with two bends) I won’t go over 15 mph down it…the car immediately accelerated past 25 where I took over. Exited that fiasco, went out on a larger street and put it back on again…accelerates to max (28) immediately then slams on the brakes because a pedestrian was nearing the upcoming intersection (walking not running, and nowhere near entering the roadway). Oh, aaand stopped beyond where it would have hit said pedestrian. Correct it. Start it again. I’m now less than one quarter of a mile from my home. Extra wide road (enough room for 4 lanes plus parking), two way traffic, 25 mph speed, no lines painted on center. Car immediately starts driving down the center and even center-left. Oncoming traffic and what does it do…? Attempts to steer further left. Yeah. I can’t even get me out of my neighborhood. This tech (as it is) is unusable, unless (And I’m speculating here) you’re driving on an unwalked, unused, completely straight, country road, with perfectly painted lines. I don’t think they could get this right if they had another 5 years. And I don’t think I’m going to wait another five before I ask for my money back.Love the car, but not being able to deliver on this is going to cost them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 17:53:31'] I've made a lot of money off Tesla but guys, Tesla had the market cornered on EV. But within the next couple of years we will see a host of electric options from other manufacturers including luxury cars like Mercedes and BMW. The market share might be maintained but at least in the US, in order to compete they are going to have to be more competitive with pricing. I like Tesla as a company but I don't see them taking the next step to 2 trillion market cap without increasing their solar production. Personally, I am not buying a Tesla car because the new interior aesthetic is off for me, no matter how many cool features it has. I'm waiting for a Mercedes or BMW options, both of which I have in ICE versions and the interiors are exceptional.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 02:08:07'] I think what people fail to understand the most is that the EV race, at this point is who can make a compelling 25k EV and not lose money making it. & guess which company will be the 1st to do it... you guessed it, Tesla. The "cheap" EV will unlock an enormous wave of demand (not that that's currently a problem for Tesla anyways). This is a HUGE reason why Tesla will continue to keep growing at a 50%+ rate for the foreseeable future. Obviously there are tons of other factors why they will keep growing like crazy (FSD, energy..) but I believe the 25k EV is a huge driver and why the stock will continue to grow over time. Just my opinion, relax bears.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 17:58:30'] Lol yeah, I'm sure it did. It's in Wall Street's interest for Tesla to not crash so underestimate the projected sales of tesla -> tesla surpasses it -> tesla stock rides or at the very least not crash. Those guys in Dall Street know to the last decimal how much any given company will make in revenue, sales, profit etc. unless there is a black swan event.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 18:31:29'] I sell semiconductors for a living.    Mostly into automotive.  The companies you mention are mostly for consumer electronics.  This market is slowing.  Automotive is continuing to thrive.  I am still having record sales monthly.  I see automotive semiconductors an attractive place to be in the future especially with EVs coming more online, they have more chip content then ICE vehicles.  Just my opinion.   The companies that I own are MCHP, NXPI, MPWR and ADI also ON is starting to look attractive, AVGO has a nice dividend. TSMC does build some of the products above but a lot of them have their own fabs which is a real advantage in bringing new chips to market.   I may be bias but this is what I see.

For example TXN, QCOM, AVGO I think are good. Nvidia? Yeah if I have to tell you why thats not a buy then maybe you need to reevaluate your positions and maybe just question if you belong in the market at all. TSM? Too much uncertainty with geopolitics. If you are fine with that risk then go for it. Its probably not a bad deal.INTC? The company is flunking on every part of its business so much so that its barely profitable yet they’re going to some how build these multi billion dollar factories across the country. Its a turn around play as well as a gamble. If you believe management can pull it off the same management that has lied and deceived investors in the past then go for it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 16:56:23'] At these levels? I own some Nvidia and AMD but I trimmed both yesterday and added Intel at around $29.50 a share. While Intel is easily the worst out of the 3, I believe they have way more upside from it's current position if they're able to turn things around, which I think is a higher chance than not. That being said, AMD likely has plenty of upside to go too. They've only just announced a partnership with Microsoft for investing in AI. Obviously they'll make a breakthrough sooner or later and have a nice pop. Plus it'll ride along with other AI stocks meanwhile. AMD is probably the safest choice here.Nvidia can go either way. I view it as a 50/50 gamble at this point so I'm not adding more.

Worst is WHR (Warehouse REIT). It was a growth stock for a while (they specialise in last mile warehouses), but the share price dropped off with Amazon’s own share price declining and then the rise in interest rates gave it another kick. Long term, I think it’ll recover and grow again - so long as the debt doesn’t eat too much into profits

Bought in on what turned out to be a high of like $6 a share, when predictions were saying it would likely triple that in a year. Covid stalled out the company's projects, it dropped to penny stocks barely hitting 10 cents a share by the end of it. They ended up doing some crazy reverse split to try and get themselves back over a dollar in share price and I got cashed out for everything I had for like $2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 08:23:12'] Worst: dumped about 9k into BSV at the very height of the crypto boom 2021. Had no knowledge of investing, trading, crypto, BTC, nothing - thought if you buy something that has increased a lot in price historically, just hold it until it's increased more before you sell, you're golden. I was deeply wrong and learned the hard way. I was also really into the idea of saving on taxes by holding for at least a year before selling anything. This led to my first mistake of not getting out of that horrible investment the 1 single time BSV experienced a peak high enough for me to have broken even.  Second mistake, became discouraged by BSV's pretty contstant trajectory downward from there (plus learning more and more about the total scam and lie that was BSV) and missed plenty of opportunities to average down and get out. After a couple of years, RH (my broker for that trade) delisted BSV and due to restrictions in my state, I had no option to transfer coins out off the platform so was forced to sell at a massive loss of about 90%. Learnings: a ton, but top learnings - DO THE RESEARCH. DD is non-negotioable. Read the charts for entries, don't just jump in. Understand the context before taking risk. Understand the risk itself - examine every possible scenario regarding the fundamentals of the asset & the contract you are entering with the trade. Understand the very real risks of delisting and what your backup plan will be. Understand the full scope of entry/exit plans before you put your capital on the line. Learned a lot from this deeply expensive lesson, and it hurt bad. Still does.Best: Have been keeping my sizable savings in t-bills and t-bill ETFs to take advantage of current high rates on short termers. Doesn't yield a whole lot but it's like a tax-advantaged savings account for me until I feel ready to jump into riskier assets. Feel great about this decision as it was extremely well-informed and I understand exactly what I'm doing with it. From worst to best, I see myself on a great trajectory towards future success.

Gained a little in divs, but lost around 10k if I remember correctly. Also lost the potential gains of that wasted money if I just bought something better.For total finance, Best was buying and holding ETFs for like 95% of my portfolio, then rebalancing quarterly and maxing my registered accounts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 01:56:44'] It will fall until it reached fair value. The market is shifting from meme stocks, based on massive growth projections, to valuation based on actual fundamentals.I did a DCF analysis on Tesla recently, and came up with fair values of:    (1) high price of $160, for those who are bullish on Tesla    (2) mid price of $56, for those who are neither bullish nor bearish and just seek "fair value"    (3) low price of $17, for those who are bearish on Tesla    Given that personally I am quite bullish on Tesla, I would be happy to start buying at the high price of $160, and at my mid price of $56 I would be buying by the bucketload. If it ever dips to the low price of $17, I will start to worry that something much have seriously changed about the fundamentals of the company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 12:45:19'] Nothing is confirmed at this point.  It's someone making an allegation.  I 100% don't condone any type of behavior like that, but let's see what evidence comes out....but if I was wearing my conspiracy theory hat for fun (which I dont normally do), the timing seems a little bizarre given that:1) This administration has been very obviously against Tesla/Elon the way it shunned Tesla publicly and tried to promote Mary Barra and GM as the leader in the EV space....clearly not even remotely true and kind of embarrassing to watch our president refuse for weeks to even mention Tesla by name.2) Anti-Tesla, Missy Cummings, was appointed to a key advisory role at the NHTS and is against tesla's autopilot technology.  This is a big area of future growth for Tesla.3) Elon decides wants to buy Twitter and open it up and said Trump should be allowed on the platform.  He also said he switched form Democrat to Republican.4) Elon's acquisition of Twitter relies on the value Tesla shares for his ability to raise enough capital ( I believe...correct me if I am wrong)5) S&P ESG dropped Tesla citing one of the reasons as “lack of a low-carbon strategy” which is essentially what the entirety of Tesla is about.&#x200B;This might sound crazy, but it seems like this administration has been very anti-Tesla and probably was freaking out about Twitter allowing Trump back on the platform and being controlled by Musk, so given the acquisition was linked to Musk's Tesla share value, if Tesla stock tanks, then Musk can't buy Twitter and it keeps remaining censored.Before my inbox blows up with unsolicited hatred.  I will say I own a Tesla and I love their vehicles and I and a few shares that I am holding, but nothing substantial.  I think Musk is a bit of a loose canon and is both an asset and a risk for Tesla even though he's a product visionary, I sometimes wish he would lay off twitter as often times it hurts more than it helps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 09:31:15'] It’s disgusting 🤮 behavior.   Please don’t minimalize or trivialize what he did.  Who wants to see his crappy pale —— anyway ?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 12:56:41'] TSLA is headed below $400.   No sense buying it at any price since the CEO seems to have lost his mind and gone off the deep end.   He is also a paranoid conspiracy theorist now and has gone to Brazil to hang out with one of the worst fascists and enemies of the environment on the planet, Bolsonaro.     Twitter deal?   I dont think Musk can even afford it now, and even if he does close it, most Twitter users will leave and it will turn into a rightwing Russian fake news thread.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 23:55:16'] People in the know have been aware of this since May. The Shanghai factory hasn't been fully reopened and was shut down for a month. When they were allowed to resume operations, it was only partially opened with scheduled shifts. June was the BEST production quarter ever... Q3 and Q4 will be an absolute domination of a quarter.BTW, if you think Tesla did bad, just wait until the other auto companies start reporting.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 17:37:46'] Who the heck knows, last quarter they crush earnings and the stock tanks.. so they miss this time and it will probably go up.

And those factory are only gonna continue to ramp
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 07:41:30'] I’d be surprised if they do under 450k in Q3. They’re fine. The headwinds of Q2 should be behind them barring another total Shanghai shutdown. And they’ll never again be as dependent on Shanghai as they were this quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 19:38:57'] In the short term it doesn't bother me. Shanghai suffered from covid shutdowns. It's actually quite impressive they came close to their estimate.However, this does raise the *long* term question of how crazy the CCP is going to be in the future. This shutdown is one data point in a long line of investor-unfriendly acts from the CCP.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 03:07:43'] I mean, it's a recession. Middle class people can't afford nice things anymore on their budgets. Give it a couple years and if inflation settles they will be able to again. The issue is, by the time people can afford nice things again, the other big automotive manufacturers will have these years to outperform Tesla's EVs and for a lot more affordable than a Tesla is. They'll lose market share drastically by the time this recession is over and will struggle to regain it.Have you been inside a Tesla model S vs a Porche Taycan? The Model S is barebones inside while the Taycan is like a freaking cockpit. Miles ahead of the Model S.Bearish on Tesla, Bullish on EVs by other big manufacturers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 18:14:17'] Tesla is priced based on future production and delivery capabilities. Guidance will be what moves the stock on ER.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 08:49:15'] The valuation assumes 40% YoY growth for the next 5+ years. Gonna be real hard to achieve that this year. And similar YoY growth is tough to accomplish the larger you get.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:20:49'] With so many traditional car companies churning out really good EVs but much better built qualities, the only most left around Tesla is the software. And the software hasn't really delivered full self drive and it is unclear when full self drive will actually deliver and how many drivers will want it. I really think Tesla is way overvalued thanks to the marketing genius that is Elon Musk. With that shine rubbing off recently (thanks to Elon's more and more outlandish shenanigans), it is hard to see how his image could continue to float the skyhigh valuation.

Berlin and Texas did about 12k in total. 133k from Fremont and the rest from Shanghai.Biggest reason numbers were still so strong is that Shanghai is up to a runrate of over 1M now, 1.2M after July's upgrades, and did 71k in June despite not being at full production yet.Shanghai will have some downtime again in Q3, but will be at a runrate and reach production in Q4 equal to their total production in Q1, which is just nuts. On top of that Berlin and Texas will start meaningful production in Q3. H2 is going to be nuts for Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 17:43:24'] I don’t like the idea of recalling it, this will put it behind legal tape for YEARS before it’s allowed, but I feel like their innovation has been as successful as it is because people are willing to test.The autopilot feature is freaking awesome, especially in traffic when you’re just crawling. I don’t typically use summon in a parking lot, but I have a few times for fun and it also did extremely well. I just got FSD yesterday and tested it around my block… it’s bad. It turns corners at a snails pace and I’d be honking at me if I was behind me. I’m sure it can do better in other cases.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 14:08:17'] Question. How isn’t FSD any different from Theranos’s blood testing machines? They are demanding money for something they know doesn’t work. Isn’t that fraud?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 17:11:36'] They're doing this because there have been 16 accidents in four years.  You know how many accidents there have been with people driving?  This is a politically motivated shot because Tesla is non-union.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 16:31:36'] It’s pretty funny to read the probe details.  In half the cases the accident was caused by other cars, the other half where Tesla drivers that weren’t paying attention(on their phone or asleep).   But they think Tesla FSD could do better by alerting those inattentive drivers sooner…yet orders of magnitudes more saves by FSD, seems NHTSA isn’t very good at maths.  Anyway I expect eye tracking to be turned on from this “probe-recall” which is probably for the best as annoying as it’ll be to use as an FSD owner, some people will always abuse FSD and blame Tesla.  We can never have nice things as they say.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 20:44:02'] Tesla is using machine learning to learn FSD and with every iteration and upgrade it gets that much better. ML requires shit ton of data and shit ton of iterations. To say it is dangerous during its BETA phase is to halt innovation and the ability to stop millions of deaths. No self driving car will ever be perfect, but if it can reduce deaths 90% then stfu and let them do their thing

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 18:46:43'] i dunno but their backlogs is too big to ignore, bought a model 3 beginning of the year got it 5 months later
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 01:14:21'] Just wanted to say, a lot of people suggest tesla is/has been overvalued for some time.Often the claim is made that it’s irrational Elon fanboys that are responsibleDoesn’t seem that’s true; seems to me retail isn’t responsible for tesla stock price over the last 2 years or so. Just don’t think they’re enough cash to keep the price elevated as much as it has been over time So, institutions obviously have fun a rationale and methodology to value tesla. No different than any other company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 16:45:06'] Definitely over $10 a share, and no more than $10000 a share I’d say.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 15:42:07'] 200 is not an insane number. I still think it'd be overvalued at that number, but well within a reasonably bullish interpretation.I do tend to have a bearish long term view of the company, though. I think they've past their first mover advantage and I just don't trust them to be able to manage actual competition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 17:19:31'] My issue is I don't like their cars...the other issue is .&#x200B;no way another company can compete with their scale without going BK.   Its like everyone saying walmart will crush amazon.  Well walmart would have had to destroy their business model and adopt amazon quick to kill them, but they missed it.&#x200B;Just like every other company missed it with Tesla.  Now how will they build these gigafactories??  Tesla has the run and every college grad wants to work there now vs google/aapl
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 09:11:04'] I bought at 350 sold 600 before split. I’m rebuying now started at 290 buying dips I personally don’t see it hitting 200 but will be buying if it does. Looking to hold long term regretted selling it helped my financial situation by selling several stocks I was way up on and finally getting out of cc debt.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 16:23:48'] Tesla is up 1,000% in the past three years.No cybertruck.No semi.No fsd.No roadster.I’d say sub $100 would make sense to me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 18:38:23'] FWIW August 2022, Morningstar thought it was slightly overvalued and estimated fair value at $255. it was trading at about $300 at the time. https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/tsla/quoteI'm no Tesla fanboi, but Morningstar is probably a more credible source than anyone on this sub.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 15:41:41'] I’d avoid it but I’m a hater. Competition is heating up and Musk is a huge risk. If you look at the response to AI Day the company is starting to become a bit of a joke to the average consumer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 02:18:29'] Tesla’s EV business peaked. That said, I will draw the comparison of it to Apple’s iPod business peaking in 2006 or so. Apple had an iPhone to usher in a new era in its life that made iPod sales look like peanuts. If Tesla’s gamble on FSD as well as robots pay off, it will have a humongous sales. Understood Tesla isn’t where Boston Dynamics is today but Tesla has money and the insane ambition of Musk behind it so I can only imagine the gap will be bridged no later than four to five years. Imagine having your own private slave robot at home doing all kinds of work for you (and at your business) that you show it once or twice to train and it does it on its own. Waiters in restaurants - gone. Hand washing cars - all humans gone. Dishwasher, picking vegetables, what would cost 40k to 60k per annum would be replaced by a 40k robot (Musk is notorious to understate prices so 40k is a conservative estimate). And even more beautiful thing is, bill of the cost of the robot will be software so scaling is easy and contribution from marginal sales is high.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 20:40:22'] TSLA being included in the SP500 makes the SP500 inflated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 17:25:12'] It is not a high tech stock anymore. I like to think it makes massive eVs.  Like Bezos, Musk will eventually  get tired out running a mature car company and move on.  If Ford trades at 11.20 with a book value of $11, why would I want to pay more for another car company more.  Does it make sense?FYI: Tsla book value is also $11.88.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 17:34:56'] I can’t say but the tech behind the ai for the robot is pretty cool. If their mechanical side catches up it could easily place workers in sorting facilities and such. Comparing it to Boston dynamics robot which requires predetermined input is not the same. If they were to use their mechanical tech and teslas AI it wouldn’t take long for an iRobot world
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 22:09:59'] Calling TSLA a car company gives stomach cramps.I mean GOOG valuation probably makes no sense then either? I mean it is just a search engine right?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 20:25:39'] $10k earnings per EV sold \* 10M EVs sold annually \* 50 P/E = $5T market capplus whatever solar and energy, FSD and bot add on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 21:27:54'] I personally feel it's overvalued for what it is. I feel like a lot of the money in TSLA is in hopes for what's down the pipeline. Only thing is, it has to all go well for them before competition catches up. The current administration obviously has something against the company, so part of me wants it to moon just for that reason.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 22:28:09'] hat bot was clown shoes.  They even stated they were afraid it would fall over which is why it did basically nothing.  This is where Tesla as a company struggles for me.  They overpromise, are one of the worst large companies I have ever seen at managing expectations at events, and marketing department sucks as well.  Elon is the marketing strategy and he insults his own products and teams 50% of the time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 00:30:23'] I’ve played with puts ever since It hit 1200 the first time. They consistently pay out. As do the calls but I think it goes down below 300 presplit price… so I’ll keep playing puts. Some don’t work out, most do. I just wait for a rally for no reason and get puts. 🤷‍♂️ it’s PE ratio is ridiculous but who cares. It’s just overvalued plain and simple. The market will correct itself soon enough and there’s a reason Elon has sold off a ton of shares so many times as well as done multiple offerings and splits to entice retail to keep the game going. So, My answer is.. I wouldn’t buy it until it hit $60 with updated prices, until then ima keep shorting via puts
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 05:18:37'] The problem with Tesla is the political power of the big 3.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 14:46:03'] Everyone is so focused on how Elon does things that make the stock price drop. But everyone ignores the things Elon has done, and will do, to make the stock price rip like it has in the last decade. Do you think he doesn’t have a plan?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 22:40:01'] First off Musk's erratic behaviour is a huge liability. Tesla and his other businesses since his PayPal days are more like pet projects than businesses to him. A Chinese company would have entered the mass production stage within the first 5 years and not mess around for 10 years. I wouldn't touch a growth stock with a ten foot pole where I can't come to a conclusion that the management is at least 110% competent long term. Second, once the EV market gets saturated with competition, it's all about building to cost when your margins are under pressure. Tesla's amateurish engineers have yet to demonstrate that they are competent with design compromises. They overbuilt the body while failing to design the suspension and rear drive units properly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 23:21:39'] $30 post split is appealing for me to look at their financials closer. It's tough to say of course, but they are definitely expensive. Too much hype by retail and fanboys
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 01:32:15'] I mean he said himself that Tesla is ‘worth basically zero’ if it cannot make its cars self-driving - and FSD will not be a reality for a very long time if ever (even if the technology would be there (which it isn't) regulations will deem it unethical). Highways maybe - but not FSD.

POST_TEXT: b"ig my question is p much self-explanatory. based on my (admittedly limited) understanding of what's gone down with twitter the value of tesla stocks are basically guaranteed to go down in the short term, as their current fall is going to necessitate musk putting down even more of his share and driving their value down further. in that case why don't investors just sell immediately and then buy their shares back once the situation cools down and twitter is either paid off or becomes insolvent? \n\nlike even if you do have faith in the company you stand to make a little money by selling now and then buying back once the value bottoms out, right? ig i don't see much point in holding on to your share at this point in time- esp if $tsla is just going to bounce back later.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 21:21:59'] No. I’m now just thinking about buying. I’ll nibble here and there on the way down. It’s always been crazy overvalued, but when it goes up, boy does it go up. You need to have some skin in the game ready for that moment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:14:42'] I’ve been holding $TSLA since 2020 and I just offloaded some of them for $NET. Imagine my surprise when Cloudflare beat earnings and still dipped 13% after hours. 🤣

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 04:27:42'] >in that case why don't investors just sell immediately and then buy their shares back once the situation cools down and twitter is either paid off or becomes insolvent?...because I'd be paying 27% taxes on my gains where I live. That would be quite a gamble to have it drop enough to make such a strategy reasonably profitable. Since Tesla is - to me - a long term investment (at the very least until their energy business plateaus which I don't expect to happen for about a decade) these short term variations don't really faze me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:18:06'] The fundamentals of the company haven’t changed despite Twitter. Still on track for major growth
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:18:56'] Did you consider that the best thing to happen to Tesla might just be musk spending the next six months worrying about Twitter and ignoring Tesla.  Musk strikes me as the kind of boss that never lets his management concentrate on getting shit done.Musk might be a visionary but Tesla needs to execute now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:30:22'] While TSLA is down just under 50% for the last year, it will in the long term recover and continue the upward climb.  Very few companies have performed like this rock star stock - 875.64% growth for the past 5 years.  Let that sink in,... nearly 900% growth... While there maybe some more fall out over Musk's new shiny squeaky toy, long them he is not going to let his cash cow fall down unlike Zuck over at Meta...  Finally, if you truly believe in the stock and what it is capable of in the long term, you never sell, you buy the dips for Cost Averaging.  Finally, you always avoid the knee jerk reaction to click the sell button.  Disclaimer - Held TSLA in the past.

You are better off investing in tires.  MGGDY is Michelin.  Their tires rate highly in almost all categories Consumer Reports studied.  Their dividend is \~3.6% .I laughed when Tesla became worth more than Johnson and Johnson back when it was over $1000 a share.  The posts were so arrogant supporting TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 10:42:43'] the ‘topping formation’ that you refer to is called a ‘head and shoulders’. it is based off the Tesla chart, specifically zoomed out to at least 5 year chart. it will look like 3 bumps. If you look, you will see the first ‘shoulder’ in January-February 2021, the ‘head’ as the double top from October 2021-April 2022 and the second ‘shoulder’ in July-August 2022. the head and shoulders can be highly predictive of a fall if the ‘neck line’ is broken, which is a line drawn through the bottoms of the bumps. actually, there was a head and shoulders on the S&P prior to this bear market. and many other stocks.

If that were to happen, you take it to the shop and they fix it, on traditional cars, or you call Tesla and they fix it - if you drive a Tesla. It's not like breaks are failing and people are crashing left and right. Or batteries are exploding.. So yeah, it will end green today ...

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-30 09:39:48'] Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.

POST_TEXT: b'https://cleantechnica.com/2022/08/05/tesla-operating-margin-1-in-industry/\n\nOne of the highlights of the annual Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin. Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now. The brand with the second highest operating margin, BMW, is a few percentage points below Teslas +15% operating margin. Third-placed Daimler, at 10%, isnt even close!\n\nGet down to Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and its a different world.\n\nRelated to money is energy use, and one more thing Elon Musk pointed out in the shareholder meeting was that energy use per vehicle produced has come down  cutting emissions while saving money. From Teslas factory in California to its factory in Shanghai, the company has achieved a 17% reduction in energy use per vehicle.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 19:52:29'] i dont know if it is a good sign.  bulls would say they are able to do it with state of the art manufacturing and verticle integration.  but another way of looking at it is they manage to keep their margin because they sell their car expensive.time will tell if when they ramp up sales if they can continue those kind of margin in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 15:00:01'] Well not surprised when your cars are built like a Kia and priced like a BMW
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 12:36:27'] With more competition, will they be able to keep the same pricing and quality? IMO, their margin is reflected in their products and it's not sustainable long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-06 02:19:37'] >Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin1. Tesla's cheapest model is at $46k now. Every other car company has much cheaper models. Those naturally compress margins.2. Tesla's is cutting back R&D by a huge amount. Look at the % of R&D to revenues compared to other car companies.3. Tesla only has 4 models. Other car companies have much more, to serve a bigger variety of customers and they also do yearly refreshes on those models, something Tesla does not do.4. Tesla Days of Payables is much higher than the rest of the industry. That means that they pay their suppliers much later -  thus increasing margins. That a company has much better operating margins than their competitors is usually a sign of worry. As competition is coming (and it is already there -  look at Tesla's sale numbers in Europe they hugely decline not just in market share, but also in total), those margins will compress. Additionally since Tesla has a higher market cap than most of their competitors combined, they need high margins and growth to justify it.I don't think they will be able to do it. Contrary to Software, new factories don't scale (to get from (500k-1m you need one new factory, to get from 1m-2 you need two etc), Tesla will not be able to deliver that growth and margins over the next decade.I actually think that Tesla will be similar to Cisco of the 2000. And I am making a guess: Tesla will not see 1222$ for the next two decades.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-06 01:43:54'] Explains the quality of their cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-06 13:18:08'] they deliver a tiny fraction of the cars of the large automakers so not surprising. Tesla sells less than 200,000 cars per year, while BMW sells over 2 million. The challenge for tesla is to keep 15% margins while 10x'ing the deliveries.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-06 12:43:12'] They're still burning money in multiple plants that because of rising competition may never reach full capacity.As other auto makers move to EV, they'll improve operating margins as well.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-06 10:17:24'] Almost as if there is an inverse correlation, where the more cars you sell the lower margins you can afford to have (and need to have in order to attract so many customers from other big manufacturers). I also wonder if maybe, just maybe, when you don't sell that many cars you have to have a large margin because you need to cover everything despite smaller sales.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 13:50:25'] The Q4 to Q1 in 2018-19-20 all had Q1 numbers come in less than the prior quarter. Tesla rly went above and beyond in Q1 2021 because they made more than Q4 2020, but in the long run this won't mean a lot for tesla and this is more typical of how Tesla has delivered vehicles in the past. Tesla also did abt 70k from Shanghai in December which was closed for 7 days this quarter. They might have been closed for longer but that's about all I could find, but going off their December run rate that means they should have produced probably about 14-15k more. So 320k should be close to the "true" production in Q1.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-03 00:26:47'] It’s entirely because of chip problems. Before 2022 you could order your Tesla the first 2 months of a quarter and get it delivered in the last month of it. So 3 months waiting max. At the moment you have waiting times of up to 6 months. So even if I ordered in January my car wouldn’t be shipped until 2 quarters later. Delivery Is starting to lag behind peoples actual interest in the car. On another note the car also got more expensive here in Europe. So the next quarter will probably look good because of all the orders before the price increase, the one after not so good. I don’t have any Tesla stock, I just like the car and considered buying one

As legacy automakers invest more in EV production, do you think TSLA will still be the EV industry leader by 2025?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 13:05:23'] Engineer here. Tesla's processes are fine that they're faster but they're also churning out sub-par product. I'm in all the Tesla subs because I like electric cars but the number of people that take delivery of a car with significant problems is way too high.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 19:55:08'] Hyundai is going to sweep the market. They’re already catching up rapidly. No one talks about it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 11:00:30'] We all hope some direct and massive competition against Tesla will kick in soon, so that I can buy a Tesla car at a reasonable price. Haha
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 09:55:12'] I can't imagine they won't be on top in 2025.  But to support their valuation, they probably need to have robotaxis flying to the moon by then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 12:48:51'] Looks like the weekly Tesla will be dethroned thread. The same people who are wrong about Tesla for the last 10 years are again making bold prediction of the upcoming challengers. The "competition is coming" crowd never gets old, no matter how many times they have been wrong in the past.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:56:10'] 100% on top by 2025. Might be more up in the air by 2030
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 09:56:48'] I love VW, my only issue with investment in Europe right now, currency devaluations against the dollar.  If I pull money out of the USA, it immediately depreciates as the euro is trending down.So my investment has to cover a currency devaluations and inflation.So as soon as the euro starts trending up, I plan on investing
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 14:37:09'] Tesla will lead this industry until at least 2028. The world is taking their time weening off gas powered vehicles and won’t make an easy switch. This will take a lot of time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:21:30'] Without a doubt, even the most aggressive EV plans out there dont even get started until 2025 by which time Tesla will have 2-3X the volume they have now.  It will take 5-10 years for anyone to catch Tesla, and if they hit on robotaxi/android tech they might not even be in the retail vehicle market by then anyway(just selling batteries, androids and running a robotaxi network).  And its more like 3X as fast as VW, and with 2X the auto margin profit... Diess is being nice, they are screwed.  I think the Chinese producers will fill the rest of the top 10, and many of the legacy autos will likely consolidate/downsize to compete.  Labor unions, dealerships and outdated management/manufacturing/engineering structures will change completely either way making the ones who survive hardly recognizable from the companies they are now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 14:17:29'] Tesla doesn't have any significant differentiating factors. "Full self driving"?😂https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-autopilot-false-advertising-santa-barbara-case/
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 11:50:45'] I dont think Tesla stands a chance when these other companies get more options on the road. Especially with the fact that Chevy just dropped the prices on the bolt to 25k. A lot of early adopters bought the Tesla because it was the only show in town. When there is massive competition  they will have a hard time keeping up. The main reason i believe is their price points. 45k for a super simple car, almost 70k for same car with upgrades. That brings major players into the game at that space. The BMW is a way nicer car than anything Tesla makes and can be had for 75 pretty loaded.  Porsche Taycan bottom of the line can be had for 90ish and is way nicer than a Model S. They will have to lower their prices to keep up IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 11:31:01'] Toyota hasnt even entered the race. Its gonna be massacre.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:31:07'] No because TSLA has competition selling cheaper.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 16:51:50'] A few comments. Everyone saying the TSLA PE is too high doesn’t understand growth rates and the margins on ASP for TSLA. Everyone front runs the numbers so it’s forward projections are more important and that make sense.Also people saying competition is coming doesn’t understand that in order for these existing legacies to scale, they have to retool their factories and really drive capex AND keep selling ICE vehicles to service the existing debt. What a shit show.Lastly, do yourselves a favor and watch the FSD beta videos on YouTube. That’s all you need to know about who Is leading SCALEABLE autonomous driving and able to offer it on a subscription basis for reoccurring revenue.Cool. 😎
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 21:22:22'] Volkswagen has a chance? Why they cancelled the Golf-e?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 21:47:16'] No, because Tesla doesnt have 1 thing the other major auto manufacturers has:  Dealer networks.I wont buy a Tsla because 1) it appears their quality and warranty practices are questionable, and 2) if I do have an issue, the nearest dealer is 2 hours+ drive away in a car that potentially wont run.If I buy a VW - its going to be well sorted chassis wise, have supply chain, and a large dealer network.  Their is a dealer in town, another 80 km away in 1 direction, and another 90 km away in another direction, and every city in Canada pretty much.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 22:34:26'] >do you think TSLA will still be the EV industry leader by 2025?**Maybe**, but they won't be forever, that's for sure. VW and Ford have been in the automotive industry far too long and both are devoting more resources into electric. Now that they are focusing more on EVs it's not a question of if they will dominate the market but when. I don't think 2025 is an unreasonable date to see somebody else take Tesla's spot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 23:08:43'] Why would I buy a Tesla and help finance Elon's insanity
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 07:06:18'] I think Tesla will continue to lead but that others will catch up in engineering but not the services/IT part of things of the Tesla package. Also a major thing is which company succeeds in securing access to input resources.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:05:47'] 2025?  Probably not - I’d expect one of the Japanese manufacturers to be #1 by then. Probably Toyota
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 19:03:45'] Race? I think you mean race for second place. Tesla is already over the finish line…

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 08:47:03'] I'm up about 1750% currently.  Last bought back in 2019 when it dipped under $200 (pre-split).  Sold around 20% around the time of the split.  No plans to sell the rest currently.My biggest concern with the company currently is whether they'll ever really figure out FSD the way they're going about it now.  They're not having any trouble selling cars right now, despite consistently increasing prices, and so I don't think the FSD is a big issue currently.  Autopilot is still pretty great.  But--barring some big advance with the AI stuff or other behind-the-scenes developments--it seems like figuring out FSD is the key to the next megaleap.  IMO, if they figure that out, I'll be able to retire.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 09:06:31'] In 2013 after a night out as a (broke) student I got chatting to my taxi driver on the way home who said he dabbled in stocks and I told him about Tesla and that if I were him and had money to invest it’d go straight into Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 08:09:12'] Oh I can just hear all the people on their way to comment on how Tesla is overvalued, a bubble that's gonna burst, how competition is coming any day now, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 09:00:58'] As long as Tesla continues on its current path it will justify these crazy valuations. But if the competition does catch up and growth slows or even reverses, everyone that has over invested in Tesla will be in for a rude awakening. I don’t think people appreciate how far down the floor is here. Personally I think Teslas best days are behind it but I certainly wouldn’t bet against it at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 08:30:24'] For all the haters please consider the following points:\- Tesla delivered 936k cars in 2021. Giga Berlin and Austin will both eventually produce more that than per year **each.** \- Elon said there could be up to 10 new factories over the next 10 years. \- Demand for S3XY is still higher than supply. If demand ever drops they can either lower prices or move in to other vehicle markets. This is the reason why Cybertruck production has been delayed. Because demand is so high for Model Y it does not make sense to move production away yet. \- The more the competition moves towards EVs then the bigger the overall pie will get. Demand for infrastructure, batteries and charging will also increase which in turn will increase demand for tesla products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 13:56:21'] I’m neither long nor short on Tesla. I believe by any reasonable measures it’s overpriced, but it’s not a reasonable stock. It can be it corrects at some point in the future and drops quite a bit. Or it could continue going up.Or both.I don’t know which I believe is more likely, and therefore I won’t touch it, too risky.

I want it to go up only after they achieve something great like a break through on fsd.tesla dont seem to have large market share.  I think only around 14 percent.  The globalizatiin of EV may be slower than most people think.  So its possible we may still only have 40 million EV sold per year by 2030.  If that is the case it is not far of to say tesla may only be selling 6 million cars in 2030.  But I think for tesla their battle ground is in the United States   If they can hold their US market share they should be able to sell 10 million plus by 2030.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 10:50:31'] I think in january 2024 we'll be looking at a 50-75 PE for tesla which with current growth will be between 900 and 1350 given current growth projections and past realized growth. So my current plan is to sell anytime it is above 1350 and buy anytime it is below 900. I update those targets after every earnings call and update my model with the new realized growth.In \~2030 I'm expecting we'll be looking at a 25-30 PE which even with almost unreasonably conservative growth rates (average 8% annually post 2022) will put us at a 1500 price which represents an annualized rate of return of 15% which is double the long term average of the stock market and a completely respectable rate of return.If Tesla can continue to grow at their current 2022 projected growth of 44% annualized rate then we'll be looking at 7500-8000 share price though I don't want to bet on that so I cut their growth down to the long term average of 8% for the stock market as a whole and even with that I like the current stock's purchase price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:23:42'] Stock market bubble != technology bubble. The same happened i 2000s dot.com bubble - stock market collapsed but it didnt make the Internet as technology obsolete. Quite the opposite - it thrived and to this day it is the backbone of the global economy and everyday life.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 21:18:20'] Outside of ChatGPT, AI hasn’t even started at scale yet. Sure, people are buying MSFT and NVDA, but both of those tickers are still below their high from 2021. I pay close attention to the machine learning community and can assure you no one serious is talking about time travel or anything that goes against the laws of physics. When it comes to AI tech and large language models, it’s the real deal and the development cycles are now measured in days and months. Also, this isn’t blockchain or the metaverse — AI is already powerful enough today, that as of 2 days ago, some scientists and people like Elon Musk are petitioning to slow down the pace of its development (I don’t agree we should, but shows how smart minds are taking AI very seriously). So, yes there will be an AI stock bubble at some point (probably later this year and next), but imo we haven’t seen anything yet. That said, because it’s so early, one caveat is it’s not yet clear where the value capture for AI will be — aside from companies with established competitive advantages (MSFT/OpenAI, NVDA) and maybe some semis (TSMC, ASML, AMD etc), it’s a bit premature to pile into AI growth stocks (eg, C3.ai)

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 04:04:32'] The current chat-gpt is only a Language tool.  So a bit overhyped.  Stock market like those short term catalyst such as Metaverse, infrastructure bill, covid vaccine, 3D printing.  Look at what price  those companies are now trading at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:38:09'] Software developer here. I was 100% skeptical on crypto....still am. I was a Facebook bear the second I heard about the metaverse. I think the metaverse is definitely hype.I think AI will be transformational. I just used it to solve a small annoying problem for me yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 22:46:33'] Bought a large portion of MSFT because they do not seem as overly inflated as nvidia and they stand to gain a fuck ton. MSFT is ruthless. Absolutely ruthless. Not only are they taking on Google but they will replace as many jobs as they possibly can to collect service fees. All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization. I can't seem to find any information on whether Microsoft is an investor of OpenAI but I hope they are. That way investing in Microsoft at least means exposure to OpenAI which is currently private.I also think OpenAI's chatGPT is going to become the invisible 5th member of any team. It is the duck. I think Microsoft and OpenAI have proven this is going to be big and it wouldn't surprise me if Microsofts stock doubles because of it. Many jobs are going to utilize this tech.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 19:45:11'] It doesn't have to be rational. Just look at the insane prices that ARKK stocks, tech stocks, marijuana stocks, WFH stocks, crypto etc hit before crashing back to Earth...or Tesla still.  AI will likely be a big thing unlike most of those

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 18:39:39'] The current situation is to AI is like Dotcom is to the internet, eventually it will be useful, but people pile into anything that mentions AI regardless of how it translates to cashflow.There's even a ticker for AI, it's up 200% YTD despite having deteriorating financials because people see AI = buy.At least NVDA makes money even if the earnings will never catch up to market cap.My guess is the next earnings cycle will kill this bubble or at least stop it from inflating farther until it shows it has the ability to actually make money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:28:45'] Personally think it absolutely is a bubble *at this stage*.Companies are jumping on the band wagon how they can leverage AI to do everything and anything and they’ll be a big hype run. It’ll come crashing back down at some point.That said, those tools will be useful in a variety of ways in the future.Think of it like the internet boom, sure they’ll be a lot of pets.com companies using AI that crash and burn. Ultimately it’ll find its place in the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 01:28:01'] Well there are moonshots.People have mentioned dotcom but if you look at AMZN's all time chart, it's 1376x.$1000 in 1997 turns into $1.37mil today.If someone invested in 100 different dotcom companies, $1000 each, and all of them failed except for AMZN, that's still 100k -> 1.37mil or over 10% p.a (and AMZN hasn't moved for 5 years)So if we assume AI is similar to dotcom, then hitting a big win AI company will hopefully lead to a huge payout.NVDA and MSFT are the least risky AI plays because even if AI is somehow unprofitable, they still have their existing profitable businesses.Also, why do people think MSFT and NVDA should be priced by only valuing only their existing business? While assigning $0 to AI.Lottery tickets cost money and call options cost money. The probability of additional profits in the future is worth something today.The lottery ticket is worth $0 only after it's been played.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 08:02:31'] AI is without a doubt going to be the most revolutionary advancement the world has ever seen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 02:41:16'] Nvidia is years away from making any significant money from AI yet the market prices Nvidia as if they could maintain a 35% growth rate for the next ten years whilst also keeping great margins. It's not impossible but it's extremely optimistic. Considering the current economic environment and Nvidias inventory stockpiling and the China Taiwan risk, whoever buys Nvidia at this current price is just extremely bad at math and risk management. The downside risk for the next year or months is much higher than the chances to the upside. Besides as with any new tech, the real winners in the long run will rarely be the ones who were there at the start.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 20:03:47'] I think it’s more than AI. Nvidia is also boosted by the price of crypto and FAANG seems to be a flight to safety position with the current bank/liquidity issues. Maybe throw in quarterly rebalancing as well. Personally I simply would not touch these at their multiples in a 5% risk free environment but I understand their “stance” in the current market. Reminds me of when Costco t￼raded at 42x earnings because it was the queen of inflation hedges. Notice too that investors will flat out ignore their earnings and guidance. I don’t see any holes in the armor yet. TLDR: I’m a big believer in sector rotation/positioning

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:17:50'] AI isn't just Chat GPT, although that one is in the news a lot lately. On the hardware side, Nvidia, Arista Networks, IBM, Intel, AMD (Xilinx), and probably more that I'm not aware of are all making AI hardware. On the software side, you have companies like Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and many others all integrating generative AI into their products. The AI market is expected to grow at a 37% compound annual growth rate from 3.3 billion in 2021 to 16 billion in 2026, according to Goldman Sachs. But most pure AI companies are currently privately held, which makes investing challenging. Honestly though, AI is a revolution in the same way that the Internet was a revolution. It will impact everyone's life. It would be smart to invest in it at an early stage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:24:08'] I’m super happy that the collective moved from shilling blockchain (an environmental disaster that in 10+ years hasn’t found a problem to it’s solution) to AI, which is making a profound impact on productivity immediately.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 12:25:24'] The "boom" in "AI" we are experiencing now is similar to the NFT and Crypto craze we had for the past few years. The same grifters who glomed onto those crazes are the same one pushing it now, even if its met with overwhelming negative responses. The AI investments banks on being the future of technology while ignoring all of its glaring problems, development time, and myriad of legal issues. ChatGPT is useful in certain cases, mostly mathematical or programming, but look at the amount of people trying to argue politics with it. The community around it barely understand it. They just now it's *something*. It's most defiantly a test of blind faith. I will not be surprise if it crashes and burns like crypto did, especially when the main push for AI right now is creating amalgamations of art based on databases of copyrighted work illegally collated without permission of the creators.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 05:01:50'] ChatGPT is the biggest technology breakthrough in the last 30 years. Once you look at the capabilities you realize the level of human intelligence it has.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 00:57:13'] The bubble could take years to pop. Technology is finicky like that. If you look back at the .com bubble - it’s major run up started in 1998, however it didn’t bottom out until 2001-2002. This is because everyone realized the internet would be the next big thing (like AI) but there are a lot of unknowns. Who will succeed, how profitable, etc. A company could come out tomorrow with a huge breakthrough in AI hardware or software, which I believe would cause many of the other companies to fall. Or there could be a few lackluster earnings reports, and many investors may lose patience and look to put their capital towards companies with better results, especially during a time of economic uncertainty. It’s difficult to price something that is almost completely unknown, so I suspect there will be wild price action for a while. You are best off DCA into Nasdaq if you believe in the future of AI as there is no way of knowing who will win/lose. Betting against the success of AI isn’t smart and it isn’t investing - it’s gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 04:11:49'] It seems overvalued, but there's a potential huge upside - at some point truly exponential growth may set in, and to have stakes at AI companies at that point would be very profitable.However, the longer this exponential growth is not visible, there's a risk of the bubble popping.Currently the models are OK for generic tasks, but not that great for more specialised ones. I'd be interested to see how good would a potential model be at learning new information from e.g. company-specific internal data source (documentation, etc.). Of course information like that is minuscule in comparison to the datasets LLMs are normally trained on, and so potentially it might still not do that great.Also there's an issue of accuracy - sure, the model may be impressive at times, but that doesn't account for much if you can't really trust it - there has to be a person fact-checking and overseeing the output anyway. It might speed up some processes, but people may be blindsided by how impressive it appears, vs how useful it actually is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 05:28:40'] These tools are going to be disruptive. They are not going to talk to us and form ideas, they are going to compute rational responses using a catalog of human thought and work. While this won’t be Skynet, at least not yet, it will require an entire population to learn how to use them. They appear to be poised to become useful in search, writing, publication, art and creative design, and probably a few unseen uses.If you work in those fields or with those fields you will probably feel the impact sooner than the general population, kinda like touch screens that were used in industry far before practical home uses. It is funny, schools will respond quickly. They will probably begin to use these tools and teach about these tools… and within 10 years anyone who hasn’t taught themselves these tools will find themselves at the beginning of a curve not unlike what we see today with “boomers” and they saw with people being unwilling to learn computers.

A lot of people think of AI as interactive robots, and although those exist, AI is common and useful in smaller spaces you wouldn't think of as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 07:30:31'] Its certainly hype but also keep in mind this hyped up moment is coming off a large valuation haircut. Its not the same as pointing to hype when the market was at the top two ish years ago. Along with this hype their business has grown as well in many other areas.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 09:41:06'] You clearly haven't used any of the current offerings. Bing can easily be more useful than Google now for information and news based searches. You can go to bing chat, type "was bailing out credit suisse good or bad" and Bing will compile a pretty damn unbiased, nuanced answer, and cite its sources so you can go double check. That alone has major implications for online search and if perfected, could help search bias become extinct while helping to accurately inform users on their platform. And this does not even begin to scratch the surface on use cases for these large language models like ChatGPT 4. I'd strongly suggest you attempt to do some real research instead of relying on articles from people who don't understand what they're talking about.

As for analyze Big Data it is full of bogus, non-crediable data I have a tough time to envision they are the right source.

POST_TEXT: b'>Hertz (HTZ) is turning up the wattage on its push to have a mostly electric rental car fleet.\n\n>The company said Monday it will purchase 65,000 electric vehicles from upstart Tesla rival Polestar. Mostly consisting of the sporty Polestar 2 sedan, the purchases will occur over five years. Availability is slated to begin in the spring in Europe and later this year in North America and Australia.\n\n>Todays partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint," Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said.\n\n>The Polestar deal comes hot on the heels of one inked late last year with Tesla; where it had ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3s.\n\n[Source]('

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-04 17:57:40'] Wait until first time EV drivers who drive these Polestar 2 to Tesla Superchargers and realize they don't work. Or when they go to Electrify America and half of the stalls don't work. Not bashing Polestar 2 as it is a very decent EV. But I wouldn't put too much faith for EV newbies not knowing how to charge their cars, even if Tesla end up opening up their Supercharger network.

Let’s see what happens tomorrow…Update: Hmm looks like people deleted their comments lol…anywho 223 PE ratio. No way in hell the Tesla’s margins are anywhere close to validating a 223 PE ratio.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 00:36:50'] Polestar is not really a Tesla competitor though. Tesla's easily selling every car they make and then some, and Polestar is doing nowhere near the volumes to change something about that. They're a legacy OEM EV competitor. Those are the EVs that are actually seeing lower sales because Polestar has a better car.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 17:15:42'] These purchases may actually cause major supply constraints on these vehicles and huge queues, causing OEMs to raise their prices, which would result in Hertz' units appreciating in value, allowing them to turn around and sell them used at a large markup.  They've essentially become a defacto Tesla / Polestar dealership / scalper.I believe it's Tesla's policy that the date you order the car on the site, you essentially lock in the price.  If Hertz ordered the Teslas last year before multiple price hikes, then they probably locked in some pretty low prices.  Maybe $6k-$8k cheaper than what they're going for new.Hell, Tesla just raised prices $3k last month in the US on most of their model 3s / Ys.  They also just raised the model 3 SR+ price by $10k (usd) in Germany last weekend.  And that's the one made in China with the LFP cells... in what world should that get a $10k price hike? lol.Fun times we live in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:19:03'] Fun fact. At the current price of Tesla, using a reverse DCF, it's assuming they will generate more revenue than Apple AND have 118% of the EV market share, based on the baseline EV production in 2030. How lovely. So, for those that think Tesla is a tech company, you're forecasting they will surpass Apple.Let that sink in. Can Tesla grow their earnings by 52% every year for the next 9 years?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 23:13:55'] You seem to spend a lot of your spare time on here talking about Tesla lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 02:11:58'] Oh look, its this post again
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 05:06:32'] Please also include profit margins in your stats next time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 06:10:11'] Why in the world would you compare EV sales to ICE sales. Bad analysis sorry
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 07:31:49'] Ah yes, let's compare the only company that's able to mass produce commercially viable EVs with a gross margin of 30% with a company that makes negative gross margin on selling ICE cars and depends on dealership maintenance and taking loans to finance to customer for their streams of revenue.That's a smart comparison.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 10:57:06'] Tired of these dumb ass posts. There's like 100 of them a day. Tesla is not comparable to other ev makers or auto makers. Other ev makers are years away from catching up to where Tesla is today production wise. There are many more aspects to Teslas business and other ev makers have nowhere near the margins Tesla does. There's just so much. Stop broadcasting that you don't know how to do DD with these posts.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 04:56:53'] I don't even hold a position in TSLA and I know this comparison is dumb. TSLA sells more than cars and is expected to sell more than cars. It's a risk asset with an expected growth into other markets and TAM that varies widely based on how they perform. Investors expect a large growth for years to come, especially in FSD software. It's RISK. VW is a car company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 23:25:57'] The stock market is all about stats. The human element is priceless and numbers people refuse to accept it.

You're comparing Tesla to the *VW Group*, not VW. the VW Group includes * Volkswagen* Porsche* Audi* Skoda* Seat* Lamborghini* Bentley* BuggatiAnd you're also including PHEV sales to get the EV sales to 539k. Without that the number is basically cut in halfYou're right, the stats do speak for themselves

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 11:15:33'] Look at profit percentage of income. You just said VW sells 11x the cars, shouldn’t they have 11x the profit? Also, VW CEO said that Tesla makes their EVs in 10 hours, but it takes VW 30 hours to make an EV. Tesla has lower costs of production because of how vertically integrated they are with EVs. Tesla is also growing 50% every year with plans to scale to 20M annual production by 2030. VW only does about 8-10M.If you’re gonna look at stats, look at the big picture.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 11:38:28'] You gonna post the same post everyday for the rest of your life?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 11:44:12'] There are some glaring flaws in your logic:1. You are looking at Volkswagen's total profits. That includes profits from Ice cars and service, which will only decline in the future.2. It's not well known how much profit margin VW has on their pure EVs. Based on VW CEO's comments in the recent past, probably not much. Tesla has the best profit margins on their EVs and is increasing sales at 50% CAGR, and generating massive operating leverage which will increase profit margins even more.Basically, the entire thesis is that every car on the road will be EV in the future, so the company that has the largest capacity to make EVs with high profit will have the highest market cap. Ice car industry is dying, so that part is more of a liability rather than asset.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 14:32:37'] OMFG, yet another one of these posts!

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 23:24:03'] ICE sales are not an asset, they are a liability - a stranded asset. Which is why all ICE-age car companies are priced so low. The expectation is that most of them will not survive the decade.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 00:06:24'] Tesla has the tech. But modern valuations are bizarre
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 01:45:30'] Because Tesla has Elon Musk and a cult following. Tesla is FAANG style automotive and VW is MSFT.  Tesla is trying to break new limits and innovate while VW has many car brands under its group and steady sale numbers, profits, and good margins, but Tesla has a sense of wonder because no one can really put an accurate evaluation on their technology that hasn’t been successfully applied to the market. Hell it could all be bullshit, but market sentiment is, that its building the foundation to being the leader in the growing EV space so people rather pay more money for potential growth than realized value. Value is great but is it real value and does it matter when no one else sees the value?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 03:24:49'] Because you know what’s better than profit? The promise of future profit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 05:27:08'] All I saw is huge profit margins for Tesla, the only thing they need to do is keep increasing production.  No one wants a VW over a Tesla.  So they just need to build more cars, which they are doing month over month.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 05:24:48'] I don’t think profit is highly valued anymore in a growing company. People want to see growing revenue where money is invested back into the company. Profit gets taxed. Profit is money not invested. Profit is expensive for a growing company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 08:29:36'] Ah yes the daily Post about Tesla being overvalued. Why don't you open some puts and show us the proof of your confidence.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 08:31:46'] But aren't stocks about investing in the ***future*** of the company? And not by their current stats but by their trending stats. VW has basically stayed in about the same ballpark of revenue for the past 5+ years, going up and down. While Tesla has drastically been increasing their revenue year over year since 2018. VW either increases or decreases their revenue by no more than about 10% year over year. Tesla just got their first full year of profit in 2020. But that's not what you should be focusing on. This is what you should be focusing on:Tesla2018: Increased profit by 50%.2019: Increased profit by 10%2020: Increased profit by 179% &nbsp;Now compare that to VW:2018: Increased profit by 7%2019: Increased profit by 1.5%2020: Decreased profit by 10%, making them lower than what they made back in 2017.Now which trend line looks better to you? There just doesn't seem to be any growth at VW in recent years, while Tesla is showing nothing but growth, especially in 2020. Not to mention the other companies intertwined with it, like SpaceX. While that's not necessarily reflective of Tesla's performance, it will impact their price because the both of them being under the same umbrella increases stability and assurance when either do well.Now, do I think Tesla is worth what it is currently worth? No. But I do think it is more valuable than VW simply because I see it lasting longer than VW, and even one day surpassing them. There are many reasons to value a stock what you value it at. You might go purely off of profit for that year. While others will value a company based on their trends. And others will invest based on meme culture. Which some might disagree with, but what is objectively true about meme culture is it keeps that name in your mind. It's free advertisement, and advertisements usually equal increased sales.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 08:34:11'] So you're saying Teslas profit margin is double it's competitors?  That's extremely impressive.

Now days, IP plays a big part in how people determine a companies net present value, however it is mostly speculation. I’m the case of Tesla, there is a potential opportunity for them to sell the insane amount of sensor data they have accumulated from their “self-driving” cars, if they deemed that as a better play over keeping the data for themselves.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 11:28:31'] Fun fact:  Tesla isn't just a car company.  This is like comparing Sony to Ubisoft.  Sony makes the platform and games plus a bunch if other products and services.  Ubisoft just makes games.Tesla makes the renewable electricity,  charging infrastructure,  utility scale battery storage, virtually makes its own batteries, and the vehicles.VW makes vehicles.Tesla is priced forward looking to the payoff of their lead in charging infrastructure, grid resiliency infrastructure, and oh yeah, a product pipeline (admittedly clogged) with an over subscription of backorders.The simple mindedness of the "dur cars sales" crowd is truly amazing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 13:05:10'] And Tesla sells more than just cars.  Their other business is about to outpace … if it hasn’t already … their car business.   I bought Tesla for the car.  I kept Tesla for their energy business.  Comparing Tesla to VW is not a true comparison.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 13:55:19'] I just lol when I see people still think Tesla is JUST an EV company and literally nothing more. Does the term vertical integration mean anything to you in regards to EV infrastructure? What about robo taxis and autonomous driving? Collecting swaths of road data everyday. What about their battery sector for residential households? Tesla is a combination of all these industries. If it were just a vehicle company I'm sure institutions wouldn't be buying at these levels, but they are. If you think retail is the reason why Tesla is currently valued at 1T I got a bridge to sell you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 14:38:13'] Tesla isn't just a car company. It's a battery, energy, solar, ai, technology company. So yes, it dominates simple car companies. And will continue to do so.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:25:47'] See here’s the problem with your analysis. You are comparing a car company, VW, to something that’s not just a car company. Tesla just isn’t in the car business, it’s in the insurance business, insuring their own vehicles with the AI effectively assigning rates based on driver data. They also have a fast growing energy business with the former SolarCity and are continuing to massively expand in their energy storage business. They are also breaking out into new AI tech. It’s this type of technology and spread of the business that makes Tesla much more appealing than just another car company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 02:30:19'] Have you seen a Tesla vs their Id4? One looks sleek and minimalistic the other looks like a kids' toy car with a bunch of whacky features. Until VW designs an EV that looks, performs, and price matches Tesla they aren't a threat. Same can be said about many other EVS; either they look nice and can't match the performance or they can match but are not priced for the larger market (Porsche, Mercedes) or have some sort of limitation (range or otherwise) that makes Teslas the better choice.You also forget Tesla literally has built a supercharging network in Europe and North America where you can literally drive to any major destination and charge like getting gas.I think some of you think removing the engine and putting in a battery makes any vehicle an EV and they'll sell just as well as an ICE. Early adopters want something they can feel good about that has an intangible personality associated with the brand. Tesla and Rivian. That's part of the cult following. Moreover, Rivian poached a bunch of ex-Tesla employees, is trying to brand differentiate from Tesla--Tesla is sleek and futuristic, Rivian is outdoorsy and eco/adventurish and is making their first vehicles fill the niches Tesla currently lacks: full SUV and truck.Legacy car makers are going to have a lot of difficulties reinventing their appeal to fit that mold. If they could have done it Tesla would not be in their current position. They've been the best-selling vehicle in multiple markets in the last two years, hands down, even when compared to ICE sales. Teslas are eating into the Germany 3s luxury segment as it's seen as an upscale vehicle due to their pricing. Do I think the stock is overvalued? Yes.Do I think they could possibly become the dominant global EV carmaker in the next 10-20 years? Yes.They'll have 4 gigafactories up by next year (Shanghai, CA, TX, Berlin) and Lucid JUST started to ramp up at their first factory. The innovation on their cars (whether you like it or not) has been setting the standard other manufacturers are trying to copy and meet. Tesla has had ten years of iteration going on for their cars and many other companies haven't even completed 2 model years successively, even those mostly based on previous models they've retrofitted. Audi is basing their etrons frames off ICE models and won't have a novel EV redesign until 2025. Additionally, their production line means there are constant improvements throughout the year. There is no "year model" because they are constantly tweaking the manufacturing process. A car is 2021 when it was produced in 2021 and there very well could be huge changes vs an end of year product.A teardown video between various Model 3s from the last few years showed at least five iterations on some parts in the hood. Legacy manufacturers simply cannot do that currently. They also reduced the welding from 150+ frame parts by simply casting the entire frame in a mold.I don't think many people understand the intricacies of what the company is doing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 02:03:47'] VW is nowhere near as cool as Tesla..
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 04:35:30'] Lol here we go again, can we just make a daily thread for people to voice how Tesla is or isn’t over priced?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 04:35:50'] Combustion engine + PHEV sales surely need to be discounted in any future vision (which is what the market is looking at). Governments are going to phase out new combustion engine cars; and whilst they will be around for a long time (e.g. in the second hand market, classic car market etc.) they will be legacy vehicles. The market looks forward. I don't think people want to be on a group that relies so heavily on combustion engine and PHEV sales - there is a lot of work for them to do between now and the future vision the market is already looking at.Anyway, I don't own any TSLA outside of some big funds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 05:41:50'] 1. VW group is playing a zero sum game - transitioning ICE drivetrains to EV, whereas Tesla is playing a positive sum game - gaining market share in the auto market by ramping up EVs as fast as possible. VW will not outsell Tesla on EVs anytime soon.2. Tesla is the most profitable auto manufacturer in Q3 with a 14.6% operating margin and a 11.8% net margin. This is before taking into account a good chunk of the latest price increases, and the operating leverage is still growing as costs ramp slowly and volumes ramp quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 07:31:24'] Short it then!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 09:47:45'] You can’t torment Tesla shareholders with your silly statistics, we’ve made a lot more money than you have

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 00:09:20'] Oh it's *that post* again, yep definitely no one though about it before, I kept hearing this since years ago yet the market kept disagreeing with you, if you think its only a matter of market cap just short it
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 01:14:26'] Then why is VW and Ford scared of Tesla if they are doing so well.  Just keep continuing with the same half assed effort and see how long they'll be around.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 02:21:55'] So how much did you make with VW in the last couple of years? Money speak a lot more than stats.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 23:19:56'] Yes, I was thinking like that years ago, and the stats didn't improve much as noted... so missed the whole Tesla stock ride. Oh well. It's a very strong story stock - although they have recurring cash flows with monthly subscription.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 00:21:01'] Pierre Ferragu made a really interesting comment on this yesterday: Given how Tesla is in a complete league of their own and totally disrupting this industry, it should be worth multiple times the other automakers combined.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 02:40:24'] Tesla is the Apple fanboys version of a car/company, only that Apple doesn't create hype from non-existent products. If Apple designs a car Tesla fanboys will be like having to choose between their wife and their daughter.Everyone knows that Musk is full of shit and lies all the time. Tesla car will never drive itself just using those 0.3 mpx cameras as sensors, not even a side camera, unlike competition which use more sensors and mapped roads and still have issues. Their battery technology is non-existent as well. Even Chinese can now compete with their Apple-style crap quality cars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 23:57:33'] Do you account the revenue that the publicity around Elon generates? Thats billions of dollars in ad revenue etc. Of course none of that goes to the cashiers of Tesla, so the stock market makes sure they are compensated

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 14:54:10'] Why are people still pushing this narrative. We’ve heard it before, and we can confirm it isn’t retail investors moving the stock hundreds of billions in market cap. Tesla is not just a car company. Say it with me TESLA IS NOT JUST A CAR COMPANY.It’s like saying Microsoft is just MS Suite while disregarding the other streams of its business. Additionally when people are doing DD they tend to look at management. People aren’t necessarily investing in Tesla but also Elon. I hold no position in Tesla besides my SPY exposure but damn this is so annoying to read a million times a week.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 17:54:25'] VW has held two holy-shit-tesla-is-going-to-kill-us meetings in the last 18 months, one in the last month. In the most recent one, CEO Herbert Diess noted it takes Tesla 10 hours to build a Model 3 and it takes them 30 hours to build their comparable EV. VW is aiming to decrease that to 20 hours by 2025.So… VW isn’t even trying to catch up to Tesla because it can’t. Tesla is continuing to innovate at a pace a company like VW is not capable of doing. Most legacy automakers are dead-men walking.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 05:30:23'] You are comparing LED technology vs CRT technology. Yes, at one point CRTs were sold at a higher rate than LEDs. We're at the inflection point where consumers are slowly ditching CRTs. The only difference is the rate of adoption and cost of adoption.To the fucking moon!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 06:00:21'] No one is getting tormented by this. Long gone are the days where a company’s valuation means anything. TESLA, GME, various cryptos, Nikola, whatever. None of their valuations make sense but the reality is that the market has proven this to be how things work. If you keep raising your nose at these opportunities because you’re a sensible investor then you’re just letting money go. Not that it’s always gonna work out, many of these are borderline scams that are gonna get rug pulled

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 08:45:59'] Some people are still missing the point, VW only sells cars, Tesla isn't just a car company and is expected to sell more than cars.VW is also in massive debt, over $200b IIRC.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:51:49'] I’ve been tracking ATZ.TO for a while now. My only concern is recession taking a hit on their sales as the average item they sell in price is comparable to LULU (maybe even more if you include their outerwear). Still the brand seems to be wildly popular so if it dips then it’s def a buy. Same thing with Sonos (not the ticker you mentioned) but IMO had an equally sticky customer base who rave about the product and experience. Again not sure if I want to own a higher end brand in a recession especially if FEDs want to increase unemployment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:48:51'] Good luck. I love how the vast majority of these posts don’t even begin to pay lip service to any sort of valuation model.

POST_TEXT: b'\nI have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:\n\n* Nvidia\'s advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.\n\n* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.\n\n* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.\n\nWould love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that\'s great as well.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:03:30'] Just buy AVUV in addition to whatever you currently hold if you want to overweight smaller companies. The equal weight ETFs have higher expenses, you'd be better off holding a traditional S&P500 ETF + a targeted small cap fund.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:11:30'] I'd say pick a lane.If you want to be an active investor, do the work. Buy individual companies with strong franchise when they're bargain priced (read: unpopular for no good reason).If you don't want to do the work, buy a broad index, accept the 6-7% returns and focus on work you enjoy.Fiddling around in the market is a wonderful way to get mediocre long term returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:28:00'] I'm definitely geared towards small caps actually. Anything other than big cap tech really. I think recession risk is baked in and that it's not going to be that bad actually so small caps/industrials/financials will do well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:46:07'] > Nvidia's advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaperDo you have a source for this? IMO if hardware for machine learning gets cheaper all that will happen is big companies will buy more of it and use it to train models with more parameters, or train more models at once for hyperparameter selection. I don't see how it would narrow the divide, unless the big models hit diminishing returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 20:12:42'] I am a strong advocate on holding "RSP" type of stocks.  In 2022 if you owned eqw SP500 like rsp you lose -8% less than S&P500 holder.  For a long haul the return is about 12% higher than more volatile S&P on annualized basis. After discussed with several old timer money managers, I like DIA also,  Both RSP and DIA went up 2.15-2.27% today while SPY was up less +1.4%.  Its heavy weight fanng did not move up a lot.  Same with reinvestment etc.I may caution you QQQ is not meant for everyone. My Nov 2021 I added it for comparison and I regret to admit timing was all wrong. Still baghold that index.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 11:54:13'] The comments on this “stock” sub are the apotheosis of stupidity. First, Elon isn’t saying California sucks and always did. He’s simply saying that achieving the level of success he achieved is becoming more and more difficult due to policy changes. Which explains why he and his company are leaving. California has plenty to offer, to many folks, but he is now a target—and he’s not wrong. It’s becoming harder and harder to succeed in this country in general because of policy changes in Washington that crush main Street. Second, wealthy folks don’t mind paying taxes. The problem is, the money is wasted. The government doesn’t have an income problem, it has a spending problem. So when I lose half my paycheck or earnings to taxes, yea, it kinda pisses me off. My family came here with nothing and I was taught that taxes are the entry fee we pay to be Americans. I’m okay with that. But When I see how the government now spends my money, it boils my blood. So, without going into too much detail, I’ll say that the narrative among many in the upper tax bracket is not a general opposition to taxes, but rather how that money is spent foolishly and it is therefor frustrating to see hard earned dollars pissed away. Elon’s billions will be gone in 8 months. In 8 months uncle Sam will have spent every penny and there will be nothing to show for it. Third, I don’t care how much money you start with, achieving Elon’s level of success is near impossible. I’m sorry to say this, but anyone that bashes his success or where he started, is extremely ignorant, clearly bitter, very likely unsuccessful and will remain so, and possess both a low IQ and EQ. Elon has single handed my advanced mankind though Tesla, Neuralink, SpaceX, starlink, the boring company, he is currently working quietly on carbon capture . . . The man is brilliant and driven beyond comprehension. I don’t care how many great people you claim he hires, I don’t care how much money you think he started with, no one accomplished what he has by sitting back and watching. His level of success and innovation is absofuckinglutely insane. To say otherwise (and I rarely use this word) is the very definition of stupid. Fourth, this is a stock sub. While you have a right to espouse your beliefs and ideas wherever you damn well please, perhaps you ought to consider talking about your socialist ideology elsewhere. Or whatever communist, socialist, illogical fantasies you possess. This isn’t the sub for it. Fifth, when did we villainize success? Growing up, I was told to admire, learn from, watch wealthy successful people. And I did. And it helped me achieve my success early in life. I looked to those people for inspiration, guidance, advice and help. I never villainized them. I respected them and their hustle and what it took for them to get to that point in their lives. Now we make these folks out to be monsters. Truth is, they are just normal people who are willing to work a bit harder, with a bit more focus on specific goals, they are excellent at execution (where most fail) . . . They got to where they are by being smart and working hard. Perhaps, instead of villainizing them, we should aspire to achieve that level of success ourselves. And then, guess what, you can use your platform to espouse whatever crazy ideas you have. You can give all your money to charity. You can do anything you want.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 14:15:49'] EV's are getting hit across the board. Unless Tesla had insane margins for Q4, most investors knew what to expect already once Tesla reported their Q4 deliveries.I just want to highlight the value investors who still can't get over Tesla's P/E ratio which at this time, is hovering around 190. Note: No other EV maker is even profitable right now selling purely EV's so while people are bickering about Tesla's high P/E ratio, do realize other EV makers are LOSING money selling EV's.Tesla just reported $5.5 billion in net income for the year 2021.For reference, GM reported, last year, net income of $6.43 billion.Keep in mind, this is despite the fact that GM does 3x the revenue of Tesla.All this should tell you is that Tesla's margins are INSANE for the auto industry. Combine this with the fact that GM and other car manufacturers are losing money selling EV's, expect their net income to drop while Tesla's net income climbs exponentionally. Just two years ago, Tesla was bleeding billions of dollars. By the end of this year, their net income is likely to reach $7-8 billion. That's bonkers for a company that just 5 years ago, was on the verge of bankruptcy. That, my friends, is why Tesla's stock climbed to astronomical numbers during this stretch.I don't really care for the afterhours activity or even short-term market reaction to this earnings. I am more interested in Elon's earnings call appearance today. It will be interesting to see the guidance heading forward.And if you're still one of those people shouting that Tesla is overvalued, just realize that the noise is getting quieter and quieter every year that passes. And that's for a reason.

POST_TEXT: b'Source: https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-5e6c354622582f9d4607cc5554847558\n\nDETROIT (AP)  The government will soon release data on collisions involving vehicles with autonomous or partially automated driving systems that will likely single out Tesla for a disproportionately high number of such crashes.\n\nIn coming days, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans to issue figures it has been gathering for nearly a year. The agency said in a separate report last week that it had documented more than 200 crashes involving Teslas that were using Autopilot, Full Self-Driving, Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or some other of the companys partially automated systems.\n\nTeslas figure and its crash rate per 1,000 vehicles was substantially higher than the corresponding numbers for other automakers that provided such data to The Associated Press ahead of NHTSAs release. The number of Tesla collisions was revealed as part of a NHTSA investigation of Teslas on Autopilot'
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 11:40:22'] Tesla collects and provides actual data. The others simply report crashes they're made aware of, and are not proactively looking for crash data to share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 20:42:56'] I'm not trying to protect them, but I think there are too many doubts and issues on the data itself to conclude that "Data likely shows Teslas on Autopilot crash more than rivals"  \- What if Tesla cars were driven more often and covered longer distance? This can make per 1,000 vehicles number unfair.\- Differences on reporting the crash by automakers
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 11:48:19'] How much of that is user error, when fully autonomous doesn't exist but the driver thinks it does?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 13:43:16'] I’ll be interested to see the full report. I drive a car with traffic aware cruise control (or whatever) and it feels like a much safer way to drive. Especially over long distances and on the highway.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 17:23:30'] In other news,  reported data is more data than unreported data.  Also, the sun is hot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 18:40:33'] Accident per 1000 car is meaningless, especially when GM or Toyota doesn't even know their car was involved in a crash. Most Tesla has over 300 mile range while Mini Electric is not even 150 miles. Guess which car is driven more often. A more sensible and convincing metric is accidents per a million miles.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 23:45:08'] That’s because other systems are extremely limited to low speed and a selected few areas, whereas Tesla autopilot are available anywhere and people literally have sex while using it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 18:05:13'] I would blame the Tesla drivers. Tesla’s auto-pilot system is overhyped and underwhelming. Drivers tend to be less vigilant when using auto-pilot because they have been mislead by this hype. Tesla itself doesn’t encourage this behavior
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 15:12:18'] Lack of radar, cameras only is very flawed
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 16:50:24'] It’s good that they’re looking into this but I suspect they will not account for many other factors, ie Tesla having much better reporting and factoring in how much (miles driven) the driver assist systems are used. A system that is used frequently is going to crash more but that has to be viewed in context with how many times it helps too.Autopilot certainly has issues but I trust even less the dirty tricks that are being played by the legacy automakers, dealers and elected officials right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 19:41:14'] Apples and oranges. Others don't have data.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 17:29:17'] So the company that has tens of thousands of beta testers on the roads driving their regular routes has more incidents than companies who do this at reduced scale with paid drivers. Simply surprising. 😵
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 12:56:14'] this is dumb, the driver crashed because they are still solely responsible for monitoring and ensuring safe operation of their vehicle.why are you booing me I'm right
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 14:25:16'] Even a modern airliners AP malfunctions (more often then we think). When the computer behaves in a way it shouldn't be the pilots take manual control. With the Teslas the driver still needs to monitor and then intervene when necessary.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 11:33:07'] No surprises there. Tesla exaggerates the capabilities of their cruise control to sell more cars and upgrades. Drivers that are fooled about it tend to be at more risk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 17:11:54'] When people see a Tesla they pull out more often in smaller gaps. Auto pilot will save me. Truth. Until all humans are without control we will have heaps of problems

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 22:30:00'] agreed with Elon - the US should stop immediately purchasing oil and natural gas from Russia! Put in Russia
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 08:26:39'] This is also the GOP talking point at the moment in Murdoch outlets.I don't diagree with it, but people will be really upset (some) when they see $7/gal gas here in the States. Which will then be blamed on the president...and that is another liability of his that will be drummed up.However Russia needs to have all the economic stops taken to ensure this kind of cancer doesn't spread and does not become the new normal."Hey, nice country-not-a-country you have there. Would be a shame if it just remained free. Also....NUKES!!!!! Don't touch me or I'll use them!"
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 06:32:29'] Even if we did increase our US oil and gas drilling/production (as Elon is suggesting), wouldn't there be a really long ramp-up time?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 01:45:01'] ITT: People grasping at straws trying to find some ulterior motive.Elon's never invested in anything other than his own companies and crypto, he's not suddenly invested in some random oil company.His rockets run on liquid methane which is derived from LNG and requires only a miniscule fraction of the LNG the US uses in total. Elon's also never said he's against fossil fuels, just that he's against using it on the scale we do, like using it for energy generation or transport.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 16:08:03'] Oil gang, where y’all at?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 09:35:04'] We have a President that thinks that as long as we buy oil from other countries it doesn’t affect the environment
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 05:52:10'] This is an odd take here. I’m surprised “stocks” is taking this wee bit of bait.  Like high oil for half a year doesn’t really matter at all for Tesla in the larger picture. It’s moot honestly.  He knows that, we know he knows that and printed this fluff anyway. If anything this drives up demand for electric vehicles more. Bullish on Tesla bearish on oil, long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 22:13:29'] His rockets don't run on batteries
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 14:47:08'] OPEC is a glorified cartel literally deciding how much oil to produce and this current oil price crisis could be solved immediately if they decide to increase production.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 02:49:22'] Wouldn’t this be a great opportunity to invest in renewables?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 02:06:05'] Jesus, the people in this thread are dumb as fuck. The entire reason Putin is able to invade Europe like Hitler is that he thinks there's no alternative to Russian gas, and Biden screwed us by putting the kibosh on fracking. If we could ramp up natural gas production and LNG shipments to Europe, then we could all tell Vladimir to piss off. As  always, Elon is light years ahead of the rest of you morons and the Russian government is terrified of him.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 07:30:01'] "despite negative effect on Tesla" quit sucking the man's dick. Oil effects the entire economy and if things are more expensive generally that means there's less disposable income for people to spend on things like Teslas which hurts Elon's bottom line. A recession does not help Tesla, no need to make him a martyr lmao

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 00:49:17'] What negative effect? Ppl dont buy teslas because they cant afford gas. Lol Tesla is for rich ppl
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 05:27:22'] All Musk is confirming is that the green movement is willing to throw the baby out with the bath water.Even at the cost of being gigantic fucking hypocrites and paying money to despots in China and Russia.  They would buy North Korean oil if it existed because as long as it isn't here it's ok.China dumps toxic waste into the Pacific to make your dog's squeaky toy but it's ok.  It's not here.  And here can be Europe, Canada, Australia, or the U.S.  pick one.There is no negotiation on this.  The course is set.  And of course, nuclear is off the table because reasons.  I never thought I would live to see France at least being somewhat pro-human by building more nuclear plants and addressing the real issue: wind and solar aren't reliable enough to do anything but augment reliable sources.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 22:59:27'] Why negative? Is tesla no longer able to sell their carbon credits? Or is this something that has expired?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 03:52:18'] Because his rockets are running on gas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 23:26:14'] Why should they? They are running a business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 08:47:39'] Lol at that last line in the title. “Despite negative effect on Tesla” am I the only one that forgot Tesla is more or less an energy storage company. High energy prices no matter what form that energy is in, isn’t in Musks interests which mean lowering those prices with our own reserves is in his interests.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 09:35:27'] Ok, Elon thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 12:29:09'] Put your money where your mouth is and loan these companies the massive amounts of capital that they need to expand then, Elon
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 12:34:26'] No shit, Sherlock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 13:29:41'] It's not funny that people are actually serious about what that a$$ says.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 13:38:11'] How is high gas prices negative for Tesla?! Thats gonna be the booming of electric vehicles, no?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 14:26:22'] Does the US buying foreign oil/gas really have a negative effect on Tesla? Wouldn't it have zero effect?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 15:13:41'] Elon pulling a Frank Reynolds over here cause he's prob heavily invested in gas stocks as well. "So anyways, I start blasting..."

He’s now does  nothing but troll on twitter… manipulate market… No one care if leaves earth one day..
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 20:41:47'] Papa musk makes more money offs a good economy he doesn’t want ridiculous gas prices to fuck it up
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 20:54:41'] No one bailed out the producers when the price went negative. Do not expect them to bail you out when its $140.There is no state owned oil company in the United States, and price fixing is illegal. That was made quite clear in the Spring of 2020.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-06 02:29:05'] This should be obvious what Musk called for.Oil prices are going through the roof, if the US wants to hit the Russian state budget its very reasonable to just plan on pumping more oil to decrease the price of it.The US might probably try to reach an agreement with OPEC countries about it too, but we'll see will that work.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-06 06:29:06'] It doesn't affect Tesla negatively. Increased oil production affects his competition negatively. Incentives for EV and renewables also mainly rewards his competition. He's already in a position of clear advantage and is doing everything he can to stay there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-06 07:03:08'] Elon Musk is being realistic because cheap energy is fundamental to general micro and macro economic well-being
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 01:13:31'] [removed]
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 02:39:24'] POTUS is really making great moves out there. First communication for Ukraine and now finding ways to kill Russia’s leverage without enabling a war
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 01:15:06'] Of course he is looking at profits. If oil goes higher, materials that are harder to mine and are abundant in Teslas (copper, nickel, cobalt, lithium) -  will get much more expensive. He does not do this for the good of his heart, but because if oil goes up a lot, EVs get more expensive than normal cars (they have fewer materials that are that hard to mine).
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 00:32:48'] I really doubt he’s commenting as a humanitarian or on the side of the Everyman. If oil prices continue to surge, it will cause a massive recession and could break his bubble stock. I think his messaging is risk mitigation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 01:42:08'] So he sold stock in his own company and invested the proceeds in oil companies. Go figure
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 03:07:38'] short tesla got it elon!

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 12:15:56'] Let's stop posting about Elon, regardless of what he says. He's like a sports game streaker, who's only doing it for attention.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 05:04:09'] For some reason, the Russia/Ukraine conflict is jacking up prices of electricity in parts of US, so maybe beneficial for Tesla?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 09:59:19'] We need to be building Nuclear Plants. Most reliable most safe energy still. We can keep advancing the solar panels because the muslim slave population isnt the greatest at building efficent panels. China is a problem  and needs to be dealt with. Let Europe deal with Putin as he only cares about the great reset and all the bullshit they think they can do. America needs to focus on its own internal problems we are about to fall apart and if we die freedom dies everywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 10:47:19'] The amount of people on this sub who dislike Elon and turn irrational every time he is mentioned is mind-boggling. Elon is 100% right here. Russia's energy is around 50% of their exports. It brings in about $1 billion of profit for Russia every day. Their economy is effectively crippled if even 20% of their ability to export this energy is removed. Seriously, oil prices will be insane in the summer. Gasoline prices in California will easily hit $6-7 per gallon. This will mean businesses will all have to increase prices... your food in the supermarket will increase prices. How anyone can afford to pay for $6-7 per gallon is ridiculous. U.S. needs to start pumping as much as they can until the economy is resettled.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 11:06:29'] Even if Russia only supply 3% gas to US. You can’t just find those extra 3% replacement out of thin air.Not to mention EU who depend on almost 50% gas from Russia.The fallout from sudden drop of total gas output will devastating working class people since price will go up sustainably for all essential commodities like food, grocery etc.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 02:46:54'] There is vaporware and there is also the only car manufacturer in the world that owns the biggest and best charging network of the world,  who also has Solar and Battery facilities as a side-hussle. They have the highest margin in their industry WHILE they innovate on AI and self driving. Would you want to own this manufacturer for the long run?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 05:26:44'] >Anyone here actually holding Tesla long term even with all the bad newsYes. The decision is pretty easy.\- Tesla has loads of pricing power due to very high profit margins\- They go from record to record each quarter\-  They're (virtually) debt free (unlike all competitors which are mostly 100bn+ in debt).\- Vertical integration. The amount of flexibility and first mover potential/advantage that comes with this seems to fly under the radar of most.\-  They have the pick of the best and brightest when it comes to hiring (this is probably the major reason why Tesla is going to be successful in the long term. Product 'now' is one thing. But long term it's about people.)\- They have other parts of the company set to bloom (energy being the prime candidate that is set to take off now that the battery supply block seems to be getting resolved. But stuff like the semi with FSD could be a game changer in the trucking business - even if it's relegated to highways, only. I'm not even counting the possibilities of robotaxi or Tesla bot)\- They have THE global charging network. Opening that up is an instant cash cow of significant size\- strictly from the stocks side:  Large institutional investors haven't even started adding Tesla to their portfolios due to it only being ranked "investment grade" a short time ago..... and, most of all: Tesla has a customer base that is happy with the product to a degree that any other manufacturer could only dream of.(I probably could come up with some more reasons but that's just the ones that spring to mind. Personally I also count Elon as a big plus since he's got a very clear vision on what needs to be done, but I can see where others would disagree on this)&#x200B;Oh..and what 'bad news' are you talking about that would have any long term impact?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 19:47:30'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 20:36:25'] They’re still number 1 in EV’s by a long shot. The brand is powerful and there is a devoted customer base. They’re innovating in manufacturing and their capacity is growing like crazy. TSLA does more than cars, they do energy, robotics, and self-driving. Elon is weird, but he’s highly creative and intelligent. He has the ability to take ideas and make them happen.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 19:15:52'] I am actively accumulating with plans to hold for decades. There is no vaporware, that's either misinformation or misunderstanding. Maybe you can call some of these things "moonshots" but to call them vaporware is incorrect. Tesla itself was a moonshot, as was SpaceX. I don't know of any bad news, other than some people have very strong feelings about Musk. Meh, ho-hum. Even with the "vaporware" as you put it take a look at their earnings, cash, debt, growth rate, etc. I can see how some people may believe they're overvalued because they choose to look at Tesla as a traditional car company. Tesla isn't a traditional car company, and it's undervalued in my opinion. Historically every industry upsetting new technology is disparaged. Tesla is no different. I would recommend you dig deeper. Try and disprove your own theories and beliefs and see where you end up. I wish you luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 00:46:29'] TSLA is possibly one of the most frustrating stocks I’ve ever own. I held off for so long just to watch it tear up everything, citing it was overvalued . Saw it get pulled back by quite a bit, bought, then it ripped. So I was happy.But now Elon is acting like the messiah and for a company partly reliant on good image, he just loves fucking it up.Part of me thinks this will pass since people have short memories but another part of me thinks he’s actually lost it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 19:14:21'] Quiet fool! You will wake the sleeping TSLA short zombies 🧟 it’s not Halloween yet they are not ready to be awaken !
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 20:33:13'] I’m envious of anyone with enough loss tolerance to hold TSLA long term. Like, hold it into the ground.Because that’s where it’s going.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 03:21:22'] I feel like he's just trying to hold out till he actually can leave the planet, making a fortune on cheap halfass quality shit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 07:03:59'] Will TSLA be able to thrive when Musk moves on to something else? That scenario is more likely as TSLA matures. I don’t keep up, what does he own now? <15%? Don’t break out your pitchforks, I’m just think out loud.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 13:42:04'] Holding and looking forward to averaging down for the first time in a while, if this fall continues. As for vapourware, Not sure what video you are referring to or what products but here’s a list. Roadster- actually vapourware CT- in testing, many have been builtSemi- in production, delivery’s on Dec 1stFSD- although it’s not “fully self driving” it slaps tf out of most competitors and is a completely different stack than all competitors, very scalable SexBot- prototype built$25k tesla- actually vapourware You can make the argument that almost all delayed products can be blamed on cell constraints and way higher prices due to other companies jumping into EVs, but I honestly think roadster and 25k “model 2” were too far fetched and more of a hype announcement than anything. With that said I’m very confident they will be launched eventually, along with a van of some sort.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 03:14:13'] When bitcoin was falling below 17k Elon pumped it again. Same with stonk comment on GME. Lot of people have lost their money due to him supporting these scams.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 23:11:24'] TSLA is a good buy at $200 but market crash is about to happen and Elon can’t stop with the negative press it will continue to fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 23:34:32'] Starting to dip my toes in now. Not because it’s good value, or a great company on fundamentals, but because when there’s a rip it goes hard! Like really hard. Just look at tesla during the month of September 2021, March 2022 or June 2022. You need to position yourself at least a little bit to be ready for those rips
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 03:56:35'] Majority investors are stuck if not on the fence. Exceeding capital loss limit of >3K by a large margin. There must be a reason to unload besides creating tax losses. The large losses suggest more and more people feel it is just a car company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 09:09:42'] Bill Gates Net worth is around 132b. With Tesla being 2.27% of the S&P500, could it be that he holds 22b in SPY and his portfolio Manager shorts companies, which valuation he thinks are unsustainable?   Would make sense from a Wealth preserving perspective.

It really comes down to what these investors think Tesla is actually worth as a company.

POST_TEXT: b'https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1666479033817653249?s=20\n\nIt is well known that Amazon, AMD, Facebook, Google and even Tesla are developing TPUs specifically for training larger AI models. However Nvidia does have a software moat as most of the current development is done via CUDA. What do the others need to do to take away NVIDIAs dominance ?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:32:06'] NVDA isnt sitting on their hands either.  They're innovating.  Will others catch up to their current h100?  Sure eventually.But where will NVDA be then?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 22:14:57'] Literally can say that about EVERY SINGLE market leader in EVERY CATEGORY!!!  Duh!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:29:03'] This question could have been framed much better if not around an Elon tweet lolI’m bearish on NVDA just like I’m bearish on TSLA. They’re both massively overvalued, but they are both worlds ahead of their competitors in terms of their operations. If they lose their dominance it will be from their own missteps more likely than the threat new entrants, IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:32:47'] Nvidia could win the AI battle and it still doesn’t justify their current valuation
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:12:03'] Now go tell that to the $400+ bagholders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:35:57'] Tesla also won’t dominate forever, probably not even till 2025. Elon need to focus on his business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:28:04'] Time. Example intel v amd..except the companies you mentioned are for the most part loaded. So maybe it won’t take as long..Nvidia’s to lose
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 01:01:35'] The problem with Nvidia is the same problem you get in every single market: high volumes and high margins attract competition and investment. But worse, because you're in tech and you're only as good as your latest products. Companies very often get complacent when they are market leaders (see Oracle, IBM, Intel recently).AMD was never lured to fight much Nvidia on the peanuts of the gaming market, they never made any money on pc GPU, but this may change with AI. Intel too has recently started competing.Point is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.Anybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:57:42'] Tesla can't even make a door and a fender line up properly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 12:28:06'] Aren't losses expected as companies transition to EV production? It must require a massive capital investment to retool production to meet EV design and production. Of course, there will be losses when capital is spent. This article seems like bait for those with axes to grind against EV. Or am I missing something?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:49:27'] It’s weird this is reported as loss and not R&D.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:13:49'] When tesla went through their production hell, they were losing 800M a Quarter (close to 2017 time frame).  They were trying to ramp to 5000 cars a month, and the losses were staggering on a per car basis. They were going roughly 1k-2k/mo during the production ramp that had the worst amount of losses.The same story here, but with already over 5k a month in EV production, and they were already ahead of the curve in terms of losses per EV and ramp speed. this should translate into massive profits 5-10 years in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 12:22:30'] EVs are still the long game. Tesla took a long time to become profitable too, the difference is Elon can get away with it and Ford can not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:57:33'] My plan is to gobble up at much $F as I can while the price is below $12 for two simple reasons:1. US Govt has shown that they will not allow Ford to fail under any circumstances.2. Fleet vehicles are where the money is. Think about what vehicles nearly every level of government uses. I don't know the market share numbers, but I would guess it's 80% Ford nationwide. When the big shift to EVs happens, those government fleets will be at the front of the line. Gonna be outrageous for the shareholders.I'll be the first to admit I'm no expert, and none of you should take me at my word. Just something to think about while you're out driving around noticing how much money your government spends on Ford products.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 12:29:21'] Long $F
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 22:34:50'] Sound like electric vehicles are just being forced to be used, and folks aren’t seeing good return on investments in it.I see no incentive for me to change my habits, and I think if these companies can get to me they can get to other, so marketing seems to be a little bad right now

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 03:31:08'] Can we just stop pushing electric vehicles so hard and let some of us continue to enjoy the classics? (Insert crying emoji)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:41:21'] As posted elsewhere, this is not that encouraging.Ford is operating in conditions where the demand and price of their EVs is stratospheric.  They'd previously implied that by charging $100k instead of $70k for their electric truck, profitability would be more than maintained.To claim now that under the best possible conditions imaginable, they still have to lose enormous sums?   That's not great.As tesla has proven, EVs can certainly be made and sold for a huge margin.  There's no (good) reason Ford wasn't able to, given an environment where demand was unlimited and price was no object.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:34:56'] Everyone used to say that as soon as the big companies started moving on EVs Tesla would be crushed.Well that's true ... crushed under the weight of all the money they're making haha.The mustang mach e has been out since 2019, it's not teething problems, they're losing like $30k per vehicle. This is a pure disaster for them.I hope they can turn it round as their future is extremely bleak right now as the ICE unit fades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:48:27'] I sure hope for their sake this is some sandbagging.  Ford has plummeted from $27 to $11 in a straight line.Jim Farley's big claims of being all about profit took a credibility hit last quarter when they had to announce production problems and inefficiencies burned over a billion dollars of assumed profits.  He put his neck on the line to say that would the last time something like than would happen.  This imminent quarter was to be his "prove it" quarter, so if it's an even bigger dud, that's not going to be well received.Maybe they're sandbagging by setting this early impression about huge losses to drive down expectations, and then they can report a bounce back quarter.  For their sake I hope that's part of it.

Ridiculous. Be competitive, don't get boinked for losses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:37:06'] LOL maybe if Ford did what they said they were going to do 2 years ago and go after price gouging dealers they wouldn't be in the hole $3 billion.

POST_TEXT: b'A longtime pessimist about Tesla TSLA +7.01%  says the shares could be headed for what he calls zombie stock territory.\n\nDavid Trainer, CEO of stock research firm New Constructs, who wrote in August 2013 that Tesla stock was way overvalued at $11 a share, said in a research note Monday that the shares have a long way to fall. The companys spectacular sales growth could be the problem, he wrote.\n\nBack in 2013, Trainer was worried about Tesla s low profitability, reliance on sales of zero-emission regulatory credits, and persistent cash burn. Tesla reported a small operating loss in 2013, but things have improved substantially.\n\nThe company is expected to report about $15 billion in operating profit for 2022. Whats more, Tesla has now generated positive free cash flow over its entire life and Wall Street projects another $6.5 billion during the second half of 2022. The total expected between 2023 and 2025 is roughly $55 billion.\n\nCheap growth capital and falling interest rates hel'

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:09:51'] Tesla still doesn’t have any good competition. People kept saying how when the Japanese companies like Toyota start making EVs it’ll be all over.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:37:48'] Probably because they have insurance who will foot a lot of the bill. And their insurance company may have reinsurance. They also have attorneys (entire law firms) on retainer who can use all sorts of legal defenses to represent their client’s (NS) interest. So basically there are ways for them to get out of some (not all) of the massive responsibility for this disaster. They will certainly pay for any fines and penalties as well as cleanup and legal fees. At the end of the day, NSC is a large corporation with many assets they can use/liquidate to pay.That’s my guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:12:59'] Norfolk recently increased  dividends- so price should be going up with investors buying in.  BP is still alive and well.  Profits pay for deregulation. Its a downward spiral.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 09:58:47'] Not really complicated. A few weeks ago, the whole country was on the brink of coming to a grinding halt and bring back the good old days of supply chain disruption until the government stepped in and forced  a negotiatiation between the Railways and unions. So big rail is too big to fail. Railways, unions, government and the economy.... All tied at the hip. Got to make sure  big rail don't fail. They have Insurance to cover disasters like this and newly issued bonds can pay lawsuits and other  expenses for a life time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 09:17:01'] I hope that the local government or individuals sue this company for negligence.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:24:07'] I used to wonder the same thing about Chemours, a DuPont spin-off that was involved in somewhat similar toxic tort litigation about 7 years ago. These cases are extremely complex and the damages unfold over decades even as the terrifying anxiety of affected people living along the Ohio River watershed are very real, tangible and immediate. Property damage is also very real and immediate as anybody trying to sell a home or farm in the area can attest. Meanwhile the Norfolk Southern remains a very profitable company, which is a good thing since a share of such profits will be needed to compensate victims for the railroad’s negligence, assuming it can be adequately proved in a court of law. The American legal system is not perfect and the wheels of justice turn very slowly. Ultimately no amount of money is adequate compensation for the injury and loss of life, livelihood and serenity once one can no longer drink or bathe or breathe or plant seeds or raise animals, pets, or children without reasonable fear and worry. Corporations hire the very best attorneys to protect their interests which are considerable in a capitalist system. Don’t expect the stock market to reflect your outrage for an organization, system or company that while professing safety engages in unfathomable risktaking that jeopardizes lives and livelihoods far removed from corporate HQ or shareholders. If you expect the stock to lose a substantial portion of its value over the next few weeks or months then you must actually demonstrate how the “accident” is likely to impact the company’s earnings over the next 2-5 years. Aside from somewhat greater legal expenses and meager attempt to mollify/compensate a few of the most obvious victims in the immediate vicinity of the accident, I don’t see anything to cause the earnings prospects of the company to greatly suffer. A railroad is a very profitable franchise. It’s not as if trucking is a substantially safer or cheaper alternative.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:22:28'] Let's assume the absolute worst case where the company has to basically buy every single person's home in East Palestine Ohio (4,800 residents). At a 3-person average US household size - that's 1600 homes at say $250k per home (which is above the $100k-$200k range on Zillow currently). That comes out to $400 million in damages.  Let's also say hypothetically it buys up all the infrastructure too for another $400 million.  The rail is self-insured up to $75 million in 3rd party damages and is covered to up to $800 million by insurance specifically for incidents like these per their 10-K. This means even at that absolute worst case the rail only needs to pay a $75 million charge, which is somewhat marginal compared to its market value of $55 billion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:39:27'] Damn this was a good question.. I'm naive for thinking this, but when reading your question, I was thinking how right you were.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 11:56:03'] The 6.6% move is a significant move. That’s about $3B in market cap. I don’t think people understand the scale of the company compared to the costs it’ll see from clean up efforts. A portion of costs will likely be covered by insurance which other other people have outlined. For some perspective the Lac-Megantic rail disaster back in 2013 was one of the worse rail disasters in recent history with 48 deaths. The settlement for victims was $338M and I have seen clean up cost estimates around $200 to $400M. No one died in the NSC derailment but there will likely be many long term affects so maybe it’s comparable. So I think the opinion that NSC’s stock hasn’t reacted appropriately isn’t really true.In my opinion the real threat to the company comes from increased regulatory scrutiny around PSR as that has been driving higher profitability at the rails. If the companies have to walk back some of the changes made and increase head counts that could be significantly more costly in the long run than this disaster.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:18:24'] It's likely cheaper to clean up after (even including lawsuits) than to invest in safety beforehand. This is why large companies get bad reputations. And that's what the shareholders want - at least, that's the way it looks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:18:49'] Maybe they had sufficient insurance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:58:31'] I assume their insurance will pay out for most of the disaster. As far as the PR hit, they aren’t really a company that relies on PR.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 16:13:42'] It’s about cash flows. This event certainly inks a new liability on the balance sheet; that is known. The cash amount of this liability is not. Further it’s tough to assign any meaningful value to it much less a particular date when it becomes due. Hence, no near-term change to cash flows, then nominal movement in the share price - in general.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 18:45:37'] Suprised me, too.  Just a tiny downward bump.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 20:53:27'] The company were not the ones who decided to burn all the vinyl chloride, which is what turned a bad derailment into an ecological disaster.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 21:14:36'] I ask the same thing, but usually in reverse. Like in this case, is the railway disaster indicative of the companies ability to function and make money? Will their ability to transfer materials by rail diminish over the course of 10 years because of this? If not…. They why do I care about this one off occurrence? That would be like betting against an athlete winning a game because they broke their leg in high school. Look at BP. If you invested during the oil spill, you would have done well over these past couple of years
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 07:52:50'] Stock price is based on projected earnings. If the main investors do not think a story like the derailment and it’s side effects will end up with the company making a smaller profit and their calculated evaluation, or their share price, will not be diminished. So why sell? The psychology of a mass sell off when a public story hits the news is mostly only for highly popular and well known stock. How many common retail investors think of trains as an investment as compared to retail that invests in Amazon or Tesla? The emotional, inexperienced investor sells based on the news, so the less sexy your stock, the more stable it can be in times like this.Plus they are going to get away with it, they have insurance for this very reason. If they get sued or have fines to pay, it’s all taken care of before it ever happened

That doesn't absolve them from all liability but it does get them away from some.This derailment apparently happened when a wheel assembly overheated and likely seized. These are called, "hot boxes," since the steel gets so hot it glows bright red. The steel melts together because it's similar to welded steel. Unless someone can prove negligence, they will likely have the defense that it's a naturally occurring phenomenon sometimes, no mater how careful they can be. One can assign probabilities but can't really forecast which wheel assembly is going to seize. They probably have tech to monitor these things but even they aren't 100% reliable as the event can happen quickly.

If over the next month we saw a bunch of train wrecks causing massive damage (most people understand that these trains transport dangerous cargo, but how else are you going to transport it with 0 risk) then maybe you’d get a bigger drop. All in all the damage is obviously bad and is going to take a lot of money and time to clean up, but it’s such an abnormal event with widespread blame there’s no reason it should cause panic sell offs.

Look back to the 2 almost strikes we had recently...this may well be related to the lack of funding and safety protocols.  As to why they didn't lose value, idk.  I thought they would tank.  I also thought UAL would go down after some of the recent issues I've read about with pilots nose diving and nearly crashing before correcting altitude.  Wait was that AAL.  Either way, the stock market baffles me at times.  My crystal ball sucks lol 😅
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 21:21:56'] For the stock to go down, you have to assume that there will be negative consequences.This disaster will not lead to new regulation, the company will get no more than a slap on the wrist and the politicians will disappear once the photos are taken. East Palestine doesn’t send a delegation to Davos, so they don’t matter. And until democrats hold both houses with a supermajority, the WH and the courts, no meaningful regulations will come out.If anything, the stock will go up and it’ll be. Haines as usual.It would take a chemical disaster some place where it hurt them to matter. Like if that spill happened in Chevy Chase, MD, or on Jeff Bezos lawn. That would prompt a full response.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 04:27:37'] There's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen so there may ultimately not be any serious ramifications. Still, I agree the market is mispricing this disaster. The only reason to give is something everyone should learn. The market is incredibly short sighted and underprices risks that aren't on the immediate horizon. In this case, the lawsuits will take a while to work through the process so there's likely no monetary impact for a couple of years. That's well beyond the timeframe of what stock investors care about. When it becomes a more immediate concern, people will care.I'll point you to the 3M earplug legal woes as a perfect example. Many people warned a long time ago this was going to be a big deal. Stock investors and analysts however didn't care until much more recently. There are still analysts that say it's no big deal.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 07:22:58'] It's a $50 billion+ market cap company. Even if the damages are in the billions, that's still not a huge hit to the overall company. Let's say that it's $5 billion paid over 10 years. With TVM, the hit of that really translates to about $3 billion in present value. 3/52 is about 6%. So if that's what the damages look like, it might make sense for the stock to drop about 6%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 07:28:21'] I would not touch the stock. You can buy other railroads for virtually the same exposure without any lawsuit risk. Norfolk will underperform the other RRs for years.

POST_TEXT: b"Cathie Wood gets a lot of criticism, some of it justified. (I wouldnt want to hear my fund manager say they are guided by a religious deity, either.) That said, she has had plenty of victories, and she seems to have an explanation for her various investment decisions.\n\nIm not trying to start another Wood trash-fest, but I have noticed something a bit interesting: Some of Arks big moves seem to be delayed to an odd extent, and sometimes almost seem like reactions to changes in the stock price.\n\nPerfect example is Palantir: Its been mainstream knowledge for a while that they are trying to innovate in the area of AI, machine learning, and big data analytics.\n\nAnd Cathie was well aware of them  [her fund sold](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ark-invest-sells-palantir-shares-for-123-million-buys-tesla-2022-2) after a disappointing earnings report last year.\n\nToday I see the headline: Cathie Wood Makes Whopping $43M Palantir Buy After Stock's Massive Surge. Why would i"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 09:15:09'] For me, Wood exemplifies the type of trader/fund manager whose success and failure will depend almost entirely on how well macroeconomic conditions fit her particular method/philosophy. She's the type of trader/manager who will look like a genius when markets reward her niche, and look like an absolute dunce when they don't. I don't have much confidence in her ability to provide consistent returns over the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 08:33:55'] She buys momentum but often gets left holding the bag when the music stops
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 08:21:14'] She’s all but daytrading. She has a trading fund, not an investment fund.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 16:10:29'] One thing to note, she runs an ETF. The mission of an ETF is to give exposure to an underlying sector REGARDLESS of market sentiment. Different from a fund manger trying to maximize returns
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 17:14:12'] Cathie credits God for inspiring her to start the fund and causing her to have enough conviction to put her money on the line to do so. ARKK has teams of researchers that make the actual stock picks; it's not guided by a religious deity. Although, maybe it's performance would improve if it really was just Cathie praying over a list of companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 07:35:09'] One of the great mysteries
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 11:32:59'] I do feel like people talk like SHE is buying things, when they are going in ETFs.    Like.... if there was a market for an ETF for companies that start with the letter E and it contained enron, I mean, that would be bad. But it would be bad for the guy who wants to invest in E stocks via an ETF, not like, the guy who made the ETF did it wrong. Like there is clearly a market for stupid garbage tech bro ETF, people buy it. She is putting the correct stocks in the stupid garbage tech bro ETF, and correctly doing her role in it. They are just bad investments for the people that invest in that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 16:50:36'] Wish she’d have more conviction in the companies she chooses to invest in, rather than buying the highs and selling the lows. I (on paper) lost a decent amount of money with her.I really do agree with her disruptive innovation focus, which is what compelled me to invest in her funds, but her execution has been terrible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 14:32:41'] I’ve often felt this too, but never had the data to verify my thoughts. But yes, I’ve often felt that her timing was strange too. Almost amateurish. For a fund that large and having so many very intelligent people working for her, why are they making such terrible decisions?Someone above mentioned Ark being a genius if they’re right. I sometimes think that since they have so many smart guys working for her, that I must not see the whole picture and that I’m missing something.Honestly, I think that they’re just doubling down on bad decisions and are really bad traders. And if Macro turns around, everyone will say they’re geniuses.I personally expect 10-15 years of underperformance for her funds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 17:56:29'] You all miss the obvious: every loss on Wood’s part is COMPLETELY intentional.She cares about the eternal soul of anyone who buys ARKK shares. She demonstrates this by honoring Luke 18:25 in which Jesus states: “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God" So she sees to the salvation of ARKK shareholders… by making them poor.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 14:11:06'] She's not in a position to buy and hold because of promises she's made about performance for the next few years. After last year's disaster, the fund needs to show some progress. So churn away it goes. All about the fees anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:47:20'] Looking at her picks from my sector, I really doubt her ability to research, understand and determine market fit for these growth stocks.Her biggest success was a meme stock in Tesla. (P/E is ridiculous however you cut it, powered by a rabid personality cult fanbase).The only difference between her and your regular Joe, is that her team is better equipped to understand laws and macro conditions/expectations.Is that worth the fees? To me , no.  Some, maybe.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 09:43:06'] She does not work alone and maybe the lower people dropped the ball?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 16:45:05'] Cathie Woods is not the next Peter Lynch and I would argue the era of the the rock star money manager is over. Few, if any, have been able to beat the market consistently over the past decade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 17:42:57'] She invests for a five year window… but every day the 5-year goalpost moves back one day. She never has to win until she does!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 17:51:08'] Honestly, it seems like she's trying to trade momentum ahead of sentiment.It worked all of once, but chasing the gains like this is a great way to lose a lot of money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 01:55:29'] I don't' think any fund manager care if they make or loss money.  All they care is people buy their fund.  Because they dont' make money from having good return.  They make money from having a high asset under management.So essentially, they'll spend most of their time try to promote their funds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 04:02:53'] Part Of the reason is the news you see come out with delay. It doesnt mean she bought yesterday

Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco’s new eDaily van… an electric version of Iveco’s normal (gas powered) eDaily… the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe. Anyways check back in with me in 2025 and 2030… things will be different

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 07:20:01'] Starter comment: I wasn’t sold on an EV until I test-drove a Tesla. I placed an order the same day. My speculation is that this Hertz order will be huge for Tesla beyond the revenue from the order itself in that it can introduce tens of thousands of customers a week to Tesla cars, which may help drive sales. Furthermore, 100,000 extra EVs on the road driven mostly by tourists renting cars may encourage more destination chargers, more charging infrastructure, etc. in areas where these cars are being rented.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 08:55:59'] I though Hertz went bankrupt
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 07:39:02'] The fact that Hertz CEO, Mark Fields (former Ford CEO), chose to pay full price and willing to wait 14 months for Tesla speak volumes. Hertz could easily split the order to like 50k Tesla, 25K Mach E and 25k ID4. They could get huge discounts but chose not to buy from Ford, VW or GM. Hertz did their deligience that not only Tesla is a huge draw, but the total cost of ownership is lower than all the legacy EV. But at the same time, if any customer renting a Mach E is stuck in the middle of nowhere because Electrify America chargers broke down, they would not rent from Hertz again. Tesla's supercharger network is a huge moat and any other rental companies buying non-Tesla EV will have to face. While Tesla is supply constrained for years to come, putting many more drivers who get to drive Tesla for the first time will just light the fire on more demands for Model 3, Y and Cybertruck. Very few people who drive a Model 3 will think about buying Camry as their next car. TLDR. Competition is not coming, unless you think you know more about car business than Mark Fields.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 08:36:24'] My uncle is an avid Tesla hater. Seeing him every time he visits and Tesla continue to still be dominant is a subject he avoids particularly since I've made a killing on it and find every reason to bust his balls about it.The fact is, Tesla isn't going away. You're going to say the evaluation is too overvalued. Fine. That doesn't change the fact that if you think Tesla is staying at a $900 billion market cap for the next five years, you're not understanding the trajectory of how markets work. People have a FOMO which will only drive Tesla higher. No one wants to sell and many want to buy. The few doubters are those who still think GM/Ford/VW have a chance. Do they? Sure. But they are wayyyy behind in just about everything outside of manufacturing expertise. When those idiots say they plan to go fully EV in the next decade while Tesla's fully EV fleet continues to grow with more factories expected to open by EOTY, you're in trouble.Note: 100k Tesla's is going to be 15% of all Tesla's deliveries this year. This is no small amount.The next step is to get Tesla's tax credits out and to install more EV charging across the states. Malls are dead but I do believe they can be revived if people looked at malls as all-in-one shopping centers while they charge their EV. And the people complaining about the EV charging could easily install an EV charger if they own their home. EV charging is largely going to only be an in-demand need for those who live in apartment units without access to an EV charger in their home or long-distance travelers. The average person who owns an EV shouldn't have an issue charging their vehicle if they can install an EV charger. With the rising costs in gas, I expect more people to consider switching to EV's for next year than many other years. When you see gas trickle up near $4-5 gallon, it's time to consider an EV.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 15:13:14'] It makes a lot more sense for Tesla to buy them out since they like to operate in vertically integrated model. Tesla needs dealerships, Hertz can provide a lease to own program for each Tesla leased, sold, rented.Also, If a person doesn't have a car to work for uber or Lyft they can rent it or lease it. The operator doesn't have to worry about the regular upkeep of oil changes, serpentine belt, radiator fluid changes. Insurance? Tesla has them covered it actually makes a lot of sense. Mileage? Electric motors run forever without the extensive work of a traditional combustion engine.Thanks for the update.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 16:59:06'] It's a smart move.  I don't know about the specific purchase agreement but Hertz can potentially monitor the driving behavior of all the renterer and charge them appropriately, thus keeping the fleet in good driving condition for a long time.  Oh, btw, given a choice who doesn't want to rent a Tesla for a weekend trip?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 17:31:33'] Tesla bull here.I believe Tesla can totally dominate the market because they are so vastly ahead of the competition. The problem with Tesla is that they need to improve their quality of builds and the electric charging grind of the USA. If things pick up and the competition can't win, the stock can easily shot up to thousands of dollars per share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 17:36:32'] Could be wrong, but most who people rent cars would prob prefer gas so they can drive further distances and fill it up or park it wherever they choose. I’d say this is a pretty poor investment on their end. If I rented a car I wouldn’t want to be dependent on charging it at my hotel or in between stops.

I will rent from Hertz on my next trip just to try the Model 3.  I won’t be alone.  More rental companies will order EVs from Tesla for their fleets.

Don’t electric car owners all usually get chargers installed at their homes or in garages or something? Seems inconvenient for a rental.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 11:49:27'] I know everyone keeps saying the valuation makes sense because they are so much more than a car company.  The latter part may be true (but even then the valuation on the other sectors of their business still don't justify the price per growth).  It really doesn't though.  Just think, if TSLA somehow gobbled up the entirety of GM, F, and HMC market share (which 100% won't happen) they would see their annual revenues increase from the current $46B to an astounding $449B (that's almost 10X their current market share).  Sure lets somehow say that happened, using their current profit figures of $3.5B gross income generated from $46B in sales (7.6%), that means they would generate roughly $34B in profit annually (that's more than GM, F, and HMC combined currently).  Even with those astounding numbers it would take TSLA 30 years to earn that valuation in profits.  ALL of that assumes TSLA puts GM, F, and HMC completely out of business and takes all of their market share.  Once again that won't happen.  Their software sales are not going to generate that kind of income.  Their former  president recently said TSLA is priced to perfection (that was made previously) and after todays run it's gone into pure speculation and FOMO.  I hate to be a bear because I think TSLA is a great company with a promising future, but the valuation is completely out of whack at this point.  There will be a rug pull at some point and I'd be willing to bet it happens in 2022 as rate hikes and inflation becomes a bigger talking point.  I'll be trimming almost my entire position at this price.  Can't complain about the returns this far but I want to see this come back to reality before getting back in.  Just my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 11:57:44'] tesla is a tech company that happens to make cars, solar panels, and batteries, but most of their value is in their technology.GM is a car assembly company and car design company with little to no vertical integration. Tesla is priced as a high growth tech company vs. GM priced as a low growth value industrial. low growth value industrial companies perform best during bear markets while high growth tech companies perform best in bull markets. They are very different companies with very different stock profiles so it is not useful to compare them to each other.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 12:09:59'] GM has caught and surpassed Tesla's already when it comes to rate of EVs catching fire. There's been 19 GM Bolts that caught fire, compared to 60 Teslas. \~130k Bolts sold, (1/7k)\~3M Teslas sold. (1/50k)So you're definitely getting a car that's gonna self-heat 7X more likely with a GM.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 06:50:03'] The divide on Tesla's valuation is because people tend to fall in one of two camps:1. Bulls who think that Tesla will maintain strong growth and margins2. Bears who think Tesla's growth rates will slow and margins will start coming back towards industry normsOP here is clearly one of the bulls who think they can maintain good growth and margins.  Personally, I think they do have a number of potential headwinds in maintaining those.The good news is that their success in 2021 and share price drop means they are nowhere near as overvalued as they were before.  They are also likely to be able to grow nicely for the next couple of years.  But as time goes on they are going to see a lot of issues with competition growing and margins shrinking.  It's really, really hard to both grow sales quickly while also maintaining high margins in the auto industry.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 08:40:44'] I was both an earlier in investor in TSLA (2012) and a doubter of TSLA's valuation in 2020 when I sold my last position.I agree with you. TSLA's valuation isn't unjustifiable anymore. I wouldn't personally buy it because it doesn't seem attractively valued to me, but it's also not unjustifiable if you really believe in what they're doing.What I would add though is that most people betting on TSLA in 2020/2021 were just wrong. TSLA wasn't a technology story, but a margins story. There margin's are extremely good for a automaker and when combined with their growth a high multiple is understandable. How much more growth they have left and whether they can continue to expand margins is what concerns me. My guess is that everything that has allowed TSLA to demand such a high relative valuation today is going to be against them in a few years. Growth will slow, margin expansion will stall or decline, their technology advantage will narrow, etc. It's going to be difficult to keep justifying that multiple with those headwinds, although if they can continue to grow at a decent pace it's quite possible they'll mostly grow into their current valuation. Still, this isn't a good risk/reward profile for an investment so either way I won't be investing, but yeah, it's not unjustifiable anymore, but still probably 3-4 times above where most would consider fair value is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 04:44:08'] I don't think the rate at which they are growing now is the issue. It's what happens when the competition eventually catches up to making electric cars, which is already begining to happen. Tbf, Tesla will still have the upper hand for the next 5 years or so, because of their advantage is battery production.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 05:41:05'] I think what I see repeatedly missed is that manufacturing companies making large physical products don’t operate like straight up tech companies when it comes to scaling up. If you want to ship 1,000,000 more cars, you need 4,000,000 more tires, 5,000,000 more seats, etc.  You need all that product to be available (factories are short handed everywhere and raw materials are not infinite), to ship (rail and ocean freight capacity isn’t infinite), and be produced and ship out.  Making millions of cars is complex and hard, and new obstacles come in as you try to make more cars.  Where and how are you getting all that raw material and all those people to make the product?   You can’t ship 2,000 cars in a shipping container like you can with a phone.  The cost to move a shipping container has gone up over $15,000 each in the past year and a half, depending on where.  I would contend that its value remains totally out of whack when you compare it to the business.  It’s impossible for it to be worth that much.  I think the case to be made of its “worth” relates more to the nature of markets and how tethered they need to be to “reality” in the first place.  It doesn’t matter what the business is worth if you sell it high, right?  Digging into the financials and ignoring the physical world is shortsighted, imo, because bending metal and shipping finished goods reliably and at a reasonable cost is HARD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 07:13:39'] Is their current valuation justifiable? Sure.Am I buying automaker stock right now? Hell no. There is a huge potential bubble looming for auto with interest rates rising. If we head into another recession auto is going to be the first industry to crash and the last industry to recover. Ford went from trading at $34 per share in 1999 during the dotcam crash to $1 per share in 2009 during the financial crisis and the entire sector needed to get bailed out by the government.I'm not touching auto with a 10' pole for at least the next three years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 04:24:12'] Tesla's valuation is supported by popular opinion, that's how valuations of publicly traded stocks work. The reason many are sceptical is that no matter how you slice it (and kudos for trying) fundamental financials don't add up to the current valuation because the valuation bakes in steep future growth and innovations that are far from certain.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 06:02:07'] Alright, I have written it previously, so here is the bull case for Tesla. That requires them to sell 10m cars by 2030 (keep in mind, with current lithium mining operations there can only be 6.5m EVs yearly if they monopolize all lithium). &#x200B;Assume that Tesla overtakes VW and Toyota to become the best selling car brand in 2030. Selling 10m at an average price of $50 000 (more than the averag of VW at around 32k and Toyota at 27k) and an operating margin double that of Toyota (who is the most efficient car brand as of today) at 20% would mean $500b in revenue and $100 in EBIT. Let's say that Tesla trades at 2x the P/S valuation of Toyota, it would imply a valuation of $1000 at 10x earnings - appropriate as they would have stopped growing (there is a demand limit how many cars you can sell)  Even if Tesla becomes the best-selling car company in 2030 with higher margings, they are fairly priced as of today. Their price expects perfect execution. If you come with solar, batteries, software, FSD, robotaxies, insurance of other arguments - there is no evidence that Tesla will create a dominate market position in them. Tesla failed to deliver the FSD that was promised for years.  As there is no margin of safety with even the utmost perfect projections, margins and valuation.

Then there is Musk who can leave Tesla at any point and they aren’t a good enough business where anyone can replace him and run it like other tech giants or car manufacturers. Musk is very unpredictable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 09:21:33'] I'm curious, how do you factor in the fact that 2/3rd of car sales revenue is now in loans, and rates are going up so people will be less likely to take on loans?Also do you consider the car industry cyclical?  Something that drops after this type of cyclical bull market?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 13:42:53'] Tesla recently bought up a huge parking lot near my apartment here in Los Angeles.  This lot has literally had a for sale sign up for about 10 years, I’ve only seen it used for Christmas trees and Pumpkin Patch’s every year.  Last year I saw that it was finally bought and now in the process of building out a massive charging structure (at least 30 charging stations).This isn’t your typical car company folks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 06:38:19'] Here's why I'm bearish on this stock: Tesla, despite having navigated the chip shortage better than everyone else, is still losing global market share in the EV space. When their competitors are finally able to ramp up production, the price of lithium will go up and the price of EVs will go down. Gross margins will be vulnerable, and so will growth rates.And valuation is extremely susceptible to gross margins. For Tesla, if they fall by half, profit is zero. I don't know enough about their financial situation to say if that's likely, but a car company does not have the same economies of scale as a retail platform, and I have zero faith in their other businesses. If their priced like Amazon was in 2016, that's unjustifiable to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 12:19:46'] I don't think there's really any rational way to value this company. Tesla is a single story. There are a lot of people who think it's cool to own one and be part of the image. As long as that is the case it will maintain a premium. As more electric vehicles develop and something else becomes the cool thing there is no way it's going to maintain such a ridiculous valuation. I mean the company is basically psychology, sentiment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 14:33:22'] I think it's one of the best longterm investments someone could make. People seem to think Tesla is a car company; it is not. What other car company is working on producing robot servants? It is a future tech company.They are doing what I wish most other tech companies would do. They are innovating and inventing. Their electric vehicles were the product of innovation and they spearheaded the global switch from gas to electric.Their robots are a bit risky since we've never had anything like that and people don't know if they need them or not, but it won't end there. They will continue to release new inventions to the public.In 20 years when people are flying around with their Tesla rocket boots, they'll be wishing they got in at the current price. Though I'm sure they will come up with something better than rocket boots by then lol.Still, the markets are forward thinking. That has always been why Tesla has been so overpriced. People aren't investing for right now, they are investing for Tesla's future before its created.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:27:29'] Not sure if this info helps. But i work for AutoaNation and currently have 275 Teslas Nationwide. They are a highly valued car. Just bought a pre owned one with 100K miles and no screen for 50K$ thats market value. The public invested in tesla are like early on google investors. Tesla will stay around for a long time if they keep up the sales.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 04:51:15'] Finally a good fundamental analysis. However, you must remember that car companies are often trading at single digit p/e ratios due to stiff competition. Car sales are also very dependent on the economic cycle i.e global car sales are decreasing in recessions. Im getting more and more bullish on Tesla but im still on the fence on buying at these prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 07:53:49'] “Finally, if you still think a forward PE of 56 in the absolute worst case is too expensive”Uh, what you outlined is far from the absolute worst case.  I have no opinion about Tesla’s valuation. I wouldn’t get close to it one way or another but I love reading the “fact based” analysis (again, on both sides) that make wild assumptions like the above.  You shouldn’t price a company based only on its “rosy” worst case.  You need to also account for other risks - like competitors, supply chain issues, optimistic management projections, etc etc etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 11:02:02'] You basically assume here that Tesla will continue torrid growth, while maintaining current margins. That is the part Tesla bears dispute. Tesla bears, myself included say that growth will slow and margins will compress due to competition and market saturation. Look to Netflix as an example of what we’re talking about. Netflix has reached saturation is its major markets and serious competition has arrived. As a result is is being re-rated from a company that is valued largely on potential, to a company that is valued mainly on earnings. And the stock is now back where it was almost four years ago. Many of just just simply don’t believe that Tesla is going to capture huge market share, and maintain their margins. Auto making is very capital intensive. It doesn’t take a ton of margin compression for earnings to take as serious hit.A Tesla bull’s position is basically that Tesla is unstoppable and nobody will be able to compete with the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 13:56:14'] I'm a bull on Tesla but some corrections and thoughts:\- They didnt say to expect 50% growth from only their two existing factories. They said 50% growth in '22 overall (so including Austin and Berlin ramping up)\- Because Austin and Berlin will start producing and delivering cars, they will now need to amortize the cost of the factories against the vehicles made from there. This should lower their margins until they can fully ramp, which takes at least a year (eg into 2023)
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:22:47'] Any company’s valuation can be “justified” with the right combination of growth assumptions. The key here is how plausible the growth assumptions are. Nobody can know the future for certain, so pricing in growth assumptions to a stock is, by definition, speculative. It is a speculative bet at its core. Anything that hasn’t yet happened is speculative. P/E ratios rise when investors expect more earnings in the future—and are willing to pay for them now. Value investors generally don’t like to pay way far in advance of those earnings actually existing, while speculative investors are more willing to pay in advance. So, to buy Tesla at these prices is simply a function of how much you *expect* Tesla to grow its earnings, which may or may not happen at the price investors are paying *right now*.Any time investors are paying a higher P/E, they’re saying that they’re willing to accept less future return for the potential benefit of locking in their price now.As companies mature and slow growth, history has shown on average P/Es decrease over time. This means that investors are pricing in less future earnings growth (*NOT* revenue growth).I believe it would be reasonable to argue that paying such a high multiple is making a very high conviction bet on whatever growth assumptions you’re using—and paying for growth that is far into the future. The further into the future one is trying to predict, the less accurate the predictions are. My prediction that the weather will be clear tomorrow—or that I will go to work as scheduled—is much more likely to be accurate than if I was predicting the same for a day 2 years from now. In summary, I think the fundamental argument to *not* pay a 100-300 P/E can be justified by the simple fact that things became far less certain the further into the future they are. Musk himself said he thinks we’ll see a recession soon, which by itself will cause a re-calculation of expected sales/growth and make all the previous assumptions less valid as new information comes to light. This will cause a repricing by itself. As such, I believe it’s perfectly reasonable to say that, at a 100-300 P/E, growth that far into the future is fundamentally less certain and it wouldn’t be a good use of capital to pay for all of that growth *now*.What if Musk dies in a year? Or something else materially happens with the company? That would change the company and investor assumptions. With little margin of safety for so much pricing of future growth, Tesla stock could tank hard suddenly, since it wouldn’t have the current earnings to support it. This is basically what happened to Netflix and DocuSign.So paying this much is assuming an immense amount of risk, and investors have to take that into consideration. Risk appetite recedes in a rising rate and/or recession environment, which lowers multiples investors are willing to pay. That’s why its come down so much.

They believe in 5-10-15 years it will be worth a fortune so they are getting in now regardless of the price.For the Bears of telsa, they believe in actual valuation of Tesla and don't see Tesla getting near its current stock value in the next 5-10-15 years.For Tesla, I am more of the later.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 09:22:59'] The problem with the bull case is that Tesla is yet to bear the full brunt of competition. We dont really know how it will impact Tesla yet and it is coming in hot.I think the wise move is to avoid. If you bought Tesla long ago pre-split then probably hold. But I wouldnt open a position now. They will have a good year this year, but as the supply crunch unwinds and competition comes online, the forward picture will start to get less vibrant and investors buy based on forward projections.

You still have people highly skeptical of FSD software revenue, when FSD beta is already out there and with extremely positive reception. Tesla isn’t just a typical car company and this is becoming more clear quarter after quarter. People see the value in NVIDIAs chips for AI super computing but for some reason ignore the massive asset that is Tesla Dojo once it’s up. I challenge anyone to find me a typical car company with the ability to make ASICs and custom GPUs rivaling the best out there for their respective applications.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 05:47:55'] It seems you are arguing a couple different facts here, trying to over analyze to justify valuation and therefore render a positive forward outlook on Tesla. The biggest issue with Tesla, regardless of valuation, is that every other car maker in the world is now coming after them, and all of those car makers have centuries of better car making knowledge than Tesla. People constantly overlooked the fact that Tesla’s are consistently rated near the bottom in reliability and near the top in number of manufacturers defects. They simply aren’t wonderful cars leaving themselves exposed to other manufacturers that make better looking and more reliable cars. And while and one car company may have an upward hill to climb to catch them, the entire industry will immediately put immense pressure on the company in the next 24-36 months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 10:54:49'] Nonsense, Tesla non-car business is shrinking not growing, and Musk admits to out-sized supply chain problem that unlike Tim Cook he was not able to lick. So Musk has projected a rather poor 2022 and by the end of this year he will have twice as much competitition to deal with in the SV market, even as he seems to have lost interest in SV's, not even mentioning any new models, because he has no plans for any.INstead he has a prototype robot that doesn't work that he wants you to et enthused about. Plus a landing on Mars and what else, Dogecoin?  THose are all unsound investments to say the least.   So I see him as kind of like Howard Hughes at the same age, wildly over-rich, self centered, immature, quirky and impetuous and so selfish he will just do whatever the hell he wants whenever he wants and doesn't care how crazy he seems.TSLA is the most overvalued stock in the market, priced bout 300% above Toyota and any kind of fair value.  Its skyhigh PE is supposed based on a future where Tesla grows at over 100% per year. They will be lucky to grow by 20% this year, and so even with a big premium from his fan club TSLA shouldn't be more than a 40 PE which is about a 55% haircut from here. But more fairly TSLA deserves a 30 PE or a 70% drop.Musk fans also say he had no choice but to sell ten billion in stock at the highs. yes he did. he just doesn't want you to think about the fact he knows his own stock is grossly overvalued.  At least not until he tweets another brain  fart and tells you it's overvalued, or that Dogecoin is worthless and a scam, or that he really doesn't want to run TSLA anymore he has better things to do, like land Androids on Mars.Also, AAPL has double the profit margin as TSLA, 43 to 21, and it makes what Tesla makes in one quarter in about five days.  So why then is TSLA valued at about 33% of AAPL? makes no sense. Plus if Apple enters the car market they will take a big piece out of Tesla's hide.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 11:03:06'] The market is speaking, almost every stock is up, and AAPL is up 9.5%.  TSLA is flat and down to 830.  IMHO, TSLA will not be investable until it is below $500 plus they have to announce new car models and stop accepting Dogecoin and acting like idiots.

I’ll assume you’re mostly correct and they’re not *that* over valued. If that’s true what is their moat? I think it’s the self driving, but I’m not sure. Without it and other revenue streams it’s just a car company. There is no car company out there with the type of value and market cap that tesla has. I think this forward P/E hinges entirely on developing efficient, safe, and functional autonomy in their vehicles. If they do it and force other auto makers to use their proprietary software/hardware then they will reap enormous gains IMO that will make $1000/share seem like a value. I might be wrong but that’s how I look at this company in the present as far as value. It all hinges on that for me because otherwise it’s just an EV maker + other shit and the value will come down. P.S. Playing devils advocate here because I am a believer in this company who tried to get family and friends to invest when it was like 10 dollars a share and wow did they miss out (100x on your money in less than 10 years are you kidding?) wish I had money at that point in my life to buy in when I saw the writing on the wall, maybe I’ll catch the next big thing.

Or do you only take the FCF number of the last quarter as denominator?\n\nSo free cash flow was **$3.3B** in Q3-2022, **$0.6B** in Q2-2022, **$2.2B** in Q1-2022 and **$2.8B** in Q4-2021, those 4 FCF numbers combined gives **$8.9B**.\n\n**With current market cap of $649B, does that mean current P/FCF is** (649/8.9=) **73?** Or do you take only the FCF number of the last quarter which would give (649/3.3=) **197** which is even more extreme.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 14:08:13'] What do you want to use this number to? I often see investors get "number-fixated". they simply geek too much down into the numbers without actually looking at the business and first understand the product and technology that the company is offering. In Teslas case this is much more important: from numbers alone you have no change of getting a sense of the market share that Tesla has the potential to capture - you have to understand it strengts in product and technology like FSD, AI, vertical integration etc. In Teslas case these numbers - like P/E and P/FCF are close to worthless. Let me ask you this - how useful would these numbers have been in the middle of 2019 (right before Tesla grew more than 800% in one year). The answer is that they were useless.

Tesla is literally all over every single aspect of this industry.There are also some other great channels to be found on YouTube, like [Munro Live](https://www.youtube.com/@MunroLive) for EV and battery teardowns or [The Limiting Factor](https://www.youtube.com/@thelimitingfactor) for extremely detailed videos on battery technologies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 09:57:37'] Start by knowing its a scam not only is it physically impossible to transfer to EV in a couple of years, also lots of the companies that are trying to produce EV cars don’t make profit nor will they stay in business, it’s a EV bubble being propped up by government grants and corrupt politicians.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 07:01:20'] I bought FDRV and just keep tabs on it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 08:28:26'] I don't know much, but if I was looking to investigate further it would be in non lithium batteries.  It only makes common sense you can't have mass adoption of any product if the stuff to make it go is so expensive.  The stuff that is MOS expensive of the battery part is lithium.  So that leaves either:  1.  Non lithium batteries or 2.  Better recycling of all the current lithium batteries out there (circular).  Also, look into energy storage systems.  Look into nuclear, hydrogen, and renewables.  Look into any tech to improve the electric grid to prepare for so many EV transport.All just complete guesses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 08:41:28'] Learn the current auto industry first. Learn the makings of what ices (internal combustion engines) do and what the advantages and disadvantages are. Maybe you already do, can’t tell from your post. YouTube is an amazing resource. Then learn how electric cars work. Again, YouTube is an amazing resource. Learn what works about EVs and doesn’t. Learn what practices are used and which aren’t — and, critically, why(?).  You’re smart enough to know how to ask the question. That’s a compliment — it’s meant to be. Follow those steps to have a deeper knowledge of the EV industry. You can’t understand competition until you understand the product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 11:48:30'] It's not the 'next big thing' in the sense that it is already happening. However the no. EV's you see on the road will massively increase in the next 5 years, it's already happening with EV growth in every single industrialized country sometimes doubling every year like it is in China. So it's certainly a good thing to invest in.I have money in Tesla because they have strong financials and good growth outlook. People have been concerned about them cutting prices but theyre going to be selling more cars as the EV market gets bigger which should even things out + it really hurts the smaller EV companies as they have to compete with lower prices while having much worse financials. The main drawback to Tesla is the high stock price imoAll the major automakers are transitioning to EVs/will be very soon so you can look at those too. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 06:53:30'] Who’s in the running to be the biggest or best provider of charging stations is one interesting question in my mind. Who will be the biggest or best innovator in battery technology would be the other question I would be keeping tabs on. In my mind looking for the company positioned best in terms of charging stations means you don’t go too risky on which manufacturer will compete with Tesla in the very challenging vehicle market. Anyone have thoughts or answers or already researched those questions?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:05:53'] I would study the batteries, how they work what they are made of where that comes from, and what could happen to change the game.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 16:19:51'] - valuation. according to Rob Arnott, Tesla's valuation assumes it will sell as many cars as Toyota with profit margins like Ferrari. it's implausible they'll reach anything like those numbers. - competition, the disruptor being distrupted like happened to Palm Pilot and BlackBerry, and innumerable other companies. legacy carmakers are selling more EVs than the EV specialists. - Elon being kinda unstable and somehow getting forced out or hemmed in by the board, companies can stumble when the obsessive visionary founder dies or steps down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 17:36:48'] Literally everything has to go right for them to justify their current valuation, including every other auto maker in the world essentially going out of business by 2030.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 16:04:33'] a genuine question here… how are these not applicable to any other car manufacturer of EVs, besides Elon? my point being, these may be fair risks for Tesla stock, but are they not fair risks for other car company stocks?

The 'market' for EV's is growing as the shift from ICE to EV happens however i suspect rising cost of lithium and Nickel will have an impact on EV adoption in the short/medium term as the affordability of EVs is still out of 'reach' for most people on the planet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 17:51:10'] I guess I don't see any of these as serious risks. TSLA has the best manufacturing technology in the world and is improving with each factory.  Margins will expand rather than contract.  Also I don't see battery tech as a big risk.  Other car makers are way behind.  Last but not least Elon might get spanked but I don't see that as an impediment for the company. Biggest risk: self-driving software.  The big bettors believe TSLA has a huge lead in this tech, and the success of this product is anticipated in the current stock price.  If someone else beats TSLA to the punch, the stock price could take a major hit.The second biggest risk is: New models!  TSLA is starting to look like a generic car where I live.  They're everywhere.  If they want to sell more cars they're going to have to come up new models for different niches and possibly other higher end models iwth distinctive styling.Third Risk: Biden and Democrats love unions and would do anything to fuck tesla over.

People don't understand that that's obvious and that is already priced in the stock. The biggest risk is that the FDS or the new robots fail after investing a ton of cash on them. When EV growth slows down those two projects are the only sources of growth and if the stock is valued so highly is because there is high expentations on them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 19:35:21'] This may sound like I'm not being serious, but the biggest risk is that the stock is now part of the S&P 500. On average its return is likely going to track that index because of all the index and investment funds that hold that stock as part of their holdings. The big moves of the past are gone.  The company is measured against normal metrics now and any blip in the growth trajectory will rapidly  move the stock lower while good news wont move it up as rapidly.  Returns since it entered the S&P aren't much higher than just holding an index fund and recently the stock is seriously underperforming the S&P index.

But with the valuation they have, they must deliver on selling a LOT of cars. There’s also other risks like them wanting to expand into insurance industry, regulation risks with self driving, and consistent quality with ramped up production. They’re already suffering some quality control issues that need to be straightened out. I like Tesla and I think it’s a great car except the quality control sucks.

But as a Chinese I have to say I will never buy any Chinese related stock like alibaba and tencent. They are essentially good but if you know china government well enough, you will know any china company could be just easily destroyed by a document.  Xi has 90% chance to be the chairman of china for the next 10 years and what he wants to create is a so called modern high tech Sparta just like what Mao wanted before. A society that is advanced, but private capital is rare. Xi and his team basically knows nothing about how economic works and is so obsessed with communism. And sadly he’s really good at political manipulation. So basically if one day Xi demand Tesla factory belong to china government, I will not even feel surprised.

The displays recall is probably not going to be fixed by the software update, and those cars are only a couple years old. Competition from outside and themselves. There doesn't need to be any one company that makes as many ev as tsla if the other companies cumulatively produce more. If 10 brands sell 50k EV, Tesla has half a million car competition and those companies have global distribution and service centers through existing dealerships.The other, less talked about limit on their growth is the maturation of their used car market. Since growth has ramped up so fast, most Tesla cars on the road are less than 2 years old. So in a couple more years, there will be hundreds of thousands of used Tesla. Currently, there aren't that many out there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 06:10:07'] The biggest issue that hasn't been named yet is that it's already priced for utter perfection, beyond good or bad.

In the medium term (3-4 years) TSLA is the best and safest investment I see in the market, and they will hit $2000 easy within that timeframe, in fact $2500 will be quite reasonable in my view. That will be a great exit. The key to investing in these growth companies is not to be too greedy and to aim to exit when they are at the peak of their growth story. Not at the end.

This includes price drops as their two new factories ramp up.r/teslainvestorsclub for a bullish view and r/realtesla to keep things real.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 11:01:03'] The CEO is going to have to sell more shares to close his Twitter deal. Due to laws, he can’t sell his shares until after earnings in a few weeks. Most people are trying to sell before him, so that is why there is a decent dip.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 10:49:44'] Considering Tesla cars are now exploding due to the water damages after the hurricane that hit Florida and that’s not the first of the problems people are seeing with that company, I’m not so sure I’d be investing a whole lot in Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 11:16:20'] Tesla is tough for me. If they end up as only a car company, their PE ratio will definitely come back to earth. The only reason I want to buy it is the Musk factor and FOMO whatever else he cooks up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 20:53:30'] We are in recessionary environment. September was worst month in eons. So expecting TSLA of all companies to hold well during this downturn is not practical. I would say wait for earnings and see if your thesis for its business still holds intact and continue to hold as long as you believe in the business. for me there are so many more attractive options than TSLA. But I would not recommend selling it as well.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 06:24:32'] Tesla stock was at 300 as recently as a little over 2 and half weeks ago. So the drop has nothing to do with the split. They've basically been detached from the rest of the market it seems and we're only now seeing the big drops that everybody has been seeing gradually since late Aug. Crazy thing is Tesla still haven't gotten down to its 52wk low like most everybody else so we'll probably continue to see it come down more.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:32:10'] I guess I’ll play the contrarian role and just say maybe some stock picking when he’s only investing $200 is good! It’s a totally reasonable amount of money just to experiment with! See what happens. If it was 300K that’s another story but you can learn a lot watching the volatility (or downright losses) a few individual stocks might incur. Teaches you for when you have more to invest.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:19:03'] Buy another ETF dump the individual stocks and stop using a shotgun approach to stock picking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:32:39'] This is a genuine piece of sincere advice - if you are not confident in your individual stock picks that you have to go on Reddit to ask for reassurance - dump them all and go into an index fund.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:43:13'] I like stock picking too, it's a fun hobby. However it's hard, and can be an expensive hobby if you're wrong. I really highly recommend keeping around 80% invested in ETFs, finding a way to auto invest a little bit every paycheck, and not worrying too much.If you really have a few stocks you like and want to do more stock picking do it with a smaller %. Have your fun, have some upside if you're, and limit your downside if you're wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 21:44:08'] I would advice you buy only VOO until you get to a large amount. I would say 20-30k before you start investing in individual companies. VOO will get you used to the ups and downs of the markets and by the time you get to 20k + you’ll have a better understanding of the market
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:26:49'] A bit all over the place, suggest putting 75% into an ETF port and 15% individual picks 10% cash. Try and organise them separately if you can with your broker.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:38:16'] 46% is in US index ETFs (VOO, VTI and QQQ are almost identical but I don't mind the "diversification" in management and a little bit of mid small cap).I'm not gonna judge the individual stocks. We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think "gambling" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.If you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.I think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:40:02'] Can’t believe how many people think you have too many individual stocks! You know in 2023 companies like Apple, Tesla, meta, and nvidia have average gains of around 50% while the S&P is up around 15%. I think we are indeed in a world where the winners take most and you made a good decision with nvidia, Tesla, and Google.

POST_TEXT: b'FAANG (Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix and Google) may be good if you were in 2012 but you are not.

No. \n\nHere is a breakdown of why I think each company in STARS will be winners over the next decade: \n\nSofi: Millennials like me do not like banks. We like using online only platforms.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 21:09:02'] He said Roblox was undervalued, 30B market cap and loses almost 200m per quarter. Also look what happened to meta AH , no one believes in the metaverse but zuck. And if you believed in it, you should probably invest in the company spending 100B. Dollars on it over the next decade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 04:39:45'] >Sofi: Millennials like me do not like banks. Why would anyone with a brain use these shitty companies?You know that Sofi is a bank? Additionally those "shitty" companies provide loans etc. There is a reason why those companies existed since 1870s or even longer. They also lose money and SBC is more than 1/2 of revenues. &#x200B;>Tesla: Think Tesla is just vehicles? Think again. I see Tesla continuing to dominate the EV market over the next decade and beyond but also see them helping to invent some outstanding products that are not vehicle related at all.Tesla only makes money selling cars. So yes they are just vehicles. They are getting outsold in Europe by the VW Group and Stellantis - and in China by BYD. At the same time they are valued as tho they are worth more than most other car companies combined. &#x200B;>Alphabet: Today (10/26/2022) was a bad day for Alphabet (missed earnings). Don't let this fool you. Once the recession is over (I know I am just another internet stranger but I would say the recession is over in mid 2024) Alphabet will begin to soar and will as always be in almost every crevice of our lives like it has been the past 2 decades.Let's see how bad this ad cycle can get. This is at least a somewhat sensible company, even if I think its expensive. &#x200B;>Roblox: I think of all 5 stocks listed in STARS this one is the most undervalued at the moment. If you believe even a little in the Metaverse then Roblox should be your pick, in my opinion over Meta in fact.500m in loses in a year, growth slowing down and loses accelerating. 2b in revenue and close to 30b in market cap. Also that SBC&#x200B;>Salesforce: Tbh I think Salesforce when looking at everything (P/E ratio, earnings, etc) is a little overvalued. Long term this stock is a winner. This company does excellent work, I use them for my workplace all the time and no complaints.Great that they are super overvalued, growth is slowing down here as well. They have high SBC and overspend on acquiring companies. &#x200B;>. Take the advice above and tweak it. Let me know if STARS is a good investment or if it should be altered somehow.This portfolio will make more money as a short, than long in the next 3 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 03:07:14'] I am 26, so I have several decades until retirement. My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much. I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued. My last review in one of these was [Dec 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6bdjt/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/hn1ot2t/). Since then, I have made some adjustments, mostly by researching new companies and updating what I focus on when doing my analysis. I am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades (that surely won't be the case, but I'm okay with that; not all of these will be good investments, but most of them should, I think).My goal is not doing 50% in a year or buying low and selling high. My goal is to outperform the index modestly, at maybe 2-3% annually, which would compound very nicely over decades. I'm okay with the risk that I underperform at a modest rate. I want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment.I like stocks that are quality companies with:-	A sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.-	Business model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.-	A wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.-	High margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.-	Sustainable buybacks and dividend growth.-	Great management.Not every company I own scores high in each of these, but together they fit my investment goals very well.I used to have an allocation for growth in my portfolio, but overtime, I have decided to fully target quality companies and compounders with a great track record. I realized that it is never too late to buy into a company once it becomes profitable and sustainable. And if I miss a few 10-baggers because of restraint from unprofitable companies, I'll be okay with that.My current allocation is 96% equity, with the rest being a single commodity holding - a carbon allowance ETF (CARB on BIT)Of the 96% equity, 1/3 (32%) is in diversified ETFs:| **Name**                 | **Target allocation** ||--------------------------|----------------------:|| **MSCI World**           | 14,0%                 || **MSCI World Quality**           | 10,0%                 || **MSCI World Small Cap** | 4,0%                  || **MSCI EM IMI**          | 4,0%                  |The other 2/3s are stocks, structured as following, ordered by my target weight (descending):| **Name**                        | **Ticker** | **Target allocation** ||---------------------------------|:----------:|----------------------:|| **Microsoft**                   | MSFT       | 6,00%                 || **Apple**                       | AAPL       | 5,50%                 || **ASML Holding**                | ASML       | 5,50%                 || **Brookfield Corporation**      | BN         | 4,00%                 || **Costco**                      | COST       | 4,00%                 || **MasterCard**                  | MA         | 4,00%                 || **Novo Nordisk**                | NVO        | 4,00%                 || **Ulta Beauty**                 | ULTA       | 4,00%                 || **Visa**                        | V          | 4,00%                 || **Alphabet**                    | GOOG       | 4,00%                 || **Johnson and Johnson**         | JNJ        | 3,00%                 || **Home Depot**                  | HD         | 3,00%                 || **Lockheed Martin**             | LMT        | 3,00%                 || **Union Pacific**               | UNP        | 3,00%                 || **Intuitive Surgical**          | ISRG       | 2,50%                 || **Adobe**                       | ADBE       | 2,50%                 || **Brookfield Asset Management** | BAM        | 2,00%                 |Edit: I also have two retirement accounts that are both 100% MSCI World.

I personally think that I should have some money in Lowes since it's the other major home improvement chain in the US. My main goal is responsible investments with relatively low risk. Also, on the non low risk side, part of me just really wants to invest in Nintendo as I grew up with their products and the overall cost per share is relatively small. Plus they're opening a theme park and came out with a new movie. I feel like they are really starting to take advantage of their IP outside of gaming for the first time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 04:01:33'] Decided I want to reduce my portfolio allocation to individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds back into index funds. I got serious about investing at the end of 2021 (great timing I know) and while I still want to devote a small portion of my portfolio to stock picks, I admit I got carried away early on and ended up holding about 35 different companies at one point. I've trimmed that down to 28 now, but I'm still wasting too much time stressing over earnings calls and company-specific risks. Currently I have about 40% of my portfolio in individual stocks but I'd like to cut that down to 20-25% by the end of this year, though I'll hold certain positions longer if I can avoid realizing losses or paying unnecessary taxes.    After the recent mini-rally in tech I am now at break even or slightly positive on a number of stocks including ABNB, AMD, CRM, MSFT, MU, SPOT, and TTD. Seems like a good time to decide which of these tickers I should reduce exposure to, sell completely, or hold for the long term. I'm also bagholding others including UPST (-68%) and ZIM (-53%) which I'm not sure if I should just cut loose or hold and hope for better days (these were by far my worst picks at the valuations they were at).    I'm done with stock picking going forward unless I have really strong conviction in a company or I feel the risk/reward ratio is overwhelmingly in its favor and it has multibagger potential. Just wondering out loud trying to figure out my exit strategies at this point...tempted to just cut loose all the tickers I listed above at Monday open (together they make up about 10% of my overall portfolio). I'm not really trying to time the market, I just want more peace of mind by putting that money into index funds instead (though I'd likely DCA the proceeds over the next several months given the current market volatility).    However, of the stocks I listed above, I'm most inclined to keep AMD, CRM, and TTD.... AMD because I respect Lisa Su and think they'll continue taking market share from Intel and compete with NVDA for the foreseeable future, CRM because I think with all those activist investors and Marc Benioff returning as CEO the company is hyper focused on increasing profitability, and TTD because despite their lofty valuation they have a massive TAM and are destroying earnings every quarter with significant tailwinds once we get past this bearish cycle.    I'm welcome to any and all thoughts including roasting me for my previous stock picks 😂
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 02:49:02'] TLDR: $META 32%, $NU 25%, $CROX 18%, $NET 10%, $MSFT 7%, $ASO 7%I've been thinking about how to pick stocks, and what I came up with is I'm   trying to give 2 value estimates — "optimistic" and "pessimistic". Note   that I have no idea how to properly value companies, but I read   quarterly reports and try to make sense of the numbers, but mostly   intuitively. Currently, I use google sheets where every stock has   a current price and my estimates, giving me an overview of how much upside   and downside the stocks have. When I get a paycheck, I try to pick   stocks that have less downside, and more upside, and also that don't skew my portfolio   too much.Now here is about individual stocks, with my high/low estimates:- **Meta**, 300B/600B. Media mostly talks about the metaverse being a flop and Apple getting in the way of their tracking, but I think its fall to 10PE was overblown. They actually spend more money on AI than on VR, and they also said that they have good results from AI used for advertising, so they don't see Apple policies being a major problem for them.- **Nubank**, 15B/35B. I actually learned about this company before Buffett invested in it. They have interesting tech. I'm a software developer, and I love the tech stack they use (Clojure, Datomic) — it makes me feel much more productive when developing compared to other, more mainstream tech stacks like Java or Python. Also, in Russia where I used to live, before the war, there was a similarly awesome banking service (Tinkoff) that I used and loved. After moving to Europe it makes me sad to see how far behind other banks here, even the more progressive ones. - **Crocs**, 5B/13B. It was a fucking steal at 5PE ($50) in the summer. I guess it fell so much because of the debt fears and rates rising. But I still buy it even at $120. I think, with their HeyDude's acquisition, and good debt management they still have room to grow. - **Cloudflare**, 8B/30B. Quite a big spread in estimates because I'm not sure about this company. I mostly bought it because I thought there would be a lot of demand for it because of ChatGPT, and possibly other AI services that are free to the users but pricey to run, hence requiring a middleman to prevent misuse. I now see that Microsoft's newer GPT model is significantly cheaper to run, so maybe there will be less demand for Cloudflare. I'll probably sell it soon. Although they seem to be focusing on profitability, so, they might continue to rise.- **Microsoft**, 1691B/2150B. Quite safe, will most probably continue growing, but maybe not by as much as other, smaller companies.- **Academy Sports + Outdoors**, 5B/6B. Note that they currently have less than a 5B market cap, so my guesstimates say there is no downside. Not sure why I thought so, maybe they have good shareholder's equity and earnings... Anyway, it's not a bigger part of my portfolio because they might not be growing as fast as I'd like. But maybe I should sell Cloudflare and buy more ASO...Also, here are some companies I'm thinking to look closer into:- RH — though maybe will be growing only once the rates start to fall- RBLX — it's misleading that they don't earn money because they use accounting tricks to pay fewer taxes (deferred revenue)- BLDR — growing, low PE...What do you think?

But affirm does move so I’m depositing more money in to average down but buying at the money covered calls with low $9 breakevens and $30-60 max profit per trade so about $800 weekly in gains if I hit max profit.When all accounting for all my short calls and collar positions, my cost basis is around $11.50. But I think I can get it down to $9.50 within the next 3-4 weeks.

POST_TEXT: b'Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share if they execute really well. The CEO has often commented on Teslas stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \n\nIn 2020, when Teslas stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was too high. It sent Teslas stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\n\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.\n\nThis week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 08:46:24'] The key to this absurd valuation is the autonomous taxi stuff, which IMO is still a long way off.Just go drive around a medium to large city for a few hours on a Friday afternoon and tell me how this shit is going to work. I am not convinced the tech is anywhere near close to being able to seamlessly just drive around town taxing people from here to there.  Autonomous driving is a great goal and I'd love to see it work out - the amount of bad driving and traffic deaths, not to mention the insane rises in car insurance means something needs to be done. I just don't see how it is going to be feasible in a few years.  I think we are more like 15 years away from it than 5 years away .
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 17:12:39'] Man he’s really managed to PR his company literally hemorrhaging money making all their revenue selling government tax credits to being included in the S&P and hovering comfortably at a pretty consistent 400P/E retio. It genuinely feels impossible for this stock to fall in price now. It’s just forever gonna stay incredibly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:32:11'] Tesla would be $3k a share when? $3k a share would make Tesla worth \~$3 trillion, making it more valuable than Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. More importantly, it would make Tesla WAY more valuable (in valuation) than all other automakers and solar panel company COMBINE, by far.So what does Elon offer to justify that valuation? Is he rolling Space X into the fold?

Cars will be just one product AI robot they offer among other products .. WIFI at all times with starlink ..

That competition is coming (GM recall every single Bolt, Ford sold only 17k Mach E in US in 2021 so far, VW ID3/4 has disastrous sales number in China). And what happened to the past Tesla killers like I-Pace or E-Tron or EQS?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:02:58'] With other cars heavily invested in electric cars now and Elon musks persona of godlike superhero slowly turning into evil rich asshole I think Elon’s time at the top is dwindling if it hasn’t already peaked.All car companies are closer to catching up with Tesla, in 2 years time other cars will be better than Tesla with better batteries. (Fords investment into batteries etc)Whenever Elon talks about stocks or crypto I stop listening, the man is clearly out to suit his own interests at the expense of others, he will lead you on sell you the dream and then take your money and leave you holding the bag.His investments into Bitcoin made him more than Tesla, the man knows the power of the pump and dump and clearly will not stop.The man is capitalism cancer personified, him and bezos can set sail into the sun and the world would be a much healthier place.TL:DR.Elon is bullshitting you to buy a stock he wants to manipulate (AGAIN)
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:39:12'] ICE companies are playing catchup with EV and self driving technologies while more and more consumers thinking twice about buying ICE vehicles which will lose value much faster with a 2030 deadline coming close.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 08:55:28'] It appears that many people in r/investing and r/stocks have a wildly skewed view of TESLA.The TSLA to 3000 crowd seems to ignore that those margins are going to come under pressure sooner than later. Notwithstanding what Elon wants or thinks, competition is coming. Reinvestment is going to have to go up and prices across the EV market are to become more competitive. The TSLA is stupidly overvalued crowd seems to ignore that the company has solid and loyal costumer base, a reputable brand, and first mover advantage in the EV market. It certainly has a long way to go in terms of its potential market share. But remember, the car business is fierce, reinvestment is high, and unless you’re into luxury exclusive vehicles, your revenues are very pro-cyclical.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:56:27'] For any company, the market is evaluating possible intrinsic value outcomes and assigning probabilities and values to each.  The share price is merely an approximation of the expected value of these outcomes at any given time.  Is Tesla's intrinsic value presently $700 Billion?  Probably not, but when assigning weights to the possibility of bankruptcy vs. dominant EV/robotaxi/AI superpower the present expected value is $700 Billion.  For simple math, that could include a 10% chance the company is worth $7 Trillion and 90% chance of bankruptcy in 5 years.

He said that decline shows Tesla is facing fiercer competition from local EV startups.*I'd pay attention to FSD a little more after the lawsuits/refunds and if they manage to get past level 2 within a reasonable timeframe.Right now, I'd rather not invest in a company that's already priced in perfect execution when they've shown time and time again, they don't execute perfectly.

It's a premium brand and they have very poor PR and customer service while also delaying the releases of the electric semi's.Anyone looking at ARKK etf would be worried at the kinds of stocks they're holding such big % of; looking at you Unity, coinbase and zoom. If people really think tesla is going to 3 trillion then the bubble is going at some point. Maybe not this year, maybe not next, but one day when everyone has electric cars, people will stop and realise this company isn't worth even the same as other car companies.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 17:09:57'] My 2 Cents as a Noob.I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again: No offense, but it stumps me when, even Tesla owners, continue to compare a Tesla with other EVs. To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)Every Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn’t matter when it releases to the Public). Tesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. In my mind, Tesla is spelled like this “**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**”.The Competition: (1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it’s energies to moving forward in the EV-space.(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla’s capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I’m really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla’s continued progress.It is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it’s “Fan Boys” and “Fan Gals” - we are (almost?) a cult now 😉. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.My prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then).

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 13:17:47'] More like $30 a share. If they "execute" really well that is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:37:58'] The value is basically ignoring all the competition they face on the market. Yes the tech stuff is nice and all, but FSD will come from a lot of companies, and tbh I still believe that Waymo is the best option as they can literally supply anyone and still make cash. If Tesla hands out the FSD tech, they might as well kill their own car business. Battery tech is where the Chinese (CATL, BYD) and Koreans are going to lead (Samsung). Also it's ridiculous that same people believe they can keep up that growth factors until they sell like 15+ million cars a year. First of all you gotta find the double amount of buyers each year. 100-200k per year isn't that hard, especially when you have a lot of hype and fanboys. The main problem is getting the average buyer to get one of these instead of an VW or Toyota. It's getting harder from now on.

Their design decisions are…questionable at times to say the least, but we’ve seen with the phone market and now in cars that consumers don’t really care at large scales about some of that so it’s not going to affect them that much.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 10:29:50'] Ahh so Tesla will be worth $3T in a few years. That’s 3x what the entire auto industry was worth (mkt cap) in 2019, at the height of vehicle sales in world history. Today the industry is worth ~$2.5T. In 2025 it’ll be worth at least $5T if no other auto makers valuation changes and tsla reaches $3T. So 500% industry valuation increase on probably 10% increase in collective vehicle sales. if TSLA goes to $3T, rest of the automakers will go bankrupt. If they don’t go bankrupt, TSLA can’t get to anywhere near $3T

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 11:11:18'] Let's put it this way, if TSLA can actually manage to mass produce the cybertruck & the tesla semi, they will have a large market cap on the auto industry. But that won't be enough to make them a 1 or 2 trillion company.What they must do, and they do know this is to be a mass producer on battery that they can sell.And then, the big thing. They must be a provider of energy, just google top 10 largest companys on earth the majority are " gas & oil " aka energy. This is where things can change, and tesla can actually be the next generation company when it comes to providing energy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 18:06:50'] I'm buying. A lot. I think everyone who doesn't own TSLA is going to get left in the dust. In about 10 years Tesla is going to be the mega monster of all companies. If they have full self driving AND autonomous robots, then Tesla is going to have a totally robotic driverless car fleet AND robotic deliverymen. It wont be just "robo-taxis" -- it will be "robo-everything". Robots will be packing and delivering your parcels, and your food. Every warehouse and shipping system where things are moved by humans couod be replaced with Tesla bots. I don't think any company is going to be able to keep up with what's coming down the pipe. The barrier to entry will be just so huge. Its not like Ford is going to come out of left field and come up with a Dojo processor and full self driving system.If you havent seen the Dojo presentation, you should. Everyone who thinks other car manufacturers are going to be going down this same road and outmatch Tesla are out of touch.https://youtu.be/DSw3IwsgNnc
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 13:05:05'] This sub hates Tesla.  You are going to get a lot of irrational/emotional answers.  There are tons of resources out there for you to come to your own conclusion, just most of the answers here are probably going to tell you not to invest when that is probably not the right answer.  IMO if you look at the fundamentals this is one of the strongest companies in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:06:53'] If you don't want the singular risk of owning TSLA (wouldn't blame you), buy [FDRV](https://screener.fidelity.com/ftgw/etf/goto/snapshot/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=FDRV).  Newish fund from Fidelity with decent sized TSLA exposure but heavily diversified in the wider EV industry.I'm adding every Q and will hold long-term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 07:08:27'] It's 'overpriced' at a hundred bucks. I have no idea what the stock price will do, obviously, but you're essentially betting that Tesla is worth more than the entire rest of the automotive market at its current price.Does 'overpriced' mean that you can't make any money by buying it under $800? Probably not. I'd look for a better value though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:33:23'] My boy—who has a horizon of 10+ years—was incredibly bullish on TSLA a couple years ago at $575ish and thought it would get to $2k eventually. We texted this AM and he now believes it could drop to below $500. He wants out, primarily bc Musk is obviously unstable and becoming more erratic by the day. All I’m saying is that once my guy lost faith, that freaked me out. The price will go lower. I got out today & will rethink once it hits $500
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 11:36:01'] Looks at the growth of Tesla, so you think it’s stopping anytime soon?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 07:56:24'] In my book, Tesla is a buy under 600. In a bear market any slippage from Elon can seriously dent your net worth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:26:56'] I wouldn't pay $300 for it.  Tesla is way overpriced, the moment the hype ends or Musk does *even more* stupid stuff, it's going down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:35:00'] Personally, I always thought the stock was over valued for a few reasons: EV market share will diminish over time (look at Ford and Toyota in the ICE vehicle market), precious metals for battery tech are diminishing, Tesla notoriously lacks QA and so reviews for build quality have given them a blemish there as other quality EVs show up, bad press from recent battery explosions and autopilot harming/killing pedestrians, he put up shares as collateral for his Twitter bid, and finally - Elon musk is incredibly unpredictable. His recent right-wing pandering on twitter has potentially damaged his relationship with his progressive customer base. The bullish case for Tesla is that they are not just an EV company, they also provide energy storage tech, solar panel systems both commercially and residentially, and they have the most miles of road data and LiDar data out of any major vehicle producer that is working in the AI/autopilot domains - so this gives them an edge over a long horizon, but that data may be purchasable down the road from 3rd party companies. Overall, I'm bearish on Tesla as I think it has been overvalued for a long time. Full-disclosure I do not have a position in Tesla and this is not financial advice, if Elon didn't have a cult-like following I may have shorted it by now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:48:51'] Tesla is a fucking meme. I wouldn't touch it with a 10ft long barge pole

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:56:31'] Under 50 yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:52:50'] Analyst targets mean nothing. Moving averages means little with someone as volatile as Elon. A single tweet can send the stock soaring or tank it completely. I hate holding stocks like that because you can’t get a good night’s sleep, especially during a bear market.Why do you care about TSLA so much? Are there not other opportunities or are you just a pop news lemming? Every 20 years there are companies that come along that you think will take over the world, but eventually fizzle out. Blackberry/RIM comes to mind.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 14:31:50'] Not seeing many folks mention how diversified tesla products are: AI, autonomous taxi loops (even if FSD fails), battery storage systems for utility and home, cell production, cars/semi/high end EV, solar, perhaps a break into mining/wind/Air conditioning units.... And they will have no debt this year, its a no brainer that they will be profitable for years to come. Equally there's overlap in the engineering from space X and material science. They've forced the whole industry to change... They won't die overnight
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 22:45:50'] IF they successfully launch and dominate the robotaxi aspect of their business AND we see the dumbass robot transforming labor as we know it AND they end up with 25% of global vehicle sales then TSLA will be something like a $10 trilllion dollar company.That’s a lot of “IF’s”. Would be happier with the risk/reward on a 10 year outlook if the share price was closer to $500, which is around where I’d be willing to start adding again. It should be mentioned that with TSLA, the “IF’s” are actually pretty likely to materialize, kinda like APPL, you can actually count on them to make wildly ambitious goals a reality, at least more so than with any other company out there. If I had to put my money on a company catching lighting in a bottle multiple times, TSLA would be on the short list.Also it should be mentioned that things like cyber truck/$25k car/semi/aircraft will double/triple previous 5 year projections, along with economies of scale giving them better margins and the increasing price of FSD, exporting and licensing battery technology, and a million other little things that are always looming on the horizon could end up adding a lot more value than anticipated.Could be the first $100 trillion company 80 years from now who knows.Still like the risk reward better at $500/share
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:32:15'] TSLA is unable to compete in the two of the most important and fastest growing markets in the world.It is way too overpriced for most of the world and will never have mass adoption.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 07:20:35'] Seeing as they are not just an EV company, I would feel comfortable at these levels. Do I think we see lower prices in near future? Yes. But In the long term there is no beating this giant of a company. They are just getting started
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:50:01'] No. Remember that what was once overpriced will then be underpriced. So I'm not buying until under 400.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:12:45'] I would love an EV, but there's no way I can charge mine where I live unless I buy a huge extension cord and run it across a field everytime I need to charge it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:24:21'] Without Musk as CEO definitely not - too expensive IMO. But even with Musk in charge I would wait for it to go lower, especially given the increasing competition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 23:20:54'] Tesla is a great company but stock is still very expensive. There is still a lot of downside risk in the stock. Especially as competitors ramp up production over the next few years. Tesla fan boys will say there is no way anyone will ever catch tesla but one thing I have learned after 20 years in the market is don’t ever underestimate the competition. Just remember IBM used to be a leader in the 90’s and now look at them. And sorry to those of you that don’t want to hear it but not everyone wants a tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 18:08:15'] I’m super bullish on TSLA but unfortunately not on Elon. He’s become way too erratic, political and impulsive. I made really good money off of TSLA and today sold my remaining shares due to wanting to pay off my mortgage and freeing up that extra cashflow. If it drops below $500 I’ll get in again for sure. The China zero Covid policy for the next 5 yrs is worrisome. Thanks to them Q2 will probably be pretty bad… Imagine 5 more years of that lockdown bs over there. No thx.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 19:53:43'] As far as quality screens go?That'll be a little tricky as growth screeners usually look at EPS and its growth, as well as forecasted earnings and such. If that's alright, just grab SCHG and sleep easy. You could look at something like Wisdomtree's new fund, QGRW. Looks at RoA and RoE, trying to find "quality growth". Very new, but matches QQQ over short lifespan. QQQ meets quality screens instead of market cap weighting. IUS has a few more screens, also looking for quality picks. Sp500 meets quality screens instead of market cap weighting.COWZ looks at free cash flow and so probably will have higher dividends than you're looking for. SPGP weighs EPS growth, maybe sales growth too, it's been a bit since I read its prospectus. Then also screens for a discount. All of these look like good funds to the right investor. Maybe they're for you, maybe they aren't. How to know if they're for you? Actually read the prospectus for anything before buying, please. Understand the products you're buying!That last part is to everyone. It's amazing the ridiculous things you read on these subs that a quick prospectus check debunks. Good luck and happy investing!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:36:36'] Interesting concept, you likely focus on companies in the dividend yield range of 3-5%. (3M as a example). Use the cash dividend to acquire more shares and find industries that are on the brink of a shift in growth rate. That way the companies begin to prioritize maximizing growth and your fund will have many stored shares. Disclosure: I don’t own 3M
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 19:44:13'] In Canada we have total return swap etfs that are designed to not pay the dividend but just have the shares grow. So dividends just converted to growth. https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2019/09/06/horizons-swap-etfs-the-next-generation/It's sometimes recommended for our non-registered accounts so you're not paying tax every year.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla\'s valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like "Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined" or "Tesla has decades of growth priced in" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.\n\nThat said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla\'s market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla\'s trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.\n\n**For those who don\'t like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 14:59:31'] I believe 2023 will tell the tale. I mean the projected worst case is at 2 million cars sold.  My big question is: will there be enough people buying $50K cars .   Once Berlin and Texas fully ramps up: will there still be consistent appetite for $60K model Y and $45K model 3? The projected worse case revenue is $100 billion.  1) USA: To put things in perspective: Rav-4 and CR-4 sells about 750K cars per year in the USA. They average about $30K/car.  Will Tesla be able to convert  buyers of $30K rav-4/CR-V to buy 750K model Y EVERY YEAR?? It will be daunting.  they might be able to do with model Y SR: but the revenue will be lower.  Personally: between friends, co-workers, and family: I don't know anyone that drives a >$50K ~~subcompact~~ compact suv.  They all drive rav-4, cr-v, tuscon/santa fe, rogue, forester, outback, escape, etc...I am unsure how many of those folks will buy a model y in the next 3 years....If I had to guess, maybe 1 or 2.  The rest: if they trade in: they will get one of the aformentioned vehicles.  2) China:  competition is fierce: the model Y already has SR version: revenue for this will be lower.  Berlin will open up: how many $50K model y/model 3 can tesla china sell?  most of model 3 sold in china is <$40K. and model Y sr in china is only $42K. 3) Berlin:  I suppose tesla can still sell 500K model y/3 every year but competition is also fierce in Europe.  4) Cybertruck: this probably can only be sold in the USA/Canada: just too big for the rest of the world. there is a reason why #1 pick up truck in the world outside of north america is the Toyota Hilux.  I doubt Tesla can sell 1 million of these every year in the USA 5) There is a reason the market cap for all automotive (ex-tesla) is only around $1.5 trillion.  Not everyone can afford $60K model y or $45K model 3.  That's why there is a lot of corolla, civic, accord, rav-4, etc. sold.  People who look to buy these cars are not going to cross shop with model y or model 3.  The argument againststhis will be: what if tesla makes model 2?? ok, they can; but revenue will be a lot lower.6)  Competition: Model Y and Model 3 are good cars. but they are quite expensive.  Tesla can own the upper echelon of electric cars. But luxury competition is there or will be there: ie. Lucid, Rivian, Audi/Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, etc...Yes those may not be #1 but they will get some market share. Then you add RNM, Toyota, hyundai/kia, Volkswagen group, Stellantis, Honda, and a bunch of Chinese companies then it becomes even more difficult. 7) So I believe the only way for Tesla to achieve such high net income is through other means: this remains to be seen.  over 90% of their revenue is cars though. 8) Capitalism doesn't allow dominance with high operative margins consistently on things that are capital intensive (ie. cars, airplanes, boats, computer hardware, etc.).  It is software that can do that.  Tesla has to prove that it can make money in software (which they might: they have been able to convince so many people to pay $10K for FSD...will they continue to be able to do so??). 9) at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap.  To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???10) Saying all this shorting TSLA is crazy

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:25:59'] My only issue when I see bulls vs bears is "Tesla is not only a car company" but their bull case is somehow always "they're producing more cars and selling more", as evident in their recent rally and people talking about their earnings.Nothing wrong with that but it's weird for bulls to defend Tesla saying it's not only a car company when all it matters seems to be them selling more cars. Maybe I just don't understand TeslaWith that being said, I'm placing a limit order at $600 if it ever goes down that much again. I doubt it would go down that much again, but not going to FOMO at current price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 05:50:42'] I read your entire post while mentally prepping myself to write a long winded drawn out response...then I got to your last two paragraphs.All I have to say is, you're right...TSLA is pricing in a optimistic scenario with all items you have mentioned and passingly mentioned at the end. People who dont understand this are just mad they missed the party.I don't even hold TSLA, but from all my research I have done everything you have mentioned could potentially happen and justifies the large market cap at the moment. People just need to understand TSLA is priced into a "best case" future right now and one delay or hypothetical bump in the road could throw it into a large correction.Good post OP.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:29:41'] I won't get in on Tesla now because it's far too late to become one of those "Tesla Millionaires," unless I had hundreds of thousands to throw at it at least. Yet, I can't help but find sour grapes amongst some of those complaining about its success. Tesla has thrived on doubt as much as it has innovation so they need to give it up already. That's coming from someone who is as much a critic of Elon Musk as they are an admirer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:40:13'] Tesla's recent parabolic moves are far more likely the result of derivatives than fundamentals: [Bullish bets on Tesla stock reportedly made up 50% of all options trades this week as investors cheer EV maker's surge to $1 trillion market cap](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-options-bets-rally-1-trillion-market-capitalization-markets-10-2021). Trying to justify on the basis of insanely optimistic growth forecasts is a fool's errand. Imagine thinking a "worst case scenario" is doubling income from 9.8B in 2022 to 20.8B in 2024, when their TTM earnings were 3.47B. Their TTM free cash flow was 4.1B, so current P/FCF is around 267. Last time companies had triple digit multiples was the Dot Com bubble, and that worked out spectacularly well, right? Look at Cisco's chart. Still nowhere near its peak over 20 years later. A decade from now, investing books will use Tesla as a prime example of the speculative euphoria so typical of today's easy-money environment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:34:24'] The rising margin in 2 years is still pretty optimistic with more factories on line and a struggling home storage and solar business attached.  Production maintenance costs will start rising while the other factories are coming online.  No recalls priced in.  Completely inelastic demand, they sell every car they make, priced in. Still at p/e of 30 in 3 years,  best case,  at the same scale as other car manufacturers. Declining free cash flow as invested capital rises with more staff and factories.  I agree with the analysis that decades of sales are not priced in,  but I think you could also say 3 years of perfect execution is also priced in, and it's still priced as a growth company while delivering 3 million cars per year. This all assumes the stock doesn't go up another dollar over the next 3 years. This reads like dd on why this is the top for at least a couple of years, and that the stock should trade sideways for a few years, which means you could expect 0 returns by owning it based on valuation alone. I know that's not how tsla works though...What other company is priced for perfect execution? If Intel were given this trust (assuming their ambitious fabrication build out will just be successful), it would be trading at $150, but no sane investor would consider that a reasonable price, and that's a company that is already doing $18 billion per year in earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:29:28'] I just want to add that EV adoption will become mandatory (banning sales of gas vehicles) in certain countries and states in 2030 and afterwards. Tesla is definitely in a position to benefit from this more than others. Also, Tesla has already secured enough batteries for 2022 to make 700-800k vehicles. Their vertical integration is what really sets them apart from the suppose “competition”.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:37:17'] I don't care how much you want to try to justify Tesla price. If there is a crash the market will not say oh Telsa you are a value stock and will not go down much. If there is a crash in the stock market Tesla will crash hard.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:22:11'] From my experience with these things, valuations rarely matter for solid growth companies.Growth companies never get docked because of valuation, they only get docked when their growth rates significantly slowdown.Now that TSLA is a $1.1TN company, it's too late to be asking whether one should invest in TSLA or not, every SP500 and Nasdaq index fund is already holding TSLA as the 5th largest holding.TSLA also won't be able to repeat the 20 bag return over 2 years that rewarded "early" (note: listed for over a decade) TSLA investors. Their profit figures thus far have already vindicated the company, so anyone hoping for a massive sell-off is hard coping. The company might see at most a 20-30% drawdown which is in line with what can happen to any other large cap, in response to a bad report or bad macro environment. While their reports pre-2020 showed flat revenues as they had constant issues from cash flow and production... their most recent report showed that the market WAS correct in their FORWARD outlook on TSLA and priced it correctly.That's what investing is about - sometimes you don't believe in a company where you should have believed. Sometimes you believe in a company and they let you down.Remember there were many redditors who were bullish on NIO, BABA, PLTR at the beginning of 2021 and they have failed spectacularly. Instead of crying about valuation, bears just have to accept they were wrong on TSLA and move on. Being unable to admit that as an investor is a bad sign - means you're investing with emotions and pride rather than pure logic.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:37:16'] Sadly, I think comparing valuation to other auto manufacturers and backing-up absurd multiples misses the bigger point. $100Bn gain on a $400MM contract... this has always been the mom and dad of meme stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 05:54:33'] Appreciate the attempt to put some numbers behind their valuation. Lots of assumptions here of course. One in particular I’m curious about. Do you assume outstanding shares remain constant? If so, that is a big leap given Tesla’s history of stock issuance and large need for capital to expand production. If a lot of stock is issued, your earning per share will drop, driving up P/E.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:26:10'] Your worst case scenario is no where near the worst case scenario. There could be a recession, recalls, factory delays and fluctuations in world currency. Tesla's valuation metrics are really poisoning the whole market right now (Cloudflare, Netflix etc) and tons of companies need a 40% haircut
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:11:23'] Why are you calling delivering 1,400,000 vehicles literally next year the worst case scenario? Worst case scenario would be say Giga Berlin gets delayed and not producing for another year or 2. Or even Giga Austin also gets delayed as well. Also running into issues with China is also always a possibility. You also have a “worst case” P/E in 2024 of 48 for over a 1 trillion dollar company doing 138 billion dollars in revenue and this is assuming they are still producing high numbers. I get it at the end of the day investing is all about speculation but when I invest or put money towards something I really want to make sure my money is safe by absolutely assuming worst case scenario because at the end of the day nothing ever goes as planned and life and stuff happens. For example one of my favorite stocks is NEE. I was in the $60-$68 range. A lot of people were buying this stick in the hopes of a government deal in congress. When that deal got delayed the stock sold off. The questions I asked myself was what if the government deal didnt go through and they didnt get funding, what if they keep issuing shares(which your analysis didnt mention even though share dilution is a huge part that people rarely pay attention too), what if there are issues with their expansion as in they are delayed and they will be unable to expand production in the Midwest due to government issues or competition. The question is if all these things happen will I still be buying the stock? If the answer is no then I am not investing. Your worst case scenario seems to assume Elons or Wallstreets worst case scenario which is still really far up there. At the end of the day I like to make sure as much as possible that my money is secure by increasing my chances and decreasing my risk by assuming things on the worst side because life is unpredictable and you still assumed everything being in track in your worst case scenario. Overall I really cant take your analysis seriously and I know already that Tesla fanboys are going to come at me saying “your just mad you missed the boat”. Yeah your probably right but I would rather miss the boat then be on it when it starts to sink. This can happen due to Fed starting to taper which greatly effects high valued growth stocks or fundamentals coming back to play which it always has in the past but nobody knows when. One of the greatest if not the greatest investor ever Warren Buffet once said “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked”.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 14:17:17'] I find it funny that people are so Bullish/Bearish on TSLA, and trying to justify their position using numbers. For god's sake, bitcoin has a market cap of 1.16 Trillion dollars, a currency that does no more than 7 transaction per second, and has literary no backing or actual value. The market stopped making sense a long time ago. TSLA and BTC are valued as such for the same reasons. And if one falls the other will.  Better just stand and watch from the sideline.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:47:17'] Margins are the hardest metrics to improve for a company. The Industry standard is around 6% with some companies around 9%. When Tesla is already operating at such efficient margins relative to the industry, how can you justify the improvement? We know that margins are generally lagged and with inflation of raw materials growing faster than car prices (relatively elastic good), shouldn't we see Q3's performance as an outlier and expect partial regression back to the standard over time instead of improvement?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:08:30'] This post, like most posts about Tesla is comparing the trend set for the last years of a company being the leader in EV technology, they still are, but the other companies are getting better and the lead of Tesla is shrinking. The Automobile sales are mostly „emotional sales“ and Tesla is not as popular in Europe and China as it is in the USA. It must be noted that these markets are bigger than the US market and will have a larger impact on future sales growth. A look at the future P/E ratios show that 2024 ratios would be justified if the share price will remain where it is.Investing in a company that will be priced the same in 2 years is not what most Tesla investors are having in mind IMO.Still Tesla has a great future, if it is as great as the current stock price predicts or greater, that is a matter not only of Tesla, but also of the available products of their competitors and the sales they can generate. Buying an EV was much more a question to buy A Tesla or a combustion car in the past and more a question of which one to buy in the future. The valuations of other car manufacturers are not the same, because they are only making little of their revenue from the growing EV market and much more on the shrinking combustion engine market. With increasing EV sales this will change. If and at what point the EV sales will surpass the total Automobile sales worldwide is still in question, because having an automobile is not as desirable as it used to be and car sharing and public transportation is rising as well. ( my thoughts on Tesla and the limits to the growing EV market is bullish, but not as bullish as the market is)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:49:08'] 1.4m deliveries as the worst case is wrong. You are ignoring the fact that Berlin might never open. They blitzed the permitting process. There’s a possibility (I don’t know how large) that they will have to tear down their factory in Berlin.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:01:18'] Assuming the p/s ratio of a mature car company, in this case stellantis, 0.62, Tesla would have to eventually generate 1.6 trillion in sales (in 2020 prices) which is about 44% of the global automotive market for them to be valued fairly. I think that's  unlikely. This is also why you can't extrapolate trends forever for this company. It's valuation is so big you have to think in terms of how big they could possibly get.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:29:42'] Tesla sells under 1% of all vehicles globally but is supposedly more valuable than all other automakers combined. Tesla is *insanely* overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:46:26'] Tesla gets lots of doubt, and it's rightfully so because growth is hard! There are so many things that can get in the way of growth. The thing people don't realize is Tesla is still in hardcore growth mode. The analysis done by the OP was purposefully simplified but had an ending that could imply once Berlin and Austin are done that Tesla will peak. I think Tesla in a a few short years will still be growing with more and larger factories.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 10:33:17'] Objectively speaking, once the Giga Berlin and Giga Austin up and running, Tesla will look for new location for their next Giga factory. They have more than enough cash to get another one.Word on the street say that their next location might be India, Indonesia or maybe Australia. We don’t know what is the maximum output capacity of each Tesla factories and if we use Herbert Diess analogy of 10 hours for a model 3 per assembly line (during covid season and supply chain constraint) then it is a scary estimation on how much Tesla output will be if they have all the raw materials and chips available for the full on no constraint operation. Right now a model 3 lead time is at the end of 2022 (supply chain issue finally caught up to them). Imagine when there’s no constraint and you can order a Tesla and get delivery notice literally in a few weeks to a month. If Hertz 100K order is green (down payment was paid) then I can see how Tesla will need another Giga factory soon.In addition, SpaceX is also part of Tesla and they will send another crew of 4 NASA astronauts to the ISS by Halloween (they charged NASA 50 mil per round trip seat I believed) not to mention countless supply transport to the ISS as well as satellite launches for the US government which did not come cheap. SpaceX reusable rockets and boosters allow them to just printing money as their OpCost is minimum. Etc.Do they deserve a trillion dollar company? Yes if they execute it right and keep sticking to the dirty politic play by the US government and their UAW. GM and Ford would rather play politics than actual try to play catch up and if Elon manage to poach Diess to their side, I can see their share hit 2000s range soon. Else they will hover around 1000-1100 until they hit their next milestone.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:05:30'] don't other car company have a pe of 10?  maybe that's the fair value.  and tesla will need quite a while to reach.  I think tesla can reach 10 mil sales no problem but that hugely depend how fast electrification of car happens globally.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:12:37'] Lol not a cult
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 05:53:28'] The only real problem with their valuation is, that everyone thinks that Tesla can just increase their sales numbers without problems. Growth right now looks good as they are opening further factories, but these cars needs to get sold first. And somehow I doubt it that they can constantly increase that number by 600k annual, especially with the upcoming competition.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:47:19'] The future is clear - there are no combustion engine cars. If you believe that early move gives a huge advantage you can justify the valuation of $TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:33:50'] I get trying to add some sense into their evaluation but I have not been convinced with this analysis.  You should compare them to other companies in and out of the industry to show correlation. My biggest pain when talking about Tesla stock is everyone says they aren’t a car company, they’re a tech company.  I get where they are coming from but what do they sell? Cars.  So they are an automotive company.  Until they franchise out their tech they are just a car company and their quality control is terrible at that. Quickly comparing numbers for Tesla, sales volume in cars last year was 500k which is just a small fraction compared to other companies (1/4 for Toyota, 1/5 for Ford) in the US and others sell more outside the US.   Personally I don’t believe they have the sales to make their evaluation something that will last.  I know theirs more to it but I’m not writing a post about the financials right now. It’s a fad stock, the first one in awhile since Apple, but it’s a fad stock that doesn’t equate to the performance of what Apple was able to achieve.  You’d have to compare it to maybe Facebook in regards to fad stocks and even then I think Facebook isn’t as overly invested in as Tesla is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:10:58'] Also don’t take into account their FSD feature which many other companies might subcontract off them or they can convert to SaaS
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:16:06'] Thank you for the analysis. In addition to auto sales there is are three or four other major factors that likely boost valuation.  \- Autonomy - If they can achieve self-driving they have optionality for robo-taxis, uber and delivery markets.  \- Energy - The solar and storage markets are growing quickly.  \- Trucking - Still hasn't officially launched but this is another sector to disrupt.  Both the Semi and the Cybertruck. \- Robotics - Probably a 10 year bet but they have aspirations to go well beyond cars. Each of these is likely a 2X multiplier.  Even if you hedge on one, two, or even three of these, there is a good probability that one of these big-bets will hit and get you to numbers that fully justify the valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 12:08:57'] TSLA has experienced extraordinary growth over the last two years, but what I find remarkable about them is their fundamentals actually look cheaper now than they did before the start of the bull run. Let's imagine TSLA was producing the same earnings and sales but at a January 2020 valuation.TSLA | Current Price | Jan 2020 Price|-|-|-||Market Cap|$1073B|$87B||P/E|361|25||Forward P/E|143.4|11.6||PEG|4.95|0.40||P/S|22.9|1.86||P/B|43.6|3.5|TSLA was around an $87B company at the start of 2020. I look at these numbers and think, despite the popular sentiment at the time, that TSLA was an absolute bargain at its 2020 prices. Despite what most people would've told you at the time, their price back then was absurdly low. TSLA's projected 5-year EPS growth is actually higher now (73% per year) than it was at the start of 2020 (around 50%). To me the lesson is if you think the market has fundamentally mispriced something, have some humility and consider the market may know something you don't.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:09:55'] Excellent post! Numbers don't lie. There is also a bunch of analysts who claim that competition will catch up soon. But no one has the manufacturing technology close to the like of Gigafactories that can produce cars with 30% profit margin, x3-5 times faster. No one is churning out their own batteries and other car parts. Tesla isn't just producing cars. They've disrupted the entire car manufacturing process.  "Prototype is easy. Production is hard."
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 13:01:20'] Nice write up.  Just want to point out people have been saying TSLA has been over valued for the past decade.  A small investment 10 years ago would have made any of us wealthy.  TSLA defies all conventional logic.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 05:18:36'] Here’s what I see. Tesla’s profit margin per car is approx 30%; other car mfgs have profit margins that are 10-15%. Teslas waiting list is almost a year long at this point. There is more demand for their cars than can be made. The number of cars that they produce will double after Texas and Berlin come online. Tesla’s multiple will be at 6x after these plants come online which is in line w other high growth industries like software. Other existing plants are also being expanded. Tesla could use all of the money it’s gotten from shareholders to build more plants than are currently known or accounted for. Hertz is a game changer and other car rental businesses will have to follow suit or go bankrupt. Any company that uses a fleet of vehicles has to seriously consider why it’s not transitioning over to Tesla. The last time Tesla hit $1500 they split the stock. They’re just $250 away from that price. The full power of Tesla’s AI hasn’t even hit full stride yet. They built their own chips for this and nobody else is even close. The AI will have applications beyond just cars. Industry titans like GM and Volkswagen are dead men walking and they know it. Their leadership have already admitted that they will need at least 5 years to catch up to where Tesla is now, assuming that Tesla stops innovating today. That is a ton of capacity and market share open for Tesla to take over.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:06:17'] I find that the people who tend to dislike Tesla are individuals from these three groups:1. Upset they didn't invest in Tesla.2. Dislike Musk.3. Don't really understand the direction of this company or the numbers behind it.You have some saying 1.4 million deliveries is unrealistic for y2022 and says you're being way too optimistic. If that individual did any research, they would know that y2020, Tesla did 500,000 vehicle deliveries. This year, they are projected to do 900,000 to 970,000 vehicles. That's nearly a 100% increase. 1.4 million is definitely possible next year if the timeline for the factories is operating as intended and if Tesla can manage the chip supply chain better than expected. But I don't think this individual even knows about the new factories being operational soon.What people aren't realizing is that Tesla is the most vertically integrated automanufacturer in the world. Being less dependent on other suppliers significantly increases their supply chain processing and leads to higher margins which at this point, I believe is the most profitable mass selling vehicle in the market. Definitely for EV's. Very few were creating supplies for EV vehicles so Tesla took it upon themselves to develop it on their own so they can properly control their production the best way possible. These other legacy manufacturers are lagging behind severely.You have another showing numbers from Europe EV sales without realizing that Tesla has yet to even crack the European market because legitimately, EVERY vehicle Tesla produces is sold and because of huge demand in areas where they produce the vehicles, they can't get any to Europe without it being sold already intra-country.What OP hasn't even mentioned in detail are Tesla's other projects. If they weren't working extensively on these other projects and strictly focused on pushing out as many vehicles as possible, they would be crushing the profit. Their software is going to take some time to pay dividends but it will get to the point where you will buy a Tesla not just because of the performance but because the software is significantly ahead of their competitors.Let's also talk about the fact that new Tesla vehicles sold in America currently do not receive any federal tax credit and hasn't for many years. Yet vehicles are consistently flying off the shelves.Another thing is Tesla's 'Model 2' which is designed to introduce an even more affordable mass-market EV in the likes that no other EV company will come close to replicating for the foreseeable future. Couple this Model 2, projected to be under $25,000 with federal and state subsidies, it will be stupid not to buy a Model 2 if you want the best performance for the best buck, dollar-for-dollar.I'm loving the direction Tesla is going. Constantly innovating while other EV manufacturers are behind. Some want to go fully EV by 2035. We all know why they won't go fully EV now... because they don't have the expertise, capacity, and capabilities to transition from ICE to EV without ruining their sales. I doubt they are making any profits on their EV's which is why GM doesn't even report EV numbers data separately as it would cause investors to pressure GM on their EV initiative.I'm not selling any of my shares for the next 5-6 years. If people think Tesla is a fad and that other companies are 'catching up', they don't understand the business. If they think Tesla is sitting idle and would just allow other companies to catch up when Musk is arguably the most innovative individual in the corporate business world we've seen in the last half-century, they are mistaken. This company constantly works on creating innovative technology and products. By the time those legacy manufacturers think they caught up, they are years behind what Tesla has planned already.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:40:20'] I want to start by saying WAS a major tesla investor, I now only hold 1 share (for sentimental reasons). One thing that was always in the back of my mind as I accumulated my shares from 2014 thru many ups and downs, is that most only consider the automotive side of Tesla in its potential future growth. My belief in Tesla thru a number of years was that the commercial powerwall would eventually surpass the automotive side, all that said I hit all of my sell targets well before that ever happened so I wouldn't consider it a buy currently.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:22:42'] I think I am betting on Tesla's future sustained operations and growth via the LIT etf. I think lithium is to oil; as Electric vehicles are to Gas Vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:38:17'] Tesla is this high because it’s being short squeezed to all hell. Back room handshake deals giving time for big players to exit the positions slowly. When it hits a top, there will be more shorting down, then inevitably more covering which shoots the price up. Numbers/market cap/revenue don’t matter in the market anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 10:15:59'] The last paragraph is the most important one in this post. You can make an argument that they could grow into their current valuation based on just cars but that’s not really an investment opportunity. The goal should be to make money, not just hopefully tread water. FSD and to a lesser extent(for now) energy make that possible. If they can reach autonomy with their vehicles, it will turn the whole auto industry on its head. It’s hard to describe how profound of an impact that would have on society. If they can’t figure out FSD, it’s just a high margin automaker. Nothing too special. As a beta tester, I’m pretty confident they will hit level 5 eventually. 10.2 to 10.3 was a pretty big jump. If 10.4 is the same or larger then I’ll probably move my timelines up. If not, I might trim my positions(maybe). I’m also curious to how it will handle snow/ice come winter.

So guess who's gonna wreck a lot of other big car companys who got too late into this game... AD is gonna be the megatrillion business. Big companys will fall and in 15 years nothing but cheap ugly cars will be driving on the road which you can order via a Tesla-app.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:18:46'] You can run a valuation analysis on the majority of the companies (specifically those in "tech") and come to the same conclusion. Unless you are buying for a dividend, you are really only stock in the hopes that in x time it will be worth more than the price you paid. Valuations only matter when purchasing ownership in a company (imo) and lets be honest, no one here has that kind of buying power. Stocks at their core, unless being purchased for controlling ownership, are one big ponzy scheme. Pullback all the bs smoke and mirrors, legal ponzy schemes at their core.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 08:33:37'] From my point of view, the strongest factor for Tesla's success is their ability to MANAGE ENERGY.1. Their cars are popular because they not only look good and perform well but have a longer range than most other electric cars.2. Solar roof and Powerwall *can* supply a more convenient solar experience for homeowners.3. Megapack has saved many cities/states/countries millions of dollars preventing/supplementing power outages.4. All of this is facilitated by cutting edge battery tech being developed in-house.5. Other point - Tesla is trying to revolutionize the manufacturing process by creating the machines that build the machines.I've been holding TSLA for 5+ years and there is definitely hype and overvaluation, but they are here to stay and their numbers just keep getting better. I will hold until I ABSOLUTELY NEED the money, which I hope is never.

They won't retain market share because of competition, and yes there will be harsh competition in EV. This is obvious.Tesla has two things that could justify this price:1) vertical integration (or whatever it's called). Basically what Amazon does, but with cars. So once you scale you start to produce your own parts (e.g. batteries) cutting out intermediaries. 2) Side businesses. Battery packs, solar roofs and this kind of stuff. Basically they expand their competences in other somewhat related fields. I wouldn't be surprised seeing them into domotic systems soon in the future. To all this you can add the subscription services for the car, which basically will be like "pay every month for updates and cool stuff, otherwise use the basic system which will suck the more your car age" (My personal prediction)So I believe these are all great things and there is a lot of potential. However I don't like the price from a risk perspective. Give me whatever performance prediction you want, 300 P/E is too much for me even under the most optimistic assumptions. I would honestly have problems at 100 P/E.This said, I hope they will succeed in everything (including that humanoid robot) and everyone holding it in their portfolio will make a shit ton of money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 08:06:13'] For me it's just that Elon's vision for the future of cars / driving really resonated with me. When I first started investing in $TSLA, it was in Elon more than anything. Now I own a Tesla and everybody who we have let drive it falls in love with it and wants one of their own. The implications of Full-Self-Driving are also amazing - especially for me as a blind person. I never gave a fuck about cars in my life, but I'm so into our Tesla despite not being able to drive it. I took great pains to make sure I could be listed as an owner despite being blind. I can take a more active role in its maintenance and everyday activities, and they get better with every update.I get that Tesla hasn't sold as many cars as Ford or other car companies, but Nokia was once selling more phones than iPhone, too.Oh, and from a stock perspective I also like that Elon is aware of the shorts and will actively try to bust them when possible.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 03:43:42'] Do math. It's easy. Production x 50k per car. (probably more thanks to falling dollar, ie inflation) Or use profit per factory. Never use pe ratio on a rapid growth company. Use price to sales ratio similar to other growth companies. Factories. It's about the machine that builds the machine. GM, VW, Ford can't compete with Teslas output efficiency. Anyway focus just on Profit per Factory. Tesla made 1.5 Billion net profit last Q with 2 factories while building 2 factories wtf. With 4 Factories = 4B minimum per Quarter(1 Billion per F per Q). So thats 16 Billion per year Net profit just on cars. Play with this number. Now add FSD, solar, charging network and Mega pack sales. I see 50 percent improvement in profit per factory once completed. 6B X 4F =24B/yr Net Profit on cars only! So multiply 24B x future PE ratio. Amzn has a pe ratio of over 100. If you take just 80 PE x 24 Billion =1.92 TRILLION. Tesla can build a new factory with 1.5 Billion. They made this in less than a year off Bitcoin investment. Tesla has reach escape velocity.

(not counting on robotoaxi, BTW).Dark horse: Tesla Bot = global workforce(!)\- They have 3 product they haven't even started shipping but already reservations out the wazoo (last I checked well over a million reservations for Cybertruck alone)\- They are in the top 2 places the best and the brightest want to work at (the other being SpaceX), which gives them a good chance that they will keep out-innovating others in the future.Tesla has always stated that long term they want to be an energy company. 6 of the top 20 companies (by revenue) are energy related. Many of them fossil fuel related. Someone is going to eat their lunch big time. Tesla seems well positioned to be part of that feeding frenzy....Oh, and the CEO cares about the product (and actually understands it). This is something not found in ANY other big company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 03:54:46'] I think what most people don’t understand is that Tesla makes more money when they sell a Tesla on average than when Ford sells a Ford.Compare # of Tesla’s sold Vs # of Ford’s sold in Q3 2021.Then ask yourself why is Tesla making the same net income as Ford when they sell almost 10x the amount of cars.Then ask yourself what will Tesla be earning when they sell the same amount of cars as Ford.You can back Tesla share price with pretty simple numbers?2025 if we say Tesla produces:5.2 million cars @ $48k average sell price.Assume 30% gross margin.Operating margin 20%.You get to an EPS around $40 assign it less than PE as Amazon now.50 * 40 = 2000. Discount that back today.Get to around $1200-1400 share today.203015 million cars @$48k ASP.Assume 30% gross margin.24% operating margin.EPS at $120 * 30 = $3600
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 06:13:56'] They convince themselves it’s more than a car company and while there not completely wrong they way over blow the other parts of the business to justify their fomo. It’s a classic case of it went up so I’m right. I could very well end up being wrong but the odds are not in their favor at the current evaluation. Just look at one of the comments above. Someone writes car+ data=advantage in insurance. Cool story but think about it deeper it would take them decades to get licensed  to be insured in every state. It’s not likely to happen but ppl just bake it in when these things are much more complex than they make it out to be.The company is going to be very successful IMO but to much hopium baked in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 04:07:53'] From a PE perspective, Tesla earnings have been growing exponentially, and they've raised car prices 10%+ in the last few months with no impact on sales so far.  currently at 334 should drop to under 100 with the next two factories alone.\- FSD if they can achieve level 5 before competitors could be worth more than a trillion market cap, many applications possible, robo taxi, over night travel, shipping etc.\- Energy: this also could be bigger than tesla auto, the super charger network will be opening up to all EVs soon which will allow tesla to resell power a very high profits around the world.  And then of course there is the energy grid business with solar and battery packs that is in its baby phase.  someday when the cars battery packs can last a million miles it will be used for energy storage/resell...storing solar and cheaper power from the grid late at night to resell at peak usage hours.As an auto company alone 1500-2000/sh is a bear case, if they hit on FSD or energy then the stock is dirt cheap right now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 09:21:56'] I think you also have to look at the long term holders of Tesla stock and how much they have to gain by holding.You talk about 10% in a week. But for those who bought at $100/share, that’s another 100% on their initial investment. I work with someone who bought five shares back in 2020 and he’s up $9000. He doesn’t plan to sell for years. Also, options premiums are *ridiculous* for Tesla. If you can afford 100 shares, you could write 10% OTM calls 7 DTE calls and collect $3000 in premium. Imagine making $3000 a week. So why would you sell your shares if they’re not a consistent source of income. And how many people bought *thousands* of shares of Tesla last year. If you’re up 500-1000% and one CC can pay four months of your mortgage, why would you sell?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 09:23:52'] I think Tesla is currently way overvalued if you're looking at it purely from an EV point of view.   However, if you look at it from a big picture perspective it might make more sense.   I'm not just looking at Tesla, I'm looking at the whole family of companies run by Musk and what their ultimate goal(s) may be.   If you wanted to build a base on the moon, mars or say, [a giant metallic asteroid](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/16-psyche/in-depth/) that could potentially put every gold mine on earth out of business - what all would you need to do it?   Spacex, Boring Company, Tesla, and Starlink would be a good start.   All these seemingly random business ventures make more sense to me when looked at from that perspective.

I think I heard that he might let tesla stock owners invest the same amount into starlink pre IPO. The last 2 days I have been contamplating whether I should invest into tesla purely for the possebility of being able to invest into starlink pre IPO.The absolute worst outcome is that I loose 50% of my investment which could be a "worth it" expence if I was then able to invest into starlink pre IPO.If this IPO thing dosen't happen It still might be worth it to be safe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 09:42:13'] the fact you think 10% a day is a big deal just shows the different in your mentality vs new investors. Im a relatively new investor and i regularly see 20% down days and 50% up days with options trading or crypto or smaller stocks. I think thats what Tesla is tapping into that except its the largest. Think of it this way tesla is the OG meme stock before amd and gme and amc, WSB was talking about tesla options and gains.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 09:46:31'] Tesla is an expensive stock, but the fundamentals of the EV market are absolutely phenomenal and Tesla is the clear lead in the market.  No one else is even close and none of the legacy auto companies will be able to close the gap for at least 5 years, except maybe VW which might be only 3-4 years behind.  So EVs are going to go mass adoption before the legacy auto companies have a chance to catch up, and if that happens it’ll be Tesla with 20-25% market share, a bunch of Chinese companies with another 50%, VW with maybe 10%, and everyone else fighting over the scraps.  If Tesla can take 20% of the entire Auto market (including 80% of the luxury market), the current market cap can be justified.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:01:54'] Clearly overvalued but since when has that stopped a stock?People hate the idea but charisma matters and elon is so much better at it than any other car company (maybe any other company of any kind?). He motivates peoples and energises them and maybe that's enough to push tesla forward. It's also a new company and not weighed down in the same way as other car manufacturers. One view you could take is that money is ultimately a way to allocate resources to things people want to support. You could view teslas valuation not from a logical financial perspective but as a reflection of how much at least some of the world's population wants to see it continue doing what it's doing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:28:00'] 30% margin on vehicles, have a foot in not just the auto industry, but the software and hardware industry, Energy, which could lead to nearly a trillion dollar valuation in a few years time on its own, battery manufacturing mining, processing and recycling, Engineering of all parts from alloys to glass to to the cars heat pumps in house In lab will give them a leg over all other manufacturers so long as they never plan to do those things themselves. Other automakers best bet is that a third party company solves the mystery of solid state glass battery’s and sells it to all company’s equally. This would make EVs super cheap, and destroy Tesla’s lead in battery technology and solid state would not need the special thermal management Tesla has devised and would not require the incredible efficiency Tesla’s have. But again they’re not just an auto maker. It’s believed that if they license out their auto pilot software with subscription to all manufacturers they could become a realistic trillion dollar company overnight. If their energy sector succeeds as well as it should and replace the gas giants it should potentially take on their valuations. If their AI works out and they are truly able to replace the factory worker entirely within 15 years they will be worth a ridiculous amount of money. They could potentially replace 60-70% of manufacturing jobs with robots. Currently that would be about 9 million robots for specifically manufacturing jobs. 100,000 dollars per bot* 9mill…. = 900 billion dollars of sales. That ignores a lot of jobs and a lot of potential. People don’t invest in Tesla for 2 years from now. I’m invested in Tesla because I see a dystopian future where Tesla=skynet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:28:08'] Read the book “Elon Musk” by Ashlee Vance. Covers a lot of early Tesla history in a pretty unbiased fashion. Anyone like Musk who can survive what he went through in both 2008 and again in 2018 / 2019 is basically a hardcore motherfucker. A CEO like Elon is a once in a generation, maybe even once in a multi-generation personality. As long as Elon is on board, Tesla will continue to drag the entire industry forward with it. That book basically proves it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:33:12'] People are confident in Elon Musk that s why
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:56:32'] Elon said manufacturing expertise was their mea culpa and he's been right so far.Insane ability to scale. We struggled with 1k model 3's for about a year and a half. The building of factories has gotten faster and more efficient. The production is more efficient. All of these efficiencies are leading towards margins increases and cost declines. The objective has always been an overall 50% decrease in costs with 25% from the battery and 25 % from manufacturing the remaining 50% of raw materials can't be helped. Tesla is making an EV 3 times as fast as VW 30 hours vs 10. That should only get relatively worse as Tesla spams automation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 11:05:46'] I've been thinking about it for a long time and came up with a term:Intelligent by association.

All that time you’ve been “sitting on the sidelines” you could have just put in a week / weekends work researching the company and decided for yourself.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 14:03:57'] I mean, c’mon. Other car companies, every other car company, has had 100 years to get it right, and the Tesla Roadster is faster than any production car on the planet, and off the planet. But speed is only one element. It’s superior in every way. Even arguing there is a close competitor is just ridiculous. If Tesla can do that in a fraction of the time, it’s obvious. You can’t deny the accelerated increase in production. It’s doing what the entire industry (and other industries) said it could not do. Elon and the Tesla team are making the impossible possible, the unbelievable believable. No other company has been or is capable of that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 14:04:16'] There are so many reasons. 1. Tesla's mission is to "accelerate the transformation to sustainable energy".  Energy and auto are two of the largest markets, and can support multi-trillion valuations for an industry leader in both. The way the world is trending with climate change batteries are an extremely valuable commodity. They plan on becoming the largest battery producer within the decade. It's amazing their pilot line is one of the top 10 plants in the world.2. They years ahead of Western world auto competition due to continued innovation and starting with a blank slate. The charging network is incredibly valuable. Their vehicles provide an excellent consumer experience. Competitors can't catch up due to differences in talent, culture and organization.3. Tesla and SpaceX are the most sought employers for new engineers, they take the best and brightest. They are changing the world for the better and driving innovation, it's incredibly wholesome and people genuinely want to help provided a solution to climate change. This resource alone is a huge competitive advantage.4. Culture, it's okay to fail and take risks to make the product better, fear of failure is reduced which leads to better design. Their is a 'first principles' approach that creates better products. 5. Manufacturing will be their key long-term competitive advantage. Automation and building the machine that builds the machine, parts reduction and innovation driven by culture and talent makes the difference.  Giga castings, structural batteries are not easily replicable innovations and will improve gross margins to roughly 40%, way above competitors. Shanghai factory is the first iteration from their original factory and is very likely the most efficient and highest margin auto factory in the world. Berlin and Texas will have noticeable improvements over Shanghai.6. Tesla is only just starting to take off and ramp, they are the Apple of the 2020's. The ecosystem and abundance of high profit opportunities is underappreciated. FSD, subscriptions, in-car software, charging, charging locations retail and insurance. Insurance is a sleeper, that will disrupt the industry. They have such a massive moat with individual driver data they can obtain maybe 50% gross margin from insurance while still offering lower rates by attracting the safest drivers with their safety score. 7. Energy business will be bigger than auto, in the next year or two their megapack sales will 10x as they have 10x capacity coming online. They are backed up 1-2 years in orders and there is only more coming with more wind and solar going online every year. They recently were approved to be an energy operator in Texas, big money from energy arbitrage and auto-bidder is expected. 8. FSD will fundamentally change transportation. 9. Average selling prices are going up from massive demand and costs held, then will go down from 4680's and giga castings, factory iteration etc. This means more profit per car and also the number of cars produced is growing exponentially. 50% per unit growth for the decade is the goal. This year will be about 80-90%, Next year might be the same with two massive factories ramping. 10. Q4 earnings might double from Q3. The P/E is going to be under 100 in the next year or two while earnings are still going to growing crazy fast - 40% or greater per year, which easily justifies a high multiple. The sky is the limit, easy dcf calculations and reasonable projections value Tesla as a multi-trillion company in a few years.11. Elon, the visionary, inspiring genius physicist/engineer is charismatic and created the culture. He can imagine and create a future that people don't believe is possible, which creates immense value. 12. There are so many more but those are the key drivers. 13. Autonomous robots. This is huge, project dojo and chip design. Please check out Rob Maurer at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUNLyzzvWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUNLyzzvWU). The video is even a bit dated at this point but there are some really great youtubers with excellent insight who have solid track records.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 14:25:35'] Auto makers sell wholesale to dealers. Tesla sells retail to consumers. Automakers are assemblers and pay a margin to get the products on the line to be assembled. Tesla uses their own processes to build the core EV components. Legacy auto has unionized labor which will not want to switch from ICE to EV. Tesla has no legacy issues. Given the cost advantages for Tesla from scale in EV, margins on parts, margin on DTC vs dealers Tesla should always have a better car or a lower price as long as the above factors persist. Plus Tesla has upside to build out a utility business. Imagine the disaster if a legacy auto went to cut out their dealers?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 15:43:06'] I'm bullish because of their push on car production and profits recently. However it's 100% overvauled. US market does run in a bit of an over inflated bubble so there's that for one, and then I guess the hype has made it skyrocket. It did start a meme stock after all.So yeah, they finally look like a real car company now, and they're vertically integrating with their own battery factories, their own supply chains, their own in house tech. Their own team for self driving, which may work, may not. They've got that new battery that they're trying to mass produce, and if they can get it, will mean 600mile+ cars on a single charge.  All of that plus they have a brand like Apple, a cult like following, demand they can't keep up with, that alone might keep them relevant for a very long time.Disclaimer: I own 15 shares

So part of me thinks -- well he's done ONE impossible task, maybe he can tackle 2 to 3 more.* **He's Iron man**. I mean, if you could buy stocks in Stark Industries, would you care how much it costs?* **Tesla provides hope**. Stocks like Tesla, Moderna, and Intellia give me hope that there are super smart and dedicated people working on incredibly difficult problems for the benefit of mankind.

Musk has overcome all the possible obstacles he could - when people were shorting Tesla and saying the competition was soon to come or that it would never reach the scale that it has or that Tesla would fail as a company because the technology was not advanced enough, Musk eventually proved them wrong. Michael Burry, you know that guy who famously shorted the housing market when nobody else saw the housing crash of 2008. The guy who is seen as a prophet by many on this sub and won’t buy anything he’s shorting or short anything he’s buying… yeah that guy shorted Tesla only to watch as the stock nearly doubled in less than a year. Musk has defied all odds and continues to push the envelope. If you can’t get behind the fundamentals you can’t deny the story of the underdog winning and continuing to win.

Looking back just a few years, the bulls had it right all the time. It was obvious before too, but even more obvious now.Notice how Tesla pulls off one thing after the other, after these bears claimed it was impossible? Bear argument after bear argument falls.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 05:23:31'] In every bubble there are stocks like this that go way higher than they should. Very similar to .com bubble. Don't forget, Elon said Tesla was overpriced a year ago at 160.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 04:25:46'] Tesla is overpriced purely on the basis that EV sales growth is tied to investment in the necessary infrastructure to support that many electric vehicles in the first place, here in the UK with the amount of housing that doesn't have access to off-street parking that's a big problem, and with a distribution network that saw its last major overhaul in the late 1950s and the increasing use of renewables that are not as reliable as the energy sources they're replacing, I still don't think we can make the assumption that pure EV plays will be the future for next 50+ years. So I find the projected sales targets needed to justify Tesla's current valuation to be too optimistic, defo not outside the realms of possibility though.Hydrogen will probably be the energy source of haulage class vehicles, maybe a syngas variety of fuel for ICE and then pure electric for Arcimoto/E-Bike single occupancy commuters and luxury saloons. Developing parts of the world will defo not be ready for decades for any significant EV penetration and who knows where Tesla will be then.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 07:32:50'] They are the only software company with a decent car division. Traditional thinking would lead you to believe that competition would come from other car mfkts around the world,   but this will only happen if:  1. One of the large software houses (google, ms, apple) gets around to do FSD properly.  2. Decides to sell this technology to car mfkts instead of going at it on their own (like leaks have apple doing)  Homemade FSD from the likes of BMW,Mercedes etc is currently only a pipe-dream. The fact that google has spent the last 12 or so years trying to solve this, should tell you something about the complexity.  So their best bet atm is to stick with what they know (building cars) and hoping someone will sell them the software one day.  I think the more likely competition in the next 10 years time will come from one or more of the software giants (ms, google, apple)

In that time the likes of the legacy auto makers are in so much debt they can’t and will not catch Tesla tech. Tesla will role out Robbo taxi, insurance, solar, battery storage, AI and a $20k small car which will decrease in price as adoption takes on. Have a watch of ‘solving the money problem’ on YouTube, he sets out the next 9 years pretty well. I’m a TSLA holder and will add to my position every dip for the next 9 years regardless of stock price if they continue selling every car they produce and demand and innovation keeps up the same pace.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 02:38:30'] For starters, your friends do not move Tesla stock 10% in a single day. Reddit meme stock investors don’t move it either. It’s the big money, institutional investors that move every stock (GME & AMC exempt).So your question should be “What do institutional investors see in TESLA?” Why is it valued so ridiculously high?  My answer is I have no idea, but that sucker moves every day and is great for daytrading.

Somehow Tesla is valued at more than those three companies combined. So even if those three companies made no cars anymore and Tesla made 30 million a year it would be valued at more then those car manufacturers are worth right now. The only thing that justifies these extremely high expectations is a non-existing full self driving technology. Non-existing! Meanwhile there are companies that actually have this technology in the field. Prototypes to do much better than Tesla does at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 07:10:59'] I’ve got to agree with you that it’s mind boggling. Granted I’ve rode the Tesla wave a bit for some easy profits, but based on their capabilities and what they produce, I don’t understand how they have a valuation greater than one of the major automakers while making less than 1% of cars globally. Other companies seem to have been slow to adapt but I believe as they do their manufacturing capabilities could drink Tesla’s milkshake. A prime example is the Ford Mustang Mach E which was much more of a hit than Ford expected. There are also Lucid and Lordstown both gunning for the electric vehicle market. The 2022 Lucid Air is already a Motortrend Car of the Year finalist. Once the electric pick up truck segment hits prime time, I’m not sure Tesla will be able to match GM and Ford. Both companies are the go-to for work vehicles, have name recognition in the segment, loyal fan bases, an understanding of what people need capability wise, and existing relationships with purchasers. Don’t worry about the cyber truck hype, this market segment benefits from the full size truck chassis being highly customizable for particular fields.That being said I remember watching a video in math class around 1998, when we were learning about the stock market. One thing I remember from the video was how Amazon couldn’t meet their valuation at the time even if they were the seller of every book sold in the world at that time. Now look at how that turned out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 08:52:05'] Because the modern world is moving more and more toward clean energy mandates and away from fossil fuels, and Tesla is the only company in the EV space to be as far along and with as much brand recognition by several years at least. GM, Ford, Toyota are all scrambling to get their programs started while Tesla is already approaching 1,000,000 vehicles sold and delivered within a year. Their supply chain seems to be strong and they are not suffering from semiconductor or basic raw element shortages, and their battery technology and production is unrivaled, leaving many to believe they will not only be selling their own cars but selling batteries to other vehicle manufacturers who seek to compete with them. Lastly, they already have an established supercharger network that is continuing to grow. The high valuation is based on future earnings for a company that is so far ahead of any other competitor in an industry that is just beginning to boom.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:08:57'] Tesla is valued because of its revolutionary ideas. Not because it sells cars. It's going to change the way we use energy. As big as it is, most people think it's just getting started. When people say they bought a new civic, they say they bought a new car.When people say they bought a new model S, they say they bought a new tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 10:13:54'] People understand Tesla as a car company and judge them for that for those people that think they’re currently over valued. The real reason they’re at their valuation right now is multiple reasons:       Cars, they’re currently making 30% gross margins on their cars which is unheard of and continuing to increase this margin. They do everything in house which helps control their cost and are revolutionizing how to build a car with one example being making a car with the worlds largest cast machine, building their own batteries etc.      software: just like Apple they control their own software and whenever they sell a car they can sell software that increases revenue. Even when it’s sold as a used car in the future. They can continue to increase media and autopilot features and make subscriptions that become a huge revenue. Think about how big Netflix is off of $15 a month, now add in Tesla with their $10 a month subscription plan for internet, and $200 a month for full self driving. Their ability to charge money to unlock acceleration boost, heated seats etc.         solar: not only are they selling solar to residential, they’re just starting to put their foot in the door for commercial and be their own power plant for cities, this just started in Texas and will only keep expanding. Every time they install solar on a home they can have that customer opt into their micro grid power plant allowing them to use that energy to sell to the neighbors around them allowing them to have a larger play as a power plant company.        Robo-taxi: When they unlock this it will be a 30 trillion or more annual product, and this isn’t even factored into their stock today.        Semi truck: When they start building this it will save companies insurmountable amounts of money on the gas they would save alone in the first year ( most semi truck drivers spend 120k on gas a year, this semi will have free charging and cost 150k making it pay for itself within a year meaning every big company will be buying them up in hordes).        Superchargers: Think of these as gas stations across the country and they own and control the cost for every single one of these. Eventually when all of these have solar built on them which is what they’re doing they can give you electricity back in your car for a net positive with the cost for Tesla only being to install the charging station, after that the cost is essentially free for them.          AI: Watch their AI day: they’re working on some of the best AI in the world and will be a huge player. This will allow them to build more products like a humanoid robot which has even more potential to be huge, again this isn’t even factored into their value yet.           There’s so much more reasons why it is just not a car company, but do some research, it’s amazing and they’re just getting started.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 05:53:11'] Regarding, Buffet's investing philosophies, just because Buffett himself is against Tesla that doesn't mean if you invest in Tesla you are going against his philosophies.Buffett himself has stated many times that technology stocks are beyond him and he doesn't invest in things he cannot understand. So rather than looking at what stocks Buffet likes or doesn't like, you should be concerned with what his mindsets are.During his early years, he was very much a risk taker, he researched his plays and went almost all in on his high conviction plays. If one were to do their research properly, and are convinced that a stock is a play, that is very much something Buffett would do.With regards to their moat, it is simple, they are the best at what they do, and their only competition is themselves. The only one that can make a more profitable EV than Tesla is Tesla, each day they are outdoing themselves. Gigapress die-casting, 4680 batteries, FSD updates... the list goes on. Volume production of EV cars is an exceedingly difficult thing to do that no car manufacturers except for Tesla has cracked. Volume production of EVs is not the same as volume production of ICE cars, "competition is coming", I will only believe it when I see it. ICE manufacturers are currently struggling to keep volume production of EVs and they are still at negative/low margins.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 07:34:20'] As much I love the cars, I can’t afford it. I have the money but it would be so irresponsible of me to spend on this. Mortgage, kids college, saving for retirement. I could have been driving BMWs well before Tesla came about - came “this close” so many times and didn’t pull the trigger. Thank god. Did I miss the “ultimate driving experience”? Maybe. But I don’t care. Ppl with means will talk about “but you don’t have to pay for gas!”. Yes, true, but even with gas my Ford Edge comes out a few hundred cheaper per month and that’s before adding in the insurance. Then tack on teen drivers. Forget it.My point in this is that the TAM is huge and there’s more than enough to go around. The competition is coming and they’ll likely never be as good (although Rivian may, big may, give them a run for their money) but look at home many car companies we have today… many. They all fucked up and are years behind. But the F150 will sell, the Hummer will sell. The VM will sell. The Rivians are gorgeous and far more practical, and will sell. TSLA is a behemoth though. The FSD IP is probably worth billions alone, then comes solar power… they have a lot of room to grow. Not sure about multi-trillion though. Also, we had an internet bubble, a housing bubble, and now we have an EV bubble brewing. So many EV makers with very few deliveries are with many billions. Will bleed at some point. TSLA is golden long term though IMO

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-13 09:27:18'] Most investors have no idea what valuation or P/E ratio means for a stock price. Neither do I. I do know a lot about Tesla and I also "believe" in the company.  As a car company:1. They make the most compelling mass-market EV and have established brand loyalty. I fully anticipate every car will be EV or electric hybrid in the very near future. Even if you project that Tesla for 15% of the electric car market,  the move towards all electric bakes in incredible growth. 2. MARGINS MARGINS MARGINS. I personally love my Tesla but the lack of diversity in their options is disheartening. But this is on purpose. Their vertical integration and use of robots and AI as opposed to unions and supply chain allow them to price car at greater profit margin. They also eliminate car dealers. Tesla sells a more expensive new car and gets margins of 30% versus 10% of the mold of GM. Essentially they need to sell 1/3 number of vehicles to get similar ROI or stock valuation as other companies. 3. Charging infrastructure. One day, you will feel comfortable charging an EV anywhere. That is not today or tomorrow. The USA is not committed to this.  My best guess is that it will be 5 years or more.  As for right now,  Tesla is the only EV brand I feel safe driving around the USA with little fears on charging. That alone will keep the average consumer away from everything except tesla. This infrastructure has growth opportunities with subscription plans etc. Ask yourself, "how much is owning the monopoly of gas station of the future worth?"4. Auto insurance... yes tesla has their own. It is using AI to take data on driving behaviors so you can pay them lower insurance rates. 5. Solar energy... it's not profitable yet but it could be6. Future - Uber like ride hailing and car sharing service run by tesla app only on tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-11 10:08:21'] So maybe Tesla won’t go directly into Lithium mining, but regardless for those of us who want to profit over the likely increase in lithium demand and prices over the next 10 (or more) years, what’s the move? Buy stock of some top lithium companies and weight for the rise? Pump funds into a lithium ETF? You can’t buy lithium as a commodity like gold right? It just feels like Tech is the greatest investment of the future and much of tech relies on Lithium, an i renewable resource. Seems like the right time to buy in.

Good thing the entire market is going to continue to grow at a huge rate over the next decade or two.Second, it's pretty much like clockwork that multiple news organizations will report Tesla's month-to-month sales decline based on the first month of every quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 11:32:21'] I doubt that Tesla's market share will grow. Elon's plan was to kickstart the EV industry, so more car makers would make EVs. He succeeded.Don't think he wants 100% market share. He wants everyone in an EV, and he knows Tesla can't possibly supply them all.**I think an interesting question to ask is, "When EVs are the main cars being made, how will Tesla remain a leader?"**One big reason Tesla has done so well is that their focus was 100% on EVs. No legacy technology to consider. No legacy brands to drop. No legacy anything. Tesla was 100% focused. And that level of focus helps you compete against legacy players.**But at some point, perhaps within a decade if we're lucky, 51% of new cars will be EVs.**We'll be awash in choice. Even in 2022, there are so many more choices for EV buyers compared to three years ago. Things are moving fast.**Tesla will need to keep innovating faster than the competition.**It'll need to keep pushing forward. I doubt a legacy maker will leapfrog Tesla.If I was Elon, I'd be watching for new companies wanting to eat my lunch. If I was Elon, I might offer them part of my lunch, so we can partner up. Or so Tesla can buy them.As long as Tesla keeps innovating, they have a chance to remain the market leader.But if they get comfortable, some new kid's going to eat their lunch.**When Elon steps down in a few years...**...I'll be very curious who becomes the new CEO. Perhaps it'll be one of the people from a firm that gets bought out by Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 23:29:05'] Tremendous growth. The stock market is forward looking. It’s not based on the present or past. When companies report good earnings, the stock rises because that means faster than anticipated growth. Look at what Tesla did from 2019-2021 and look at what Ford did. Now imagine what the numbers would look like if both these companies continue this trend through 2025 and beyond.

Over 90% of their sales is ICE - and that's collapsing around their ears). Tesla is growing. Ford has an operating margin of 7%. Tesla has an operating margin of 19%. Ford is losing engineers in droves. Tesla gets the pick of the best and brightest. Ford has over 100bn in debt. Tesla has virtually none.Oh, and: Ford is a car company. Tesla is not. (I cannot fathom why people still don't get this)
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 01:48:37'] P/E is not relevant for a growth stock that is not near its projected "peak revenue"P/E is a relevant metric for mature businesses with lower, predictable growth expectations.Tesla is a company that has consistently demonstrated 50% CAGR on its revenues for quite some time. It is definitely going to continue this growth for the next 5 years with 4 GIGA factories, and beyond the next 5 years is anyone's guess.P/E for high growth companies like Tesla will always look inflated because investors are presently valuing the company based on its future expected income. When the market prices Tesla at 180x current earnings, it means that investors currently buying Tesla stock expect with high probability that the company will have a much higher level of earnings in the future, and are thus presently valuing the company based on their own expectations of what those future earnings will look like. The aggregate of these expectations has resulted into a 180x current earnings.Tesla will eventually "grow into" a mature P/E ratio like 20 or 30 by continually increasing its earnings quarter after quarter.

Tesla's stock price has been pushed up by speculators and trend-chasers. half the comments don't know what they're talking about. this type of thing has happened in the past. read up on the "growth trap" concept of prof. Jeremy Siegel. from The Future for Investors (2005):>The growth trap seduces investors into overpaying for the very firms and industries that drive innovation and spearhead economic expansion. This relentless pursuit of growth—through buying hot stocks, seeking exciting new technologies, or investing in the fastest-growing countries—dooms investors to poor returns. In fact, history shows that many of the best-performing investments are instead found in shrinking industries and in slower-growing countries.he goes on to compare IBM (trendy cutting edge tech) and Standard Oil (boring oil company) from the 1950s to 2000. >“Why did Standard Oil beat IBM when it fell far short in every growth category? One simple reason: valuation, the price you pay for the earnings and dividends you receive.>The price investors paid for IBM stock was just too high. Even though the computer giant trumped Standard Oil on growth, Standard Oil trumped IBM on valuation, and **valuation determines investor returns**.stocks that consistently trade over a p/e of about 50 nearly always go on to underperform the overall stock market. Tesla is practically guaranteed to be disappointing in the future.  typo edits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 05:10:26'] Your example shows exactly what happens when you just look at a PE or income figure without doing any actual research.You take Ford's net income from 2021 but forget to back out the one-time income from their Rivian stake ($8.2B). Without it, Ford has a net income of ~$9.7B. On top of that, Ford still needs to start ramping up their EV production, which will heavily reduce their profits to the point of being break-even or even cashflow negative like they were in 2019 and 2020.Tesla in the meanwhile increased their net income from $0.6B to $5.5B from 2020 to 2021. If you annualize their Q1 - which is historically always their least profitable quarter of the year - they're already on a $9.2B runrate (higher than what's expected from Ford). Most experts with a good track record on projecting Tesla expect them to do around the same in net income in Q2 and then significantly more in Q3 and Q4, and believe they might even have a shot at becoming the most profitable automaker on the planet this year at ~$20B. They also seem on a clear path towards becoming more profitable than all other automakers combined by 2024, especially with other OEMs declining significantly right now.On top of that, unlike almost every other automaker in the world, Tesla has no risk of bankruptcy thanks to their 0 debt and plenty of cash and positive cash flow.And then they're working on moonshots like robotaxis and Tesla Bot, which would instantly make them the most profitable company in the world if either of these worked out. Even if the market expects the chances of this happening are small, that's something that is taken into account for valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 05:50:37'] A way to think about this is to directly refer to the 'discounted stream of earnings/dividends' model. The value of a stock today is the sum ofearnings this year + earnings next year (lessened by some factor e.g. inflation, the usefulness to you, the range of alternative things to invest in) + earnings the year after (lessened even more). This sums to some value.Now if you are into growth stocks you believe that the rate of growth will a) be higher than that discount factor, so that each year's return is 'worth increasingly more' b) that it will stay higher than the discount factor for such a long time that you end up making a higher total profit than if you were getting 'jam today' rather than 'jam tomorrow'.The key point is that for a value stock, the main contributing terms in the equation of value lies on the left (this year, next year). For a growth stock, the bulk of it lies off to the right, e.g. the terms for years 10, 11, 12 or whatever.The problem is that forecasting a) how high growth will be b) how long it will lastThat's super difficult, and small errors in your estimates will absolutely wreck you with a growth stock. Less so with a value stock. Complicating things even more, the discount factor can change over time. We're seeing that right now, with 10y and 30y rates zooming up, inflation zooming up. If you forgot to include the chance of that happening into your equation, well, oops, you just fucked yourself, because suddenly everything on the right side of the equation is getting super-discounted.e.g. let's say you discounted by 3%. Year 1: 100% of earnings, year 2: 97% of earnings, ... year 10=74% earnings.now compare if rates jump to 7%: Year 1: 100% of earnings, years 2: 93% of earnings, years 10= 48%As you can see, the value stock, isn't really affected much by the rate change to 7%, so the share price doesn't move much. The numbers for year 1/2/3 are much the same.Whereas, the growth stock? Wow, the usefulness of earnings in year 10 just dropped by a third! But that's where the bulk of the useful earnings are happening. Therefore, the share price drops by a third as well.In reality, the people I've known who buy into growth stocks aren't using discounted views of the future, they're mostly buying into narratives, about the 'idea' of this company being much bigger very soon in the future. Humans find stories very persuasive.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 05:51:44'] Lot of stocks are get a huge boost from hype/popularity. For sure most people who contributed to its growth were not doing any technical analysis of its expected earnings for like 2040 or later like how some commenters claim
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 08:39:04'] It's really hard talking about Tesla because people will very quickly dogpile on with negativity even if they haven't looked at the company at all. It's one of those ones where everyone who is too smart to buy it is pretty bitter as they watch it soar and they are proven wrong over and over.Look at it this way, today on Yahoo finance Tesla's forward PE is 94.34[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics?p=TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics?p=TSLA)For a company that grew it's revenues by like 80% in the last year that's incredibly low. Remember Amazon's PE was over 3000 at one point.At the moment they're making 1 million cars a year, Elon wants to scale to 20 million cars a year and an equally large battery storage division. This means scaling to about 40x the size they are now, that's a vast amount of growth ahead, that's what people are buying into.Another thing to note is that Tesla is a very different company, their goal is to literally be mining raw materials and then selling cars direct to consumers and insuring and servicing them. This is very different from Ford who buy parts from suppliers and have to work with a dealership network which needs a big cut of sales.This is leaving out FSD and the Bot which, if they work, and it's a big if, have the potential to be insanely huge.Just do your own sums, look at Teslas earnings now and then work out what would happen in they scale the company 40x, that's where they plan to go, and it's not guaranteed they will make it, but that's what the bulls are pricing in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 08:47:36'] Simple: a lot of people are making bets that Tesla will grow into--and beyond--their current valuation.  Even though a lot of the growth/ profits already priced-in (like robo taxis, much larger share of the total car market) are still wildcards.Some of it is faith in Elon Musk.  Some of it is calculated speculation taking into account Tesla's rapid growth and profit margins.  I suspect most of it is FOMO.  I will say this: most companies do not get valued in this way.  Investors typically want to be rewarded for risk, and with so much of Tesla's future expected success already priced-in they are taking on risk without getting the level of reward that would normally be expected.  It's quite possible that Tesla will grow into and beyond their current valuation.  But right now a lot of that is uncompensated risk, which is not a good strategy for investors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 19:15:10'] Tesla makes more profits than GM and Ford now, with a fraction of the revenue. Not to say this justifies 1 trillion
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 03:55:06'] Many many big investors (including Bill Gates himself) didn't believe that Tesla would survive and entered massive short positions. Elon Musk has been talking about this for years now and very recently again in a Ted talk. (funny side story: Musk and Tesla have been sued for manipulating the market and notorious short sellers like Andrew a left are actually among the groups suing them).After it was clear that Tesla wasn't going under, the bets of those short sellers went very sour. In combination with som corporate actions of Tesla (stock splits in different forms), the short sellers were forced to buy back shares in order to close out their short positions. This led to a very y big buy pressure in the stock, which had nothing to do with actual earnings of the company, only with short sellers' needs to close their bad bets.Of course, some people on the long side of the market were very aware of that and joined the buying because they knew shorts were trapped. Remember the red "short shorts" that were available to buy in the Tesla webshop? This was some major trolling of Tesla with regard to short sellers losing their bets on Tesla going out of business.

They see "disruptive" and think they're going to be on the cover of the WSJ for believing it's The Way.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars  a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. Its the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).\n\nThe company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 10:48:35'] Tesla is ramping up, navigating around chip shortages, about to start production in 2 brand new factories and the gross margins on each car is a leader in the industry and Tesla is still growing. This latest quarter saw a 73% YoY growth.It's been reported that VW's Brandstätter and Diess are getting very worried. From the source below:>Diess stated that compared to Tesla and Chinese manufacturers VW is too expensive, slow and with low productivity not competitive>Now it is a matter of taking up the "fight against Grünheide" Diess said according to BI sources>If everything remains as it is, Diess insists, VW will no longer be competitive >Brandstätter stated>'It is urgently necessary that a new course is set in Wolfsburg. Future competition with Tesla's new Gigafactory will be brutal. The electric car pioneer sets new standards in car production. For example, a Model 3 is built in 10 hours, more than 3 times as fast as a VW ID.3 in Zwickau. This puts Tesla in another dimension in terms of productivity and profitability'>The VW Group CEO concluded>"That's why we have to take up the fight, attack and not let Grünheide ruin our location">This is a really alarming and crisis atmosphere at VW HQ and the tone the CEOs used sounds very different from Herbert Diess' tweet todayhttps://twitter.com/alex_avoigt/status/1443993103329857549?s=20

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 08:10:40'] There will be winners and losers in the EV segment. There are oodles of companies that won’t survive. Tesla isn’t one of them. They are at least and probably 10 years ahead of rivals. Keep in mind, it’s not just their cars, or their battery tech that makes them valuable. They also own the largest and fastest charging infrastructure out there. They spent 2009-2019 building up the supercharger infrastructure at a cost of billions and billions of dollars. It’s a unique advantage. I won’t even get into their factory building technology. Who else can build a giga-factory soup to nuts in a year. They have quality and design issues compared to Porsche but that’s an execution issue. No one else has the portfolio of tech that they do which is why they are worth what they are worth. Keep in mind the single handedly altered the trajectory of this segment of industry. Now everyone is jumping on board.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 12:43:26'] Where are all the Tesla haters I normally see in this sub? What other auto manufacturer can share growth like this? Tesla hasn't even peaked yet. The $25,000 model will be the end all once it enters production. Tesla will build at least two more giga factories over the next five year cementing their place in the auto, technology, AND energy sector. The battery packs being bought on several continents that will power cities is only getting started. IF Tesla continues this roll they will eat everyone's damn lunch. 1.2 million cybertruck reservations on top of all this adds multiple billions in revenue even if they only make a quarter of those reservations. It's insane what this group of people are accomplishing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 18:36:52'] Guy I worked with bought RIVN at IPO and it shot up 20%.Tried explaining that it wasn’t a good idea. Showed him balance sheet info like negative EPS and things of that nature. Tried to convince him, but he would always say, “well, it’s making me money, so I don’t see how that will stop.”He used to come into my office and brag about how he was up 5% for the day over a series of weeks. Then, it happened. People started realizing it was WAY over valued and the price started dropping like a rock. I mean, holy shit, they weren’t even making cars at this time. He stopped coming in to the office to brag. They’re sitting at about $17 now. He bought in at $130 because his brother in law “was good at this stuff and said it was a sure thing.”I check it every once in a while and think about him. I hope he sold that shit.

They were either ignorant or in denial about the massively negative FCF.When the CEO went out and said Intel was committed to paying a "competitive" dividend last month, that should have been the final warning.And yet, people were still surprised when the cut happened.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 00:20:12'] Netflix announced they would split the company into their DVD rentals and streaming in the summer of 2011. The stock dropped like a rock.  They realized that decision was a bad idea and then basically said, resume as we were. Fundamentally nothing changed about the company other than a shitty announcement.  I was in college at the time but everyone had Netflix.  2008-2009 it was almost non existent for most but by 2011 it was HUGE amongst the college population. My reasoning was simply, if everyone we know has it/uses it and the stock just dropped 75%, when is a better time to buy?I was in the investment club in college and really enjoyed the thought of day trading. I begged my parents for some money and they basically said I had to hold onto whatever I bought for at least 1 year rather than day trading.  Turned $5k into $20k by the time I graduated by sitting on NFLX.   Bought more and more of it once I had a full time job.  I’ve sold off some but I’m still sitting on $125k of Netflix with less than $25k invested. I’ve never felt more confidence about a stock / company in my life than following the summer of 2011.

It had crashed down all the way from over $110 or something. One of my buddies was a gaming analyst at a large investment bank, and he said it was way too oversold and the company was not going bankrupt, like investors were predicting. Also, I had just went to Macau and checked out their newest casino, and it was freaking packed. It was the largest casino in Macau at the time, and business was absolutely thriving. Should've been enough confirmation for me but I passed on investing.My buddy ended up investing $5K or $10K and did a 5X in a few months. LVS ended up going up to like $50 in a year or two... Yeh, I'm not sure if I would've held on for that long, but still sucks haha.

I got lots of downvotes because of saying negative things about ARKK. I even remember posts from people suggesting 40% in ARKK is “too conservative.” I of course said this is dumb, but in response I was told I was dumb and that ARKK was managed and can’t fail because she picks high quality companies with a big future. Those people are now down 60-80%.Edit: Hell. I even remember posts from people asking if 60% in ARK funds was diverse…and people said it was.There was one guy in early 2021 who was 70% in NIO. I said don’t do that, and I got downvoted. He’s down about 70-80% if he held. He thought NIO would become a $1T company like TSLA by 2025…so he still has a few years but good god.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 20:21:19'] When the Spectre and Meltdown mitigation attacks were first publicly revealed, the understanding at the time (from what I remember) was that these exploits weren't known to effect AMD CPUs; then it was revealed that Intel had been alerted to the potential exploits almost a year earlier. Combining these reveals with their continued inability to surmount the problems with their next node made them look (to me) like the semiconductor version of the "[this is fine](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine)" meme. Meanwhile, AMD was finally recovering from the well-intentioned, but disastrous "Bulldozer" architecture with its first "Zen" CPUs; their stock was sitting somewhere around $10. I tried to tell my dad (since I was just a poor college student) to immediately start buying as much AMD stock as possible.He never did.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:25:47'] Tesla, Nividia, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. Basically just all the hyped tech stocks.They all had (or were close to) Trillion dollar valuations which were either completely unsustainable or simply didn't allow any room for stock growth because they'd already 'priced in' the next 10 years.The whole point of investing in equities (and especially individual stocks) is to get a good return. How on earth did people think these companies could sustain their insane P/E ratios AND get other investors to buy in (i.e. get them a return) whilst they're on the way to doing it? At best, they'd be able to maintain the peak, but there no way they could just keep climbing. They were priced like startups.Their valuations were basically predicated on massive and unfettered growth. To justify them, *everything* was going to have to go right, which was just never going to happen.I was saying all this about 2 years ago and continuously downvoted for it and accused of 'timing the market'.

I decided to invest it in Tesla as I knew a lot about the company, Must, etc.I had no idea how to buy stocks and also I'm from Bulgaria, so things are not so easy as in the US (or eat least weren't back then). So I saw a banner ad on a website that said TRADE TESLA STOCK. I made an account and communicated with their support. It was some sort of futures only platform. You couldn't buy stocks - you could only bet on their movement and had to pay funding fee. The support, instead of telling me where to go buy stocks, told me that ain't happening in Bulgaria. So you guess what ... I still have the money in cash at home. Could have had it x20.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 20:54:34'] I am bearish on Nvidia and I admit defeat (did not short or trade options). It is a great company and I wish to own someday but I cannot wrap my head around its valuation. Nvidia has been always overvalued but with high interest rates environment, slowing growth and possible recession, I cannot digest its current valuation and volatility. Stock is currently priced in for near-perfect growth for the next 5 years.This stock can raise or drop %10 in one day after a catalysts or analyst rating. If anyone wants to buy Nvidia, he/she should look for very long term and stop focusing at valuation and daily movements.

Ron Wyden to tax unrealized capital gains, and held a Twitter poll on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla holding. When the Twitterati duly voted for him to dump shares in the electric-car maker, that confused the question of whether this is an insider signal about the share price.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Musk thinks that its insane that Tesla added $440 billion to its value in the past month alone, a risejust the rise, not the totalequivalent to the combined market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Toyota.\n\nTesla sits at the intersection of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them cou'

They are so set in their ways as far as how money works that they can't even begin to fathom how things like Tesla have taken off. It can't possibly be real in their minds, so they discredit and discount it. I assume similar things were said of oil companies and anyone putting their financial faith in internal combustion engines a century or so ago. Anyone with any sense of finance and how things work will eventually have to drop that pipe dream of wealth from slimy ground sludge, and clunky machines that will leave you in the wilderness to die, and come back to the tried and true horse and buggy.

The Audi etron?The Toyota Camry Electric?The FJ cruiser electric?Electric Jeep?The Ford F-150 lightning electric truck?Anyone who thinks Tesla is going to have any majority stake in market share a few years from now is out of their goddamn mind. They have a first mover advantage, perhaps they can swindle their way into issuing more stock at these dotcom prices. And even then, can they execute at this scale?  Can they win the hearts and minds of the automotive brand whores?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 01:06:05'] Other legacy vehicle manufacturers are catching up in the EV business and have greater scalability than Tesla. Audi eTron, Kia, Hyundai, VW, and Porsche have released some absolutely great cars and BYD can lay claim to cheap affordable nothrills EV with its Dolphin model. The only competitive advantage Tesla has is its proprietary battery arrangement that allows it to produce more powerful cars, and its autonomous driving. Its batteries are made by Panasonic and SS batteries designed by Sony and Samsung show potential to be better alternatives to Lithium ion.But then, Google also has this autonomous driving technology. However, Google founders were early investors in Tesla and I don't know if they still hold shares. If yes, then maybe that's why Google isn't selling its tech to car manufacturers.Edit: added autonomous driving after Google for clarity.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uu54n8/tesla_is_no_longer_the_largest_holding_in_cathie/'
POST_TEXT: b"Roku is officially the biggest ARKK holding as of today. It's crazy to think about Cathie Wood's biggest bet is Roku, a small streaming company that is losing market share to Google TV and it's not doing great recently. I just don't understand her thinking.."
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 12:11:02'] God sent an angel to Cathie while she was partying in the Caribbean with a message. "Buy Roku, their plan to make their own televisions is totally going to be a winner."
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 13:55:38'] The -80% of my ROKU long position seems all of a sudden much more sophisticated
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 15:38:11'] I actually agree with this move, although I don't understand why she believes ROKU is the pinnacle of innovation - it just seems like a fairly valued growth tech stock to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 07:14:34'] In a way, it makes sense to me that this would be her new largest holding given that I see a similarity between Roku right now and how Tesla was back when she started buying it years ago. And that similarity is a large percentage of people misunderstanding the company.For a long time with Tesla, people would say stuff like "it is just a car company" and "the competition is coming and then it is over for Tesla". Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.Now, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.Many people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.Roku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.I don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one. I'm very bullish on Roku at these current prices and I think that it has the potential to be a ten-bagger over the next decade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 18:31:03'] So…bullish on Tesla?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 17:31:11'] The way I see Teslas is the same way I saw iPhones back in the day. I would always buy the "iphone killers" that always had better features. At the end, iphones always kept that "high end" feel and even when you had cell phone companies that have been in the game for so long try and compete, the iphones just always came ahead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 19:15:12'] TL;DR no company is really producing EVs at scale with actual autnomous driving support. Most car companies are blowing smoke with no clear road map other than saying "we will double margins and have 80% electric car by 2045". Look at Waymo they've been in the game for so long with no real progress.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 17:43:04'] People have already explained the rationale for Tesla's valuation a gazillion times. At this point if you're still confused about the valuation, you either fundamentally disagree with the answer, or you're choosing to ignore the answer that people keep giving
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 19:00:52'] Because 800 is a number on the way up to 10,000.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 18:15:32'] Have you ever met a Tesla owner who hated their car? Most Tesla owners are fanatical about their cars. They really did change the auto industry - autonomous driving, electric vehicles, super charging system, etc
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:49:56'] You have to admit, Tesla created the electric car market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:01:17'] A lot of people try to answer that question everyday , some think it's a bubble ,try to short it , haven't worked out very well for them until now . The valuation is backed by the powerful persona of Elon musk , hype around the stock , a combination of shorts getting burned everyday and the fact that they keep promising and delivering . Also they are making an image of not being just a car company , but an AI , clean energy , robotics and crypto related too . Furthermore, there is the inflated market of the moment because of the money printing and interest rates very low that all combine to that market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:09:06'] Future earnings.  Future technology. Future paradigm shifts.Amazon had a 1000 PE ratio while they were burning millions in cash for a while.  TSLA is a similar story but it's not matured yet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:16:24'] Because in 2030, $800 billion market cap  makes Tesla undervalued and people buy stocks based on future projections.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 18:30:05'] People said that companies like Facebook, Uber, etc. (and many others that failed) were overvalued based on financial statement analysis. Overall I think Tesla’s strategy and product is solid. They’ve been a total disrupter in the industry by deciding to make “green” cars cool instead of just for environmentalists. They have been able to be profitable by making a $35k electric car that has waiting lists. It looks like they’re scaling production  in a way that will make them very profitable in the future. The biggest reason for me is they seem to be attracting the most talent in the field and I think there is potential for them to not just be a car company, but for them to change the whole transportation industry. 1. You could say that about a lot of industries. So far no company is close to where Tesla is at (IMO) and have aspects that are limiting their innovation. 2. If they can be a major player in transitioning the world to driverless cars and robotaxis I think they could justify their valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 16:25:47'] Try test drive a Tesla at your local Tesla center and you will understand how far ahead Tesla vs their legacy auto makers then you will be like me who put in order for a customize model Y which will delivery April 2022.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 11:19:50'] Hype
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 18:16:41'] 1) if you never driven a Tesla….you really don’t know how far other companies are in terms of service and utilities.2) American have been driving more since 2015 (even with remote work)……because more Americans especially 20-45 generation enjoy road trips. 2019-2020 (Obviously Covid-19 back driving). 3) if you go by valuations…..every stock is over priced. It took companies like Amazon and Apple over many years to hit 500b valuation and then magically in 2-3 over 1 trillion. Now above 2 trillion in a shorter timeframe. Prior to this Microsoft was a stock that always sat around 30-60 for many years but just in the last 2 years it went from 800b to 2 trillion in market cap. Microsoft always had high revenue throughout its history.4) Tesla is not only the starter of electric cars but their experience and technology is ahead of everyone by many years because Tesla has been spending money on R&D for many years on future technology, while the new start ups are worried about building a car and manufacturing for the mass.5) Traditional car companies transitioning to Electrical cars are hindered by “old thinking” and old branding. When you think of Electrical car, nobody thinks Honda, Volvo, BMW…Tesla is number 1 because to many those older brands, they just selling gas cars. Many of them don’t want to the the blackberry or Nokia (both of these companies dominated the phone market).If Tesla continues to lead and create new technologies…they will be the Amazon, Google, Microsoft of their field. So ask yourself why not?If you think it’s just a traditional car company….then you won’t understand it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 04:12:02'] People are pricing in massive future growth to Tesla, I think they're probably right.Those robot taxis are going to be Tesla's with autopilot.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:12:35'] Elon musk has a cult following. People see him as a God. If he dies tomorrow, watch that valuation collapse. It's not a sustainable business strategy. Seems like more of a religion to me. They make some nice cars though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 15:00:11'] The valuation of TSLA makes very little sense imo. You have to make a lot of assumptions about future growth and revenue streams for it to make sense, all which could happen but it doesn't present much opportunity when the best case scenario has already been priced in and the risks have been mostly ignored by investors.The stock is very likely to trade flat to lower for years. Although who knows what will happen over shorter periods. Sometimes stocks like TSLA are priced simply on the fact investors believe their will be a greater fool to buy it from them for more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 18:56:10'] I own two Tesla’s and I expect Tesla to hit 1T market cap within a year. I’d never buy another car other than Tesla. I’ve driven other EV’s and I’d compare them to the equivalent of driving a Honda Fit. Just not impressive. I own a small amount of shares and I’d pick up more on the way down if it ever dropped. Also the younger generation loves them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 21:11:47'] There is a common theme in all of the responses here.Everyone who thinks Tesla is a auto manufacturer believe it is overpriced. Well, it is. Only if Tesla sell cars.But it is not.A Tesla is literally a computer on wheels. Their business is actually the software that runs the vehicle. That's the future of transportation. Other auto makers are MILES behind Tesla in that regard. The fact that most still can't get their infotainment right is proof how far Tesla is ahead of them. Not to mention the massive amount of data they have over any other competitors, including company like Google, put them in a comfortable leads in self-driving tech as well.And that's just TWO killer aspects of the company.Tesla also own the charging stations, energy generation and distribution, which each on their own could generated massive growth for years to come as well as protect them from the eventual slowdown of the sale of their vehicles.Can you imagine Toyota merge with ExxonMobil AND a leader in solar power, and battery? Even then, they don't even have the same synergy like Tesla does.If you treat Tesla as a tech company, then the PE make sense. Comparing it to other auto makers is just fundamentally wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 19:49:56'] No other EV company has even close to the number of cars Tesla has on the road...which at this point is around 500k. This leads directly to your statement about other EV companies having “their own autonomous driving solution”...simply put: no other EV company will solve the autonomous driving problem unless they get as many cars on the road as Tesla. Why? Because that’s how machine learning works. Whoever has the most data points (cars on the road) wins. And Tesla has the most cars on the road by orders of magnitude....all of those hundreds of thousands of cars are providing edge cases to a neural net called dojo that is expanding every day

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 01:13:13'] 1.	Tesla is literally a few years ahead of everybody else. It alone outsold every luxury brand in the US in Q3. It grows twice every year. The demand is way higher than they can produce. They have the biggest infrastructure of superchargers that nobody is even close to. Their current software is pretty much precisely what early ios looked back in the days in comparison to Nokia and others. They are the only company that is trying to solve real-world AI problem (you can't imagine how huge it is). Even considering that all EV sales are right now under 4%. Tesla is also an energy and insurance business.2.	 It's a small part of it, very subjective and less relevant IMOTesla is a growing company, and the PE ratio is not what you should look at right now. If you looked only at the PE ratio back in the days, you'd miss Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and other great companies.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 11:51:23'] I don‘t want to lay out why tesla is valued as it is but just consider this:Soon there will be a 10k ev tax credit. Tesla has really good margins already and they are lowering costs and also raise prices in the last months. In the us all teslas are sold out until april so demand is sky high. So they could easily raise prices by 10k (to make use of the new credit) which would mean an additional 10k in pure profit per car. They‘ll sell like 600-700k cars in the us next year which means 6-7 billion in pure profit just from the coming ev tax credit. And this is just scratching the surface.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 11:59:13'] Because they are not a car company…they are an energy and software company.

The valuation is now so extreme you have to assume that not only will they dominate the car market going forward (Toyota laughs into its Ramen as it makes 30x as many cars to a much higher spec with a far better distribution network) but they will dominate OTHER industries as well. It simply cannot be. People who bought Tesla above 200 are gonna eat a gigantic bowl of liquid dog shit
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 15:02:34'] Your number two point is a positive not a negative .  Tesla plans to have its own robotaxi fleet.  Think about it .  Tesla’s mission is to transition us to green transportation, not to replace every car in earth one for one.  If one robotaxi can do the work of ten gasoline cars then Tesla has to make 9 less cars .   From a investors perspective reoccurring revenue is better than one time revenue .
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 16:12:23'] 1. Because they are making the best electric vehicles and are growing at an insane rate2.  They have high margins on their cars and they are getting even more efficient. They have two new factories about to come online, which should increase margins and at least double production. 3.  They have a visionary running the company. A guy who co founded PayPal. And who started a rocket company from scratch that reuses it’s rockets. He is the greatest genius alive now, and he is highly motivated. People expect that he will keep creating value. 4.  Autonomy.  If you can make a car that can navigate via cameras, you can probably also make a lot of other useful things that could replace untold amounts of labor.  This potential is why I personally have invested. 5.  Their energy business, solar roofs/panels, home storage, energy storage to supplement or replace utilities. Lots of potential here. I made the mistake of not investing earlier, because I was also concerned about traditional financial metrics. But I now think that they will become the biggest business on the planet within ten years, based on the above.

When the other competitors launch their own EV and self-driving cars, they would probably need to buy these map and driver data for their LiDAR scanners. Tesla by far owns the most data (google is second and it’s not even close to how much data Tesla has). In addition, Tesla (if they want to) is ready to launch their own ride-hailing app like today with the self driving system. That part may have not yet been factored in to the price. But yeah, most of their earnings are in the future and it is definitely overbought.

Everyone pays for "future earnings", so if you think a company will do very well in the future, to figure out how that should affect the stock price you use a formula and calculate what the share price should be based on projected earnings, BAM price is already higher than it should be (price to earnings) just based on this alone.3. This is a growth stock. Right now it looks expensive, but if you look at the stock in 10 years it is expected to grow rapidly, for years, especially as we all move towards electric rather than fossil fuel motors. Again, this is taking into account future earnings and market.4. They have a huge moat/advantage- name and brand, like apple. There are lots of EV companies, can you name them? I can only think of one off the top of my head. All the other companies are making cars and selling them for reasonable growth/profit, but when I think about investing in those other companies (e.g. canoo) I ask myself, what makes any of those companies special, or more like to survive/profit? Survivor/winner bias. Since Tesla is already "winning" everyone feels more confident that they will continue winning, compared to other EV companies.5. Theres a billion other damn good reasons, "meme" momentum (this is a real thing, and just Elon's single tweet alone can move Crypto and stock markets significantly, so don't under value this), effective leadership, diversification (tech and car), etc.

Not just in market cap, but by revenue.Your first point is very far off base. You need a better understanding of technology and to actually look at the balance sheets of these companies and the trajectory they are on.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 23:17:00'] M0 increased by 34% in the last year and money supply is slated to increase. Tesla is one of few companies with a growth trajectory that can provide investors with alpha in a market that’s being bled dry. Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, Apple etc are all other examples of incredibly inflated PE ratios.Also not to be all Cathy Wood, but the competition isn’t even close in terms of delivering value to their customers…
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 23:37:31'] The fact that they ave a virtuous mission will give them a perpetual hiring advantage that will act like a moat compared to legacy and most new rivals

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:05:26'] It's because Musk had seen the TED talk of Simon Sinek. "Start with why".[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF\_VuA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA)His marketing is perfect, like Apple's. Tesla is a cult. That's why people trust the company and buy cars in an online shop without having even sat in one.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:35:05'] Money isn't real.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:37:14'] Hype. Little true value. I mean, it’s not a bad company, but in my mind, the price of the shares are overinflated in my opinion. Other car companies out there can easily take over the EV market, but I believe we’re still testing the waters. Sure, Tesla is innovative, but it’s realistically not on the scale of something like Ford or whatever.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:43:48'] Because the people who buy it don't know what's market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:46:58'] People who don't believe in Tesla's valuation usually don't research the company very well. They just look at the surface and think "well other companies will do it too". However, when you really dive into it, you'll see how far ahead Tesla really is.  The engineering in their car is at least 5 years ahead of competition and the gap will keep on increasing because of the way the company is set up. Legacy automakers build a car by having different engineering teams build each of their component separately and benchmark performance to other cars. Tesla builds their cars by having all teams work together to build the best car possible. Not only that, their processes ensure that each improvement can be implemented as fast as possible.  Joe Justice did a video about this on youtube, Tesla implements about 27 production changes per week per model. Legacy automakers usually take months or years to approve a single change like this because they have to review each step of the production. An example of the impact of this is Tesla's recent delivery numbers that blew away estimates while every other automaker was cutting production by like 20-40% due to the chip shortage. The reason why Tesla wasn't affected as much is because they're able to use different chips and wrote their own software to ensure compatibility. People might say that eventually other automakers might be able to do this too, but by then Tesla is already going to be focusing on fixing another issue that legacy automakers didn't even think of yet.  Also, current production of ICE cars is about 100M vehicles per year, 2B cars in the fleet in total. Tesla that is the leader right now produced 500k EVs last year and is about to reach 850k this year. Even if all other automakers were able to catch up to Tesla overnight, there is still an insanely untapped market out there. As costs keep going down, EVs will easily outclass ICE cars from all perspectives. And IMO, legacy automakers are not currently setup to properly profit (yet) from this market without cannibalizing into their own profits (selling less ICE, massive costs of revamping their factories).  One thing that bothers me is that people give a lot of credit to Elon Musk and how he has a cult following, but engineers and other senior management at Tesla are just hella smart people. They deserve way more credit for their insane ingenuity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 00:55:48'] Every second news in my feed is about Tesla or Elon. Never do I see an article about Mercedes, Bmw etc. I also never click on Tesla news because they are all exagerations and click bait. I actually hide them but google keeps showing me Tesla news.Marketing, that's the reason why tesla is everywhere. They pay money to get exposure and hype Elon to mars.And sometimes you can see when campaigns start. After 1-2 weeks pause I start seeing Elon with some random facts everywhere (LinkedIn, reddit, google news etc) at the same time....this is just awful.... I am sick and tired of that psycho and seeing him everywhere......
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 01:35:32'] Because your point #1 is completely wrong if you do a bit of research beneath what any company says they will do.  A friend of mine said he'd go do his masters a decade ago and still says he will.Are the other companies actually doing those things? Nope
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 01:56:30'] It's the yearly growth. As long as they keep growing 50%/year, they can "justify" the valuation. Basically if you want to short tesla, you have to time when they stop growing that fast.Next year may be tough with the new factories, but Elon can probably hand wave it with new promises. 2023 should be interesting.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 02:41:22'] Proven exponential growth, you don't get that at the same scale other places. They just released 77% growth year over year, in the middle of a chip shortage and a pandemic. They are doubling down next year scaling up two new factories.They are building a car in 10 hours, the others in 24+ They gave an energy business comingThey have new models comingThey have the cash to push troughThey have the batteries
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 02:48:00'] Stocks trade on growth and anticipation of future growth. Tesla isn’t a car stock, it is a battery technology, autonomous driving, and renewable energy play. Amazon’s valuations were stupid in the 90’s but they ultimately grew into the valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 03:16:40'] Why? In the simplest terms: institutions that are holding aren’t selling. The capital that shorted it got squeezed. The people going long to speculate have cashed out into volume with little pullback. They’re going back in due to technicals still above 200ema daily.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 03:23:28'] REAL ANSWER : Elon Has NEVER sold
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 03:27:50'] Short Tesla Elon ain’t shit his engineers are open source and can take their skills and experience elsewhere which will eventually even all valuations more so than they are now
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 03:41:22'] They will likely grow into that valuation, however there's way too much potential downside on them right now to be buying, imo. Where is the upside at this point? If I bought last year, sure maybe I'd be holding, however there's no way I'm buying a company that's already one of the most valuable companies in history (and currently isn't justifying it).
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 03:54:27'] They aren't a car company. They are tech company that makes cars. They specialise in talent acquisition and rapid iteration to quickly discover most effective path. They are in multiple sectors, auto, software, data centres, ai, robotics, industrial process, material science, battery production (pack and cell), energy, (production, storage, arbitrage, utility scale). They are on track to dominate 20% of the auto industry as it rapidly transitions to BEV with industry leading profit margins approaching double the competition. On those 2 metrics alone that justifies a market cap 4 times that of Toyota that it has today. Then add all the other sectors on top. Tesla will likely end up licensing autonomous driving to other OEMs, and offer cloud compute neural network training capacity to other computer vision companies.They applied to be a utility in Texas so will probably start building a huge grid scale battery to act as a peaker plant and ultimately I think they will develop massive solar and battery utility system in Texas. It's all just waiting on ramping battery production internally and from partners. They disrupting massive old industries and leading the charge in new ones. That's why they have market cap of 800 billion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 04:11:25'] There are a lot of thing. But if i would pick 3 points which makes them more valuable than other car companies:1. They sell higher cost vehicles with higher gross margin which equals a lot higher profit per car. This is mainly due to software sales (FSD) and better manufacturing.2. The company is being run more efficiently than competitors which means less operating expenses. In other words - they can keep much more of the money they earn.3. They have a lead in technology and have some of the best engineers in the world which results in the gap widening instead of closing.So if Tesla sold 6 million cars with 47K ASP and 30 % GM it would equal 84,6 Billion in profit. If 10% of this goes to operating expenses we're down to 76\~ B profit, which is basically equal to the rest of the car industry combined. There are also high expectations for them to out perform the next couple of years (Faster growth than 50% annually which is their target + growing margins). Also they have multiple other products that could potentially take of (energy, fsd, solar, insurance etc.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 04:31:00'] Largest robotics company in the world, think of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 04:31:23'] Tesla and musk are easy to like. I love the things they are doing! I wouldn’t buy the stock right now but I do really like what they are doing. At this point even a bankrupted Tesla would have a spot in history IMO as a leader in EV when the next closest thing and everyone’s image of EV was a Prius when Tesla started.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 04:59:41'] 1) Being 'on track' doesn't mean they're doing it. (Even 'doing it' doesn't mean they are doing it at similar scale...or with competitive products)2) Robotaxis need to be manufactured by someone. Guess who that "someone" is going to be.3) Tesla is not a car manufacturer. They can easily shift their production capacity into energy storage (which is an even bigger field). So they actually don't care if the competition starts contributing (according to the mission this is even something that Tesla would welcome)

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 06:25:07'] Tesla is the only manufacturer who will be able to fully integrate in your life in the future, as Google and Apple did. They will sell you the most advanced car for the money, will give you the solar and batteries if you want to go green on your house, will be the utility provider for your electricity at home, give you the best charging network in the world and sell you the best insurance that will take as an input everything the car's autopilot is recording in real time. I am ignoring robotaxi for the moment as it seems to me from the latest shareholder meeting that if they want to licence FSD to other companies, robotaxi is not a priority for the company and they will probably run and milk FSD for many years until it becomes like a commodity so that legislation is not a problem. If licensing FSD seems an absurd idea,people probably don't realize that the competition doesn't have their own tech but mostly outsourced these capabilities to auto suppliers like Continental and others and just integrate it in an Audi, Mercedes, etc it's rarely something fully developed in house.

POST_TEXT: b"Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\n\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:30:02'] I think in the current market where the entire market isn't going up or down together, you have to be good at picking individual stocks.  I've seen plenty of stocks go up 20 to 30% in the last few months.  It's tough for 401k's because you can only buy funds instead of picking individual stocks.  For personal brokerage account, there should still be good opportunities.  Not that I've had any success with it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 11:04:20'] It is difficult to pick stocks right now. Lots of businesses that used to perform well are closing in on capturing the entire potential market and will slow in growth. Just think of facebook, netflix, disney, google, amazon, at some point there just are no additional wealthy people to capture as customers. Lots of other businesses are stagnating due to difficult economic circumstances. Even sectors that should be expanding and making money such as windturbines are doing badly, the giant Vestas even made losses!..   At this point I personally am unwilling to invest into the broader market. I search for individual stocks that might be reasonable purchases. Just look at for example the german DAX, its near the all time high in a time with record inflation and a very incompetent german government that is hellbent on wrecking germany economically trough regulations, immigration, stangling real estate market with refugee influx and environmental burdens that hamper new construction, bad energy policies, bad demographics (though to be fair thats relevant on a very long time scale and not imminently affecting valuations now). The EUR is in a bad position due to the need for rate hikes (that are not coming fast enough at all!) , what can they even do? with southern EU countries in debt, high rates are a big problem, they can not absorb the necessary rate increases. If the rates are not increased the EUR keeps devaluing and taking my savings down with it.Also need I remind anyone of the UK? they have food shortages right now. Its unbelievably stupid. We have a lot of risks in the market, risks of wars, risk of too much speculation in the market (excess liquidity), debt risks, war-risks, energy risks etc. At the same time a lot of businesses have accumulated a lot of damages and debt during covid. The rates increase, the damages increase. Growth is therefore much harder to achieve because funding it when you already are in debt, is much harder. I think this means there are sector winners and losers, those who survive with cash on hand/ability to refinance can take away market shares from those who suffered more. However: not investing is also a bad situation. You are guaranteed to lose money that way due to inflation. At least if you own stocks, the companys earnings long term should nominally follow inflation. So even if real earnings do not improve and growth is stunted, at least the nominal numbers increase.   But stocks also compete with bonds again. However bonds at this time can not result in real gains, you still make losses when accounting for inflation. So stocks offer a chance to beat inflation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:56:12'] "investors"...You keep using that word.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 23:48:53'] The market already probably went through the botom, look at the patterns and you will see that in January weve reached the usual 20%+ down from ATH and many tech stocks, legit ones like SQ and Tesla went on a 50%+ discounts, China stocks 80%, overhyped stocks, Disney is lower than 8 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:20:11'] im sitting on cash.   im still going with " dont fight the fed "'.  and how do u invest when good news is bad news ?   And bad news is bad news  ill wait.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 19:48:09'] I cashed out a lot of my safer dividend plays and various tech blue chips a year back. I know for a fact I can get in for cheaper than what I sold 15+ stocks for and I’m not going to miss the opportunity. Don’t listen to any crank that tells you that you can’t time the market. Things were very good over the past 5 years and current equity prices aren’t sustainable. Bad shit is down the line 2-3 years from now. It’s just the market is chugging along on the fumes of massive hopium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 20:31:08'] Some think this is a good opportunity to buy more growth stocks and indices. Dollar cost average some indices which have the tendendy later to move up after the receovery.  S&P500 the high market cap stocks sold by you will reduce the volatility. That index was never full of so many tech rich in the past.  Past success may not always indicate the future trend.I have also reduced my positions but I want to be even more contrarian as I suspect most easy money have been earned.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 03:33:11'] We still have potential to drop another ~50% from here. We’re really in the begin stages… we are experiencing an unraveling of free money economics that has existed for a generation or so now that has juiced the market, but not in a healthy way. The reversion to the mean is still early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:08:05'] Sold at top of recent rally at SPY 416, we will be choppy in the short to medium term as we’ve been for past year until the Fed Lag takes place.Sitting in Fidelity money market fund which I think is giving 4.1% interest right now.In my opinion we will continue to be choppy +-5/10% until the recession actually hits and I’d rather stay liquid and get interest so I have cash ready to deploy for when it happens. If you look at the construction sector you will see that the sector has been unbelievably resilient in the face of higher rates, but at some point that will end and construction layoffs will lead us into a recession.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 20:12:10'] I’m still invested but I do have a higher cash level than usual.  Been nibbling away at some undervalued stuff
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:13:20'] already cashed out.. more sitting on the sideline rn.. maybe go for more dividend or funds with high interest. No point going long and hold now when you know the market will go lower.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:21:41'] I did. In my account of 100k I now only have 20k in equities and the rest is in a combo of treasuries and a stable fund. Basically the treasuries I’m using to up my yield on the stable fund, but with most of my money in the stable fund in case there is a crash I have that money liquid and can deploy it quickly. All my treasuries are 3 and 6 month treasuries.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 16:30:49'] I started investing in individual stocks around august 2020 (I have etfs since before then). That was almost the worst time. But I have been buying multiple times since then. My individual growth stock portfolio is only down 15 percent despite investing near the peak and I have way more shares of the companies I love than before. I don’t get scared of the drops anymore (also because I have a lot of VTI and VXUS also and I also keep ample cash to buy the dip).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 16:50:42'] There are corrections, and there are heavier corrections, then there are shitshow scams that happen every 10-15 years.  This is an absolute Shitshow scam, and it's going to get worst when the debt ceiling BS comes to a head.  The DOW is going to have 500 point retractions regularly, and then a few drops of 900, topped by an 1,800 pt loss once Yellen announces we are going to default within a few days.  Or perhaps a credit bureau will lower the USA'S rating again, that's good for a 3,000 point two day retraction of the DOW.  When the billionaires that run this country and this ongoing scam see the market getting too volitile, and fear it's getting out of hand on the edge of total panic, threatening to get beyond their control, they will call their shorting off, and instruct the politicians to strike a debt ceiling deal, and JPOWELL to chill for a bit.In the mean time, buy SQQQ, join the short parade.  Don't fight the Fed, the billionaires, hedge funds and their scam.  Remember 2008, the market lost 60%, we are only half way there.   Maybe we don't hit 50 or 60%, but I don't see the bottom yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 17:05:16'] I’m down 20%. Holding for the long run at this point and average down when the bottom does fall out
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 17:17:57'] Stocks are too pricey. After the Fed hikes this month you can get over a 5% yield in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund with zero risk. It’s foolish to be buying stocks at a similar earnings yield.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 19:04:17'] Yikes just dollar average down. Idk normalFolks aren’t bright enough to time the market (god even the best of the best can’t necessarily time the market). Just buy good companies that have an extremely low risk of going under + continually buy the stock over time. The market goes up what 8% a year on average. You will do well. If you really wanna get into the nitty gritty of when to buy and sell, I would focus on looking at rsi over a 2 year + period. Try to focus on buying when rsi is 20-40 (oversold) and sell when rsi is 60-80 (overbought). If you look at historical charts for stocks- it’s normally close toBottoms around 30 or lower and the opposite at 70. Rsi to me is one of the best indicators. Just gotta focus on companies that are solid and face little bankruptcy risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 23:15:14'] I think there’s a ton of pent up demand as soon as the pivot actually happens we are going to see money flood in.

So if you think it's just going to burst even further instead, they are going to crash and burn.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 03:42:44'] In my opinion auto dealers in general are overvalued everyone is basing their valuation from the pandemic days where people were forced to buy over MSRP and dealers weren’t incentivized to give out deals. Analysts that believe in these companies are hoping that consumers will continually overpay for their cars and that manufacturer incentives won’t come back so that dealers can maintain margins. When you have people underwater on their overpriced car it’s going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand. Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They’re now down -16% from that earning report. There’s still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 13:04:40'] It’s not what we DO here to impress other people socially that matters ultimately. It’s how we socialize and treat other people. Positive minds are always equal to socially. Self worth is love within and showing it off to other people, not DOING stuff to get noticed. Humor in a mind, when authentic, is about sharing emotions (thoughts, ideas, and beliefs) that honor all people. There is no authority here. Serious minds, or minds that laugh but also look down on other people socially, share ideas and beliefs that are cruel and selfish. People always focus on vibe. We are all connected within non-locally (quantum entanglement). When human beings present a false image socially, which means the outer persona does not match the inner persona, it insults the intelligence and awareness of others. No one likes seeing lying in others about who they are within, when we already FEEL it and know the truth.We are all equal socially already. No one is on top, no one is on the bottom, and no one has any worth to prove to anyone. No one is an authority figure here. No one has a free pass to judge people more than others. Ideas rooted in social hierarchy are degrading, humiliating, and stupid.Type A bullies / alphas are not stronger than people that are mellow and friendly socially. Type A / alphas have low feelings of self worth, mental instability, problems with manipulation & dishonesty, and emotional issues. They take their own feelings of self hate and self loathing out on other people socially, unprovoked, for no good reason at all. Quite often the reasons people judge and cut other individuals down socially without hesitation and incessantly is ONLY because of a competitive nature, not because of a serious threat due to character issues in a person. Cheating in life is knocking people down socially to build up a social life. It’s a bad idea. People see head games in the minds of others. It’s important to be real about this and show honesty socially as much as possible.When people are authentic, they never use career, talent, physical stature / brawn, education, or money as a crutch for self worth socially. There is never a reason to “dominate” others in any area of life when we show or believe in love and friendship. Feelings of self worth come from kindness, honesty, and humility socially, not from social images. Dominators don’t believe in their own personalities or worth. They seek to tear other people down instead.Very often it’s nice, warm, humble, mature personalities that are already upset and insecure from judgments of the past that are knocked down unfairly even more by status seeking social elitists. People often see gentle human beings as “easy targets” to look down on so that they can attempt to build up their perceived status in an imaginary social hierarchy. Only conformists and shallow cowards think in these terms, not headstrong men and women with honesty, kindness, and respect. When people are unwilling to pass judgments as much as possible and want to remain friendly, level, and sincere socially, it’s not out of weakness. It makes a human being mentally sharp, emotionally strong, and much more mature socially. It’s a threatening attitude to people that show hatred and jealousy (judgments) socially. Judgements from status seekers usually have little actual substance or anything to do with character issues, violence in a personality, or antisocial, critical personality issues. Judgments from status seekers are hypocritical, shallow, cruel, and unfair. They ultimately cause violence and war.No one cares about showboating or showing off. No one accepts or tolerates authority in other people - it just seems that way on the surface. Everyone is a spiritual being that sees through bullshit. The more conceited the mind, the more dishonesty there is in it.People remain competitive only when they care little about working through their own judgments, anger, and character issues with other people socially. People stay competitive because they are afraid, not because they are happy or calm. Being competitive doesn’t make people “better”. It makes people nervous, angry, and depressed. Competitors only feel appreciated for what they look like on the outside and for what they are doing, then attack other people socially because they are in pain over not developing an honest, humble personality.It’s time for human beings to wake up and end war and human authority for good. It has no place here. Violence and social elitism is jealousy and anger resulting from the competitive nature of human beings. Human beings that do not believe in love, focus on self worth, have a desire to heal in life, or learn to respect other people socially will always remain competitive, forceful, shallow, dishonest, and aggressive.All people appreciate personality, warmth, and humor the most - not what other people DO to show off and impress people socially. That is just being real. Men and women either believe in love, or they do not believe in themselves.We are all spiritual beings. We are all psychic. Live the truth and heal self and others socially. It is the only way forward.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-08 02:52:23'] Probably worth mentioning the factory was shut down for a few days, but either way the growth is insane. It means Giga Shanghai by itself is already almost producing more cars than both factories combined in 2021. On top of that Fremont is hitting new production records, and Giga Texas and Berlin are ramping and will eventually surpass China. They're on track to delivery 500K cars in Q4, at higher ASPs and margins than the 300K in Q1.On top of that, with the battery and EV subsidies being added on, as well as the dry battery anode being scaled, they're on track to hit 40-50% gross margins on their cars. Other OEMs are at ~18%. They'll most likely be the most profitable carmaker in the world in 2023, and more profitable than all other carmakers combined in 2024 or 2025. A trillion dollar market cap in 2022 when the trajectory was already this clear will seem like a joke in a few years' time.

POST_TEXT: b"Hello, I have a question that I hope is simple enough to clarify for me. I appreciate any advice or thoughts. My spouse has some RSU shares that will vest in July, and I'm uncertain what it means that the recent Tesla announcement has tanked (hopefully for the short term) the EVgo, Inc. stock prices. \n\nI'm curious (as someone almost entirely unfamiliar with stock market behavior) if there's any typical advice I may be missing on when/if a person should hold RSU shares until a news announcement dip equalizes back to its average? Is that even a thing or is everyone now laughing because that's the magic question when engaging in the stock market?  \n\n\nI understand that any stock value increase/decrease after vestment date creates a capital gains situation with relevant tax implications, but is there a standard formula or view on selling vested RSUs during a reactionary slump or is that the name of the market game and we should just sell when we become vested to keep the income taxed simply"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 17:28:46'] You're asking about timing the market for a specific stock.A better way to think about it is this: your spouse has a bonus coming up of $X. Would you use it to buy EVGO during the slump? Or would you invest in something else?If you want to buy EVGO at this price, take the RSU and hold. If you don't want to buy EVGO at this price, convert it to cash and then invest the money as you see fit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 22:10:43'] EVGO is in a very shaky state. Do not lock up your investments and employment into one company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 04:45:57'] For me personally, I would exercise the RSU and re-invest in a low cost mutual fund.   You already have your salary and maybe a retirement plan tied up with them..  Eventhough you have faith in the company long-term goals, stuff happens and you could lose it all - just ask former Enron personnel.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 07:02:17'] Just do the math. If they lost $38 billion on a stock that went 7x in a year, how much will they lose on a stock that has already gone 150x in a year and could potentially 10x from here. Even if they didn't have nearly as much cash in the Popular Meme stock as they did in Tesla, which is far from certain, their losses will still be much greater.

What’s happened in the market tho is different....I think the VIX has been artificially inflated due to high volume trading over the last week or so. This has triggered algos to sell off...many factors such as 50 day moving average of the indexes contributed. To me this is normal, it’s just getting publicized and compounded by the Robinhoods of the world committing borderline criminal activity with the limiting of trading. Reality is this is and never was a free market. There have been multiple instances where the rules have been changed on the fly to protect the big guys.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 07:05:57'] This issue is important because short-seller hedge funds have been manipulating the market for DECADES (mostly unnoticed), and it is through a combination of many factors that these meme stocks have gained the virality to capture such public attention. Enough public attention that it then becomes extremely difficult to run their traditional playbook. Everything including the volatility of the market right now had been orchastrated to cause investor fear and distrust as to push people out and attempt to drive prices back down.I recommend reading [this report](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html). Its long but goes into depth on the various techniques that Short-seller hedge funds use in order to drive prices artificially down in low-vis companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 07:08:14'] The big deal about this meme stock was Robinhood and other traders openly removing the option of buying the stock. Even people who don't care about the stock market were pissed off when they heard about this. Both the Left and Right came out tweeting about it.No one ever stopped the sale of tesla. That's the real difference.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 09:58:02'] You don't understand, before, they had a way to buy back and close their shorts, which is much harder in the current situation because of the small float and the amount of people and institutions holding the stock. And remember, they are probably still shorting more than the total amount of shares in the market.If the price skyrockets, it might start triggering margin calls for funds, only accelerating the rise. It might reach a point where the debt a fund owes for their shorts is larger than the sum of its other assets, thus making they go bankrupt and maybe sell all their assets, creating a big dip in the whole market. So the clearinghouse would need to cover this and might be the same for them.What I'm trying to say is that they dug their graves on this one, but the media is trying all they can to make stock holders sell and avoid the bad outcomes for them.(This is not financial advice, just my personal opinion, do your own research)Edit: grammar

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 12:30:34'] It's because they completely backed themselves into a corner by shorting a certain stock in particular by over 100% hoping nobody would notice. It would be like going all in at a poker table and dropping your hand low enough that everyone sees you have a garbage set of cards while frantically attempting to bluff your way out of it with more money, convincing everyone else to fold, trying to get the casino shutdown, etc. They made a terrible bet (shocking, seeing as to how they are NEVER held accountable) and are indignant now that the FREE market is punishing them for it. Losing billions of dollars everyday in interest hurts these greedy, entitled fucks way more than a slap on the wrist from the SEC and they're finally starting to feel some pain.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 09:02:54'] I don't believe the contagion story, unless there is something else going on in the background. Some very quick maths, looking at how much it would cost to settle the market for everyone's favorite meme stock (cover shorts and call options) this Friday:    |Stock Price |To Settle Market Feb05 (mUSD$)||---|---||$300|$18,902||$325|$20,508||$350|$22,121||$375|$23,735||$400|$25,349||$425|$26,965||$450|$28,582||$475|$30,200||$500|$31,818||$525|$33,438||$550|$35,059||$575|$36,681||$600|$38,309||$625|$39,936||$650|$41,564||$675|$43,192||$700|$44,820||$725|$46,448||$750|$48,075||$775|$49,703||$800|$51,331||$825|$52,959||$850|$54,587||$875|$56,214||$900|$57,842||$925|$59,470||$950|$61,098||$975|$62,725||$1,000|$64,353|    Taking public float * short interest * stock price plus max(S-X,0) * 100 * open interest for calls as reported on Nasdaq.com Jan 31 2021.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 16:25:25'] Also don’t forget that while these losses sound big, this is across many funds who went short and most importantly they are plying with operating profit margin (OPM) not everything they have.In the case of GME the losses go far deeper having a knock on effect to the clearing houses and resulting in low liquidity. Now funds have to unwind other positions to cover their losses.No sympathy for the funds, big buying op coming soon I predict.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 08:32:03'] I wasnt paying attention but what % of tesla was shorted? I doiubt it was 100%.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 09:05:20'] Well keep in mind that they did make a big deal out of Tesla. The Tesla rally was in the news every day. I think the only difference is that during the Tesla rally there wasn’t a massive group on social media targeting the stock. This has gotten so much attention because it’s a massive movement of people using Reddit. WSB gets like half a million followers a day.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 09:50:13'] It’s not about the size of the loss it’s their loss of control. In Tesla they bet the price would go down and lost the bet. In the case of the current most popular meme stock they bet they could bankrupt a struggling company fire everyone and liquidate all assets for a profit. How did they make that bet? They naked short sold 140% of the stock and now with the little guys buying and holding shares there is not enough stock for them to get unshort. In 08 the little guy was forced to be the bag holder, in 21 the little guy is choose what bag to hold leaving the shorts (hedge funds) as the antibag holder (no idea if that’s what it’s called so I coined my own term for it)Edit: I forgot to mention they did this on credit similar to how we might trade on margin. The big deal is as the stock price goes up the shorts are getting the hedge fund version of margin called.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 11:03:54'] Because the news media was focused on "What's DT saying today on the twitter machine?".

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 13:55:16'] I'm dumb when it comes to the technicals here. But speaking more broadly, I'd say it's because this has become about regular people coming together to beat them at their own game, which they've been using to hoard wealth and screw over everyone else for years. Wherever things wind up going, we've accomplished something that protest has failed to do, that ELECTIONS have failed to do: found a collective action with the potential to really, genuinely hit them where it hurts.They'll do anything to crush that. They don't want people to make a habit of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 14:15:19'] In a nutshell, there is not enough stock available in the market for GME shorts to close out their positions. Short positions are currently at >110% of issued stock. That wasn’t and never has been the case with TSLA shorts.Edit: spelling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 14:35:42'] TSLA short interest was nowhere near 100%, let alone 140%. Also the available float of tradeable shares was higher than GME because they diluted shareholders a few times to raise cash. Short sellers did not have any issues closing out their positions when it went against them for TSLA.GME has a combination of a low float of available of tradeable shares (I believe 25%) and greedy hedge funds who put on naked shorts driving short interest to 140%. And despite what CNBC says about how WSB "doesn't know what they are doing". WSB is very aware of the position they are in. If they diamond hand their shares, they can set the price for what the overleveraged hedge funds have to pay to buy back their borrowed shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 18:08:29'] I love that it's like the perfect metaphor for the inequities in the US.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 18:32:23'] The obvious difference is time period. One year for $38B.The meme stocks? A couple weeks for $50-$70BN The other difference is that TSLA is estimated to have a value of around $500/share depending who you talk to. It's trading around high $700s. 30% above typical valuation.The meme stocks have a value of $5/share and $20/share (again depending who you talk to)They are trading up to $20-$30/share and $300-$500/share.400% to 2500% The other difference is that they have gone into the media and become a social movement. That's a story.A company losing $38BN isn't much of a story.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 18:34:52'] Speed is faster, scale is higher, and the higher gme goes, the more long position (ie rest of the market) need to be liquidated to cover (another 38 billion to go)

WallStreet doesn’t really give a damn what happens to a few hedge funds and most WallStreet trader and banker are watching on the side with popcorns. Hell, I’ve talked to a few buddies who works in WallStreet and they say people don’t even talk about this. They are more worried about interest rates. This whole class warfare and it is time to take it to WallStreet is just a giant pump and dump by WSB vets. Novice investors are going to end up holding GME at 500 basis. And more regulations are going to added on retail.

People on Reddit actually believe that they are responsible for pumping up the stock to $470 action as a way of "sticking it" to the man.  But really other hedge funds and larger institutional investors pumped up the stock.  The majority of the trades on this stock are being done with million dollar purchases.... not under $200.People don't want to feel like they were manipulated into allow these large investors to pump and dump the stock.  I suspect tomorrow we'll start seeing a lot of this stock get dumped and people will care less about it.

POST_TEXT: b'https://apnews.com/article/tesla-recall-full-self-driving-software-e23d252ac5164cb0e7af776625b15180\n\nDETROIT (AP)  Tesla is recalling nearly 54,000 cars and SUVs because their Full Self-Driving software lets them roll through stop signs without coming to a complete halt.\n\nRecall documents posted Tuesday by U.S. safety regulators say that Tesla will disable the feature with an over-the-internet software update. The rolling stop feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) per hour.\n\nThe recall shows that Tesla programmed its vehicles to violate the law in most states, where police will ticket drivers for disregarding stop signs. The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices, said it is not aware of any state where a rolling stop is legal.\n\nTesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to document'
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 10:44:10'] That’s a long-winded way of saying Tesla pushes software update.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:06:20'] Bullish.  Running red lights and stop signs gets you to the destination faster.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:00:46'] oh waow, a software update for the FSD beta lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 10:45:16'] Seems like a feature and not a bug, lol.  People would pay to secretly reactivate this if they could.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:57:56'] It a new feature called “no cops - no stops” beta testing will begin shortly
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 13:26:37'] Cool. If it falls below 900 I'm getting buying more. This is nothing to worry to much about if there were no attributed casualties.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:34:33'] Self-driving is not going to happen anytime soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:49:17'] This headline is so misleading.  The software was allow to do a rolling stop at very slow speeds when no other cars or pedestrians were detected.  I agree it should come to a complete stop, but to say it’s running stop signs is a bit clickbait.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:06:20'] So am I the only person who actually read this and noticed that Tesla explicitly programmed their system to break the law? I really hope regulators step up soon because this is ridiculous.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 13:12:32'] This is just hilarious. The depth people are willing to go to slander anything related to Tesla is hysterical.1. People need to stop calling OTA updates as 'recalls.' Just because legacy automakers can't properly issue relevant OTA updates in the scale Tesla can, doesn't mean this qualifies as a recall. This is literally a software update that you can update within a couple of minutes.2. This only affects beta FSD users. Has nothing to do with Tesla vehicles in general.3. The program only works when the vehicle does not sense any vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclists. The vehicle will only travel 5.6 miles, max. Also, the vehicle in the intersection must also have a stop sign in that intersection and cannot be traveling more than 30 miles on that road. In short, EVERYONE does this.... Every single driver on the road, with or without this beta FSD, driving any car, has done a rolling stop. If you haven't, you're a liar.&#x200B;In short, this is a non-discussion. No injuries were reported because of this. The only reason it came to light is because Tesla met with the NHTSA to discuss whether they can have this feature on. They determined no so Tesla opted to just remove it.Sorry, legacy automaker investors. But there is nothing to see here.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:17:44'] "runs stop signs" is kind of sensational given what it does. it's a rolling stop.still can't legally do that, but the headline makes it sound like it's just blowing through stop signs treating them as a suggestion.ironically enough, the rolling stop is probably a fuel efficiency thing tesla implemented, since presumably it uses less charge to get back up to speed after slowing down than it would from going to a complete stop. if self driving cars can safely do this automatically, it SHOULD be legal.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:39:54'] I genuinely believe that FSD won't be a major factor in EVs for at least 5 years.    Make a 'cheap' great looking EV with driver assist & an incredible infotainment center - people will be throwing money at it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:19:46'] Frankly as a relatively new technology in personal transportation it's more amazing how smoothly it's going. Sure there are lots of problems but in the past practically everything not legacy were abysmal failures.

Maybe it was Volt...both were irrelevant contributions."over the internet software update" = recall....I guess they do have to speak in terms they understand, and recalls are GM and Ford's primary language.Is it still advisable to wait at a green light in and around Metro Detroit because full human drivers still go speeding through red lights?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 13:31:13'] Even before this TSLA was and is the most overvalued stock in the market, more of a giant meme stock and cult following of Musk than a real company. if judged as a real company it is successful but only has modest growth, plus as this story highlights, many potential problems with the tech.  PLus within a year Tesla will be deluged with competitors and some of those EV's may become more popular that teslas. Right now TSLA is valued at 30% of AAPL and three times the market cap of Toyota the world;s real #1 car maker. TSLA;s non car business is also shrinking and Musk has admitted no new models will come out this year because of supply chain shortages and becaue he is focused on other things like a robot and landing men on  Mars.  Musk also tweets a lot of kokky self center nonsense and recently touted a worthless adolf Hitler crypto coin.  Madness and also madness to accept Dogecoin as payment since tht POS isn't worth anything and may not even exist six month from now.So what if the fair value of TSLA?  About 70% less. It's best growth rate is max 30% and it now has a PE of over 100.  Plus all the new competition is bound to take a big chunk out of the EV and tesla pie.

POST_TEXT: b'\nToday was an ugly day however moving foreword what do we have in the TSLA horizon? Well September 30 we get Tesla Ai day so we might see a potential recovery leading up to that day. Also, October is around the corner and well get to see Teslas delivery numbers. The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside. But perhaps deliveries will aid that. \n\nAll in all, Im bullish Tesla. Its a mega cap that has been performed relatively well. I think that this low price per share will also make investors perceive a lower price for a company effectively going full'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 20:51:47'] Why would closing showrooms cause cancellations?  More likely, people are cancelling because no one can afford a Tesla anymore, especially with electricity costs being what they are in Europe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 23:11:50'] TSLA will kill earnings and should absolutely outperform the market just as it has already in 2022. But don’t expect much if the market shits the bed
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 23:18:29'] My opinion: good company, way overvalued. Why do you think 300 per share is a buy? If it's 400, would you still buy it? Why and why not?Short term prediction is a gamble, no one knows for sure. Too many factors (both tesla specific news and general stock market movement) that can drive either way. Stock market can be irrational. Look at the dead cat bounce june-aug. If your horizon is at least 5-10 years, you'll do fine. It does not matter much if you buy now or few months later, just keep dca. But don't put all your money into one basket.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 01:11:48'] i think i heard elon musk say something along the line if fsd dont perform tesla probably wont worth much.  i personally think robotaxi is not possible in 10 years unless tesla consider geofence, and even then other company probably do geofence robotaxi better.

POST_TEXT: b"The Tesla Cybertruck delay was already a known fact, but CEO Elon Musk's latest reported comments add a few more details to the picture. Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com"

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-03 19:34:01'] Lots of reasons contributing to this delay:- World supply chain is really messed up by COVID, at least Tesla is still growing at a breathtaking speed. Legacy carmakers however are having one plant shutdown after another.- 4680 batteries are not quite there yet, as the latest rumor has them at [70-80% yield](https://businesblog.com/teslas-4680-battery-cell-pilot-production-line-hits-70-80-yield-report/). That article from a week ago already anticipated more Cybertruck delays. - During [Tesla's AI Day](https://youtu.be/j0z4FweCy4M), it was mentioned that Cybertruck should have the HW4.0 for self driving, which is also under development.- The massive [Steel Dynamics facility in Sinton, TX](https://www.steeldynamics.com/) is still under development but near completion, and will be proving Cybertruck's steel.- Demand for Model Y seems larger than Tesla had anticipated a few years ago, so more company resources have been allocated to its production

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 04:49:06'] This isn't significant to the bottom line.It's a black eye, but Musk's fanbois shrug off qualitative negatives about his companies.The bigger issue is the growing competition, which they still don't recognize as a threat. They see a couple of factories coming online and think those will keep Tesla in the lead. But there are many more competitor factories coming online and a large spread of function and price coming to market. The TAM is losing chunks every time a new model is introduced, and many of those models are in Tesla's wheelhouse.The stock is priced for heated growth and robust margins, and the universe is going to crush both.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 11:36:03'] It'll keep being delayed so they end up scraping full production at some point as most people end up cancelling their reservations..it'll flop either way.. there is no way it'll sell close to even a model Y. so I can see it being a limited release.

But still, not only are they out $250k, they lose out on all the returned that the $250k could have generated between 2017 and 2023, if the car is even delivered then. Elon Musk raised well over $100M of free capital based on a promise. Such as the power of the cult of Elon. I wonder how many of those people asked for a refund.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-05 10:46:31'] As a software developer, I have been constantly asked about when a feature/improvement could be done. For something that has been done before, the estimate delivery could be estimated more precisely. But for something that I have not done it before and need more experiment, the estimate is not easy to give. It is common to have new challenge that was not thought of initially. Nevertheless, we have to give estimate  as managers want it, most often, more optimistic estimate would be given to meet management expectation. Tesla has done a excellent job so far. Tesla cars look futuristic. Tesla’s vision aligns well with what I think the future would be. To be fair over-promises are probably more due to design challenge. I am sure investors want optimistic promises too. Thinking that Tesla is over valued due to product delay is really over statement. And betting against a company that many want it to be successful and it runs well and it has great products  seems an awful investment choice.

However the rest of their line up looks amazing. Roadster delay isnt that big of a deal but is superficially disappointing. As in doesnt look good when a company keeps delaying but nbd. But officially saying it's not a priority with deposits like that looks bad imo. Stock will probably be fine for the next years regardless.

Of course Tesla is bound to have a few pumps. It doesnt have to reach $200 by September, all it had to do was move in the upward direction and it made him $7k. How is this risky??

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:14:35'] Fuck around & find out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:23:47'] because if it doesn't go the way you want you lose everything by expiration
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:30:50'] You’re using to hindsight knowing that $160 was the bottom and assuming it was easy money. What if he spent that $14k and it kept dropping, he would’ve lost everything. Options are very risky, but can pay big. Options you have to guess the direction AND time it correctly. What if Tesla went up to $190 in September and then pumped up to $250 in October? He would’ve lost everything even though he was correct in the direction, but was wrong on timing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:26:46'] All trading is risky. Options are higher risk higher reward.Why? They have a deadline. And the closer they get to it the exponentially worse their value becomes in comparison when trading the value of the contract itself. And if the trade doesn't go in your favour by the deadline you lose 100% of your investment. But there are ways to use them that are lower risk too. For example, if I'm entering a trade with shares and decide I'm happy to risk 10% of my investment and put a stop loss there I could have instead took whatever money that 10% loss would have represented and purchased calls with it instead. Or if I buy 100 shares I can lower the risk of the trade by also buying a Put to cap my max loss instead. In these scenarios options buy you time instead of time working against you because a stop loss just triggers. Whereas with options you get until expiry for the trade to recover.That's barely scratching the surface of greeks and options strategies. And in that lies the main risk. People trading options that don't understand what they are doing, get lucky, get addicted, keep going and then eventually hit a big loss and it's all gone.Like sure that Tesla trade you provide as an example was a great trade with a decent amount of time given to it and they took profits. But if you're in certain communities you'll see people do trades like that then YOLO the entire thing into a 0 DTE SPY option for a FOMC meeting, get it wrong and goodbye money. I've seen loss porn 6 figures big regularly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:47:17'] Firstly, because options have an expiration. So it’s entirely possible you’ll lose the money. And I don’t mean sell at a loss, I mean poof, it’s gone. Secondly, on WSB, they tend to use Robinhood. And Robinhood isn’t great, and I’ve seen several posts of people not understanding how much risk they were taking on. One person was getting margin called for $350,000. Lastly, go back to WSB and see how many people blew up their accounts trading options.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:46:54'] To make a profitable buy option trade  you need all of these in your favor:1- Timing of move - in the right direction2- Speed of move - in the right direction3- Exit at the correct time - if both the above things go right for you.To make a profit you need everything to go right. If not, you loose the amount you used to buy the option.Over a large enough sample size, probability of being right on the first 2 factors right next to impossible, being correct on 3 .........
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:50:04'] It is definitely not risky (as much most think) as far as the umbrella term "options trading."If anything it can be less risky than buying stock, but yes, it can also be quite the opposite.What the WSB user did was lottery YOLO, versus trading. There's some gambling aspects in trading but it can\* be more focused on educated, probabilistic trading. Plan and management driven, so to speak.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:38:34'] Best way to learn is experience. Go trade options for the rest of the year and then report back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:22:05'] Short term price direction isn't usually easy to predict.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:57:39'] its an asset type with a defined, fixed "expiration" date, where you WILL lose everything, if you hold that long. Bonds, stocks, CDs, other assets don't have expiration dates.Because options are also based on something underlying, they move in multiplicative and exponential ways, which makes them extremely volatile. Again, not so with other asset classes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:37:52'] Ok I’m an options trader and will clarify some misconceptions here. Like all asset classes there are riskier strategies and not. Just like stock trading there are riskier stocks and not so risky stocks. I would actually consider a buy and hold strategy of SPY (or any other stock) to be a riskier strategy than the way I trade options. The guy bought a call on TSLA out of the money expiring in Sept. The risks are that the stock drops. It may never recover and because of time decay even if it goes back up he may still lose money (or all or most of his investment) if there isn’t enough time left to hit the strike price. An option is priced according to five “Greeks”. Delta, theta, gamma, Vega and rho. You should have a good grasp of the Greeks before touching options. Most people who invest in stocks look for one way to profit. The stock needs to go up. (Or you can short but I gather most people don’t short stocks as it’s more complicated.) As a net short options trader I can profit in any market environment, bearish, slightly bearish, neutral, bullish or extremely bullish. I have strategies I can employ for whatever market environment. I also can limit my max loss on any one trade and believe it or not reduce volatility and risk as compared to a simple buy and hold strategy. I control probability of success and amount of profit and loss. There are trade offs for each of course but you just need to know what you’re doing and appropriately size your positions and trades. So the bottom line is it isn’t that “options trading is risky”. It’s how it’s employed. For example investors in SVB who have all of their money in one stock would’ve lost all of their investment employing a buy and hold strategy. Similarly the investor who shorted puts would’ve had their whole account wiped out and then some  if they over leveraged. The issue isn’t so much with options trading as it is with position sizing. That is what gets people into trouble. The OP thinks that this is free or easy money. Nothing is free or easy. Everything has trade offs. As a successful options trader I don’t worry about how much I can make. I worry about how much I can lose. And I size my position and max loss potential to reflect that. In my years of trading stocks and options I can tell you that being a net short options trader gives you a far higher risk adjusted return than a simply indexing strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:45:05'] I thought options trading was safer since you have more options
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:13:05'] Only if you buy options. If you sell options and you want to own the stock or ETF anyways then selling imho is way safer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:19:27'] You can be right, and also be wrong at the same time. Losing money when you’re right is why it totally messes with your head.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:27:20'] Greeks
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:44:36'] Because if you're wrong or don't do proper risk management, losses are big.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 19:51:26'] I believe most options expire worthless. As I recall the number might be about 75% because of how the math works out. There's also some things with options you have to worry about that you don't have to with normal stocks. Time decay is one of them. As time goes on, your options get more and more worthless if they don't move the right way in price. >This week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.Risk $14,000 expiring as $0, and you made $7,000 (assuming he sold as soon as the 7k in profit hit, if not it will likely go to 0). Does that sound like a fair deal to you? You can do the exact same thing by just buying the stock. The only thing options give you is more leverage, but they take the benefits away by charging you in things like time decay, implied volatility, and market expectations. With all that said, there are some far less risky ways to play options, but just buying them is not 1 of them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 07:26:33'] Buying options like you have suggested is extremely risky, it’s basically gambling. Nothing wrong with it if you know that’s what it is. What it’s not is investing. Now, selling options is very safe and is not gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:14:31'] It has lots of dimentions, the easyness to trigger the button to play thowsands of contracs with little money, lets say you start with 10000 usd, and play to think that with expiration day this can be 1 Million, yes it CAN be but with low very low probability, the problem Arises when you start to win in the beggining, you will be undestructable you might think, then you will start to bet more and more untill you get nothing, the best way to mitigate this is by buying a good book about option trading and hedging and use money management.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:30:03'] If you buy stocks you have to be right about direction (up/down). If you buy options you have to be right about direction, the timeframe (expiration) and the size of the move. If you guess wrong, you lose. You can lose half of your portfolio within weeks with options. Be careful. There is no free lunch.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla Inc. is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell, with Wall Street worried it will be a difficult quarter for the electric-vehicle maker amid ongoing supply-chain snags and pandemic-related factory shutdowns. We fully expect a difficult (second quarter), based on continuing supply-chain issues and factory shutdowns, said Bill Selesky, an analyst with Argus Research.\n\nTesla TSLA, 0.55% earlier this month reported a quarter-on-quarter fall in deliveries, its proxy for sales, leading some analysts to cut their expectations for the EV makers quarter. But some of the issues facing Tesla are already accounted for in Wall Street estimates, and investors are aware, Selesky said. He said he expects Tesla to modestly beat expectations thanks to reduced costs and relatively strong margins.\n\nDan Levy at Credit Suisse said the key question for investors next week will be the magnitude of margin pressure from the Shanghai shutdown due to Chinas COVID zero policies'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 11:50:57'] Their issues with China are well known at this point and if they can beat or be near expectations, I expect price to pop in the short term. If the China crackdowns continue through the summer and Q3, it could get ugly for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 08:43:40'] Well everyone knows China was shut down for weeks. I think the price action will depend on guidance more than anything else. If they can meet or get close to their annual production goal then everything should be fine. Demand is robust and they kept raising the price of their cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 16:29:46'] Key update is production rate at Berlin/Austin. If that can ramp up to 5K per week before end of the year, they will be in a great shape. That is another 500K cars.

POST_TEXT: b'I heard from a lot of people TSLA is overvalued, a big component is other manufacturers are "catching up."

FSD and how it they\'re saying 160,000 customers are testing the beta, when they only had 2000 last year with a ton of pull request from the fleet of cars.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 17:58:50'] I have buddies who are devs and engineers at GM and Ford teams that focus on automation. They are paid great, have good work/life, and enjoy solving the issues related to their tech. The companies don't have to publicize the work these teams do because the primary focus of these companies is the production and delivery of cars, which they do far better than Tesla. Tesla has to focus on FSD because tech is their value proposition, not delivering cars. Judging by Musk's own admission the self-driving tech needs to be improved 5x-10x to be usable in a commercial sense, which means we are probably a decade or two away from it being on the streets, at which time Tesla will likely be mostly out of the auto business and auto manufacturers will have their solutions on the road.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:25:03'] Considering the way Musk sees and treats his workforce, I have no idea why anyone would want to work for him. Their A.I is neither special or revolutionary, Google, Apple and Nvidia will easily beat them at their own game
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 19:18:13'] I'm a Tesla shareholder but not blinded by fanboyism . Don't want to bust Tesla fans bubble but AI is not essential to cars, so not being essential the manufacturers will just integrate a third part solution to the models that will require it, when it will be required. Google, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia could pivot to this field when there is a need, Google is already half way there with Waymo. Robotaxi meaning L5 autonomy will not be needed in every car, and if it ever gets approved will never be allowed on a global scale for obvious reasons. At a global level, people transport sector is one of the most regulated ones, not to mention the lobby and full on bribery. That is not going away because Tesla figured out driving.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 14:39:51'] Considering Tesla did this in only 6 to 8 months versus Boston dynamics, who hasn’t done anything more with their project in 10 years. I’d still say Tesla is set to be a world super power by 2030.

That means the company, whose valuation hit $1 trillion earlier this year, is likely to begin producing the same batteries elsewhere sooner.Source: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/tesla-forced-to-turn-down-e1-1-billion-in-eu-support-for-german-battery-plant/
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 15:07:01'] There's some reports that Tesla may have been forced to turn the money down due to stipulations in it. Some articles on this say that the Berlin gigafactory would have to be the first to produce the 4680 batteries, but that it's at this point it's looking like the other factories will be making them first.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 20:48:36'] Tons of misinformation going on here. 1. This was Tesla's decision. The reason Tesla pulled the application is because they knew they would no longer qualify. Germany's spokeperson for the Economy Ministry said as much.2. The offer was that Tesla had to manufacture their 4680 cells at their Berlin factory first. Meaning, this Berlin factory had dibs. The subsidies were offered because Germany wanted to rely less on imports and turn Germany into the EV-central of Europe. If you've been paying attention to the development of their factory, the Berlin factory has been taking longer than they would like because of government approval. They are STILL waiting to be approved before they can start production. Meanwhile, their Texas factory is also capable and further along the process to produce these batteries. My guess? Tesla had planned to start their 4680 battery production in Berlin, it took longer than expected, and so Tesla is moving on with it in their Tesla factory. 3. I don't work for Tesla nor do I have insider knowledge but there are people who make these decisions internally who have the data and skills to weigh the pros/cons. Right now, it seems Tesla believes the delay in this Berlin factory is not worth putting their 4680 battery production to a halt. This 'delay' is worth more to them than the $1.3 billion subsidy.4. “It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated, ***but that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas,”*** Musk tweeted after the ministry’s announcement. ***“For some reason, governments don’t want to do that …”***  Elon never stated that Tesla wouldn't take subsidies. He stated that they don't believe in subsidies but currently, the oil/gas giants being lobbied receive hundreds of billions in subsidies. It wouldn't be economically feasible for an EV maker to exist without these subsidies. Take for example, Norway. EV's are more affordable than ICE vehicles because of subsidies. If not, the adoption of EV's would take much longer. Remove subsidies for the oil/gas industry and the cost of owning an ICE would increase, rapidly. We all know why they won't do that... because the oil/gas industry is one of the most heavily lobbied industries with ties to politicians across governments.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 00:23:20'] As a German, the slowness of our processes in this regard is a true economic disadvantage. One obviously shouldn’t take Musk’s statements at face value, though. This is pr speak, nothing more, nothing less.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 19:13:45'] Germans probably wanted more control over decisions Tesla makes in their country. Tesla is built on government cheese
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 19:48:33'] You have to be pretty dumb to think Elon would turn down subsidies, and even dumber to believe what he says. Tesla can't meet the EU requirements to qualify for the subsidies so he's backing out early.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 03:27:49'] This is all bs folks. The money he declined definitely came with requirement of unionization. Now he's trying to roll it back. What he fails to understand is that German's won't work without union anyways unless he pays them so much it is unnecessary.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 08:50:38'] He probably doesn't want to share battery technology and the code with BMW which could be hidden in the contract, Germans always promote their domestic champions, once Tesla loses its CC they will have a harder time competing against the old guard of the car industry like BMW or Volkswagen.

So Tesla is given the opportunity to save face and “withdraw” from the subsidy application.4680 is another myth product of Tesla that, as soon as Elon can do it, will get warehoused Raiders of the lost ark style with the rest of Elon’s stock pump products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 11:51:52'] In a way, it makes sense to me that this would be her new largest holding given that I see a similarity between Roku right now and how Tesla was back when she started buying it years ago. And that similarity is a large percentage of people misunderstanding the company.    For a long time with Tesla, people would say stuff like "it is just a car company" and "the competition is coming and then it is over for Tesla". Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.    Now, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.    Many people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.    Roku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.    I don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one. I'm very bullish on Roku at these current prices and I think that it has the potential to be a ten-bagger over the next decade.

Any SmartTV makers can employ cheap software engineers in Asia to write up a simple GUI using Linux OS in a few months, and not paying a dime to ROKU.

GM, Toyota, Ford, Harley...the list is endless. Too protectionist, excessive fees & taxes, red tape at every level...the only carrot India offers is its 200m+ upper middle class that can afford to take on huge debt to make these big ticket purchases while the govt. will twist tesla's arm for concession after concession. India will welcome them with open arms and once they setup, invest hundreds of millions, establish themselves and the IP and specialized skills and knowledge is replicated by local manufacturers to compete, the government will make it harder for them to do business in India. Eventually they will have to sell to a local manufacturer like GM sold their design center to Tata (which owns Tata's automotive unit that owns jaguar and range Rover).
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 07:30:33'] Rightfully so. Its tough to do business there b/c government imposed hurdles and lack of infrastructure like basic roads and reliable electricity sources.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 08:00:07'] The bottom line is that right now every EV maker is capacity constrained and sells everything they can build at any price tag. Until that starts going back to normal there's no need to hunt for new customers in complicated markets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 11:26:38'] Tesla will have to innovate significantly in order to cater to Indian customers appetite. This is the reason why GM, Apple failed but Chinese companies like Xiaomi , TCL do so well. Tesla cannot just expect to sell the cars it sells in the US to Indians. Auto pilot or Range won’t matter in India. Durability, maneuverability and charging infrastructure would matter the most. Teslas are expensive but cheap feeling cars that wouldn’t fly either. It’s best they don’t enter Indian market without understanding local demographics. Manufacturing in India is a different issue. Setting up manufacturing centers in India are nearly zero cost and sometimes negative cost too, every aspect is subsidized.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 07:55:26'] I never understood the point of going into India in the first place. There's just too many issues with the country.* There's too much protectionism in place to keep out foreign competition. There's a reason why India is the one country where Apple products have never gotten any kind of meaningful hold on the market.* The average Indian is so poor that probably only the top 1% could even afford a Tesla in the first place. So despite the large population of India, I don't think it's worth jumping through all those hoops just for so few customers.* Other countries in the region have better infrastructure for manufacturing and exporting it to other countries, plus expertise in that area. This is a big part of why everything is made in China, it's not because Chinese workers are the cheapest, there's plenty of other even cheaper countries they could build factories in but don't.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 04:31:36'] This growth while operating with pretty much the same margins as Ferrari is bonkers to me. And at least here in Europe I fully expect it to keep trending high on sales. Everyone talks about them. Everyone wants to own a Tesla, it's insane how the brand is seen. Every time one passes by on the streets you can hear someone pointing and commenting on how there is a Tesla going through.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 12:42:52'] What's really surprising about this is how poorly every other automaker is doing. It would seem like someone would be able to do good margins and good volume and be a profitable company. Or failing that at least be consistent and steady and unleveraged on average.But the global auto market looks like it's cut throat, with tiny margins, and is barely scrapping by in the periods between one crisis and the next crisis. There's some brands that can charge good margins, but they have real problems scaling that up. The most reliable segment for long term profits over the last couple decades has been luxury SUVs, but even there over investing in that segment caused serious problems for major players when there was an economic downturn and consumer preferences shifted in the short term.At first glance, it would seem like EVs are a godsend for the incumbents, they get to sell a whole new kind of car to all their existing customers. And would hopefully be able to get some subsidies to do it, or at the very least get out from underneath increasingly stringent emissions regulations. But basically no major incumbent is embracing EVs as an answer to their long term problems. For a long time they barely made any, just enough to meet minimum compliance needs. And even now they're not investing nearly enough to capture decent market share, while still relying heavily on segments that are going to be problematic long term (mostly SUVs).And when you dig in to their balance sheets, it starts to make sense. They make a huge amount of money selling parts for the existing fleet of installed vehicles. If they push out new cars, that are much less complicated and much more reliable, to replace the aging installed base, their parts sales profits are going to disappear. It will be incredibly hard to fund a transition to new products if they're losing short term profits from high margin vehicles, and also cutting off a steady supply of long term profits from parts. The only real option is to dive in completely and commit to the new market, and it doesn't seem like anyone is willing to make that jump?Part of the issue might be that most automakers also rely on financing to make money. They're basically banks that also sell cars, and I'm sure that creates a very difficult management structure, especially if you need to convince everyone to make a huge commitment to new a new engineering and manufacturing model.It's kind of like how [airlines basically became banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4) and rely on loyalty programs to make any real profit. It creates a really perverse structure for anyone that's trying to make big changes to the "core" (or what should be the core) business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:18:16'] BEV (Nissan Leaf) has been my only car since 2015 so I'm fully on-board BEV train and have long hoped (but did not expect) it will S-curve this decade . . . but prior to 2021 I had assumed Tesla was a niche brand that would be lucky to top out at ~2M/yr (BMW-scale) this decade once the competition filled in the BEV markets.Today's market cap prices in ~3M/yr stable market share as you say.6M/yr (GM-scale) is on the table, 9M/yr is a bullish reach case but not impossible, and of course with robotaxi 20M/yr is what the company itself is targeting.Robotaxi/FSD revenue is another factor that appeared post-2020. Like Gary Black I value it at $0 since like all super-hard problems the last 1% is 99% of the work.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 03:44:35'] You’ve forgotten that apparently on an annualized basis, Tesla is making about $2.4 billion a year selling “regulatory credits” to other US manufacturers to offset their gas fleets. Folks like Ford, GM and VW. All 3 of which have multiple models of evs in the short term pipeline (as well as some on the road already). Point is, that revenue is short lived and has absolutely nothing to do with selling cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 05:05:40'] Musk is just a good salesman and everyone got sold. It’ll come crashing back down to earth one day. If anyone buys the stock right now at $1T you know nothing about finances and how the world works.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 18:34:50'] Factoring in demand is another point. EV market only is only a part of the auto market, and by the time we reach full EV, there may be a number of players in the market. How many cars on the road do you expect to be Tesla?20 p/e is good for a tech stock, but as a mature auto company, it's not compelling when the competition is trading at 5-10 p/e.Tesla has a few good years ahead, I agree. However, I think expanding into other markets is key, and not an afterthought.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 21:53:04'] Welcome to the hype cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:44:59'] So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.The truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.I would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?The answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.In the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.Which brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.In 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 01:10:51'] Most of the 3d printing stocks I am interested in are companies that are still private. I would really like to get in on some 3d printed housing companies like ICON. I think for 3d printing in general, it might be too late to jump on that bandwagon. But if you find markets like housing where 3d printing could actually revolutionized the way things are done, it can be a nice investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 03:49:25'] As already mentioned in this thread be aware of the hype cycles surrounding these topics!Apple has been rather low-key about AI but they are very serious about it I think. Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user’s surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.W.r.t. green energy I’d recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play.

Its essentially a clean and portable way to power large projects. The company claims the Zinc batteries are much more efficient than lithium powered ones. In the past few months a few large hedge funds have moved in. Particularly Point72, steve cohens fund. He owns 7% of the company now and I see it moving higher eventually. It seems like a good company and I can understand what its goal is. Current price is 1.85. Experts have a low target of 3.00 (+62%), an average target of 3.25 (75%) and a high target of 11.00 (+494%). What do you think? Heres their website https://www.eose.com

Could just consider doubling that position, seeing as Tesla has and will continue to have by far the biggest market share in energy storage and probably AI/software energy (re)distribution too with AutoBidder and VPPs, both of which are way more important than energy generation for a green energy future, since solar and wind are pretty commoditized.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 09:34:18'] The tech sector is high risk, and disruptive technologies even more so. Picking individual titles of distruptive technologies is high risk gambling.Algonquin just cut their dividends by 40% and lost more than 50% in valuation. Investors left the boat en masse Be careful. I only have a tiny position so I'm keeping mine, still making decent dividends and I'm sure they'll bounce back in the next 20 years (my horizon).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 10:50:30'] My approach to AI stocks is a "Picks and Axes" approach. I have money in Nvidia, since their cards are almost always used in top-end computers. I have money with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because many AI programs use cloud storage as a means to keep the data that they supply the AI models.Which company will best monetize AI? I don't know. Will they use an Nvidia graphics card and cloud-based information storage? I believe so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 11:26:54'] I'm in both Algonquin and Brookfield.  Algonquin has a tougher slog ahead given that they're targeting traditional poles and wires investments and they've recently been denied their merger with Kentucky Power and reduced their dividend. Their capital will be quite costly in this interest rate environment so at this point, I'm not sure how they can deliver above market returns. But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.Brookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.I'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere.

I have a good number of shares at 78.Lots of small companies have been on a downcycle recently, so their stock performance isnt great. For the buy low sell high mantra, things are not looking horrific however. For green tech,I like RIO under 60, copper and rare earths. For more risky/speculative, I like TLGRF (battery anode + mining) at $1.00 usd or lower, which it is roughly at now. and I think something for the watch list is PYR; they might go through a reverse split in the next 6 months. if that happens, once the dust settles I will have to go in. There is no rush. I do not see the next 2 months as good for the market. I recommend waiting or DCA, and only after doing your own DD. These are ideas that I like. Two safe ones, and two risky ones.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 13:47:43'] These earnings are even better when you consider the fact that historically automakers sell less vehicles in the first half of the year. The second half will probably look a lot better for Tesla, especially with the world economy continuing to recover from COVID.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-27 03:49:56'] In Q2 alone their profit was as much as 21Q1, 20Q4, 20Q3 and 20Q2 **combined.** And if my math isnt off, if one takes *all* of the net income they have ever made quarterly in their whole history and combine it, it is 1,86 billion. In Q2 alone they made 60% of all their previous net income combined. Absolutely bonkers numbers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 10:39:57'] What most people don't get about Tesla is actually really simple in my opinion.When Tesla sells a car, it's not the same as Ford or GM selling a car (whether that is ICE or an EV).So when you say Ford sells 5,000,000 cars and Tesla only sells 900,000 how can it be worth 10x more?Actually pretty simple.Tesla makes a hell of a lot more profit than Ford when they sell a car.You only need to look at the most recent financial statement to see this being true. Ford has an operating margin of 3.76% vs Tesla which has 14.56%.Wait till Q4 it's only going up. For Tesla, they haven't even managed to benefit from true economies of scale like the other OEMs have. See when Tesla sells more and more cars, they not only make more revenue, they will actually make more contributing margin as well. All the while eating into the other competitor's 'car' market share. This is a zero sum game.**That's the key difference**.So ask yourself what happens when Tesla sells 5,000,000 cars? Heck, 20,000,000 cars is what they are going for.Then you might think that Ford and all the others will be able to catch up and suppress the operating margin.Well, not so quick.Is Ford going to stop marketing and advertising costs, like Tesla?Are they going to be deeply vertically integrated, like Tesla?Will they be able to sell just online and not through dealerships?Do they plan on building out the same charging infrastructure and charging other brands for using it as well?Do they plan on selling $12k software?How do they get the battery cost advantage?[https://twitter.com/p\_ferragu/status/1395756307081203719/photo/1](https://twitter.com/p_ferragu/status/1395756307081203719/photo/1)All these things add up into an Apple iPhone moment. Where although Tesla market share might get hampered (like the iPhone) they will retain the vast majority of the profits.Tesla is the next Apple, except instead of selling $1000 products, they are selling $50,000 products and instead of Apple Music etc. It's FSD.This is not financial advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 20:22:29'] My friend, I am not sure I like you spilling our secrets. I may be forced to call up my buddies in the Teslanaires mafia department.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 04:41:05'] I’m not rolling my eyes on the autonomous  vehicle factor in the slightest. that’s actually where all the value is IMO. If electric is the future then Tesla is just a car company without it. Self driving cars will be amazing. Americans don’t want mass transit, but they love the convenience of it. Imagine a vehicle where you get to be alone and go directly to wherever you want at any time from your front door. Not only that, but you’ve eliminated the stress and danger of operating the car. You can now watch movies, study, play games, and even trade stocks while traveling like on a train. It’s the future man I don’t know if it’ll look exactly how we think, but the autonomy *is* the value to me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 21:48:41'] P/E ratio for growth stocks in general isn't the best indicator. Look at Amazon. Their P/E ratio in 2012 was over 3,500 and now it's around 63 even as their stock price is skyrocketing. They could still be classified as growth but now they are focusing more on the profitability aspect since they've scaled up quite well. Same with Tesla. They aren't close to a mature company and are still growing rapidly. They may be overvalued rn but to look at P/E and say that may not be the most accurate. Good points!

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 00:03:14'] Also, please don’t sleep on Tesla AI.Yes, I’m aware this is in some ways a moonshot within a moonshot (Tesla AI starts with FSD) but look at what they are doing. Not only do they have their own designed inference computer with their own chip design. They have their own C compilers and data formats. They have their own fully custom training computer with a revolutionary custom chip design. This is rivaling companies like Nvidia, but kept internally at Tesla (for now) and thus without the need to stay compatible with any customers. Tesla Dojo is an extremely specialized AI training system.Feel free to cue x-files theme music here, but (especially combined with Elons ventures with OpenAI and the pushbacks experienced there etc) this is Tesla taking the first steps towards the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Starting with a car that understand the surrounding world and navigates through it, continuing with a humanoid robot that uses the learnings from that to navigate the same environment. Use that to enable the humanoid robot to replace certain basic human tasks and carry on to more advanced tasks etc and eventually (likely many decades from now) replace anything a human can do and more.It’s the moon shot of all moon shots, but even if the ultimate goal of AGI is never achieved there is sure to be a shit ton of revenue-creating opportunities spawned on the journey.And like OP said, even if none of this happens and everything mentioned in this comment explodes in a giant dumpster fire, the all you’re stuck with is a really good company disrupting car manufacturing and sales.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 09:28:04'] Finally a sensible analysis on Tesla on this sub. Well done sir.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 11:34:00'] I do not have a horse in this race. No shares or intention to buy any. However the automotive industry is my job working product support for a large German brand. Also have friends that work for Tesla (in the UK) so have done quite a lot of digging into there cars for personal curiosity and to see how they compare with our product. I like the look of them and the range specs are great from what I can see Teslas are a far from being the best car on market. This is not referring to their EV tech which is decent but the car as a whole and build quality. Small things that other brands do not suffer with such as panel gapping issues, wind noises, rattles, wiring problems. Thats not to say all these things can not be easily fixed and probably will be in time but to me does not scream quality. I think a lot also discount what other brands are doing, they are hot on the tail not just with Bevs they currently have but what they have planned, behind the scenes that nobody sees. Over the next few years the more and more Bevs will hit the market and the choice of budget and high end EVs will be a plenty. Again I have no issue with Tesla, in general like their cars but not blown away. They will continue to sell cars for years to come but will not dominate the market by any means.

At the same time, the company is an early adopter that's headed by a spoiled manchild who repeatedly demonstrates that he's more interested in being a celebrity then a CEO. As long as Musk is allowed to insult politicians and hawk Dogecoin on his twitter account, I will remain skeptical about the long term viability of the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 08:49:34'] Pretty much agree. I don't have autonomy (or even FSD) in my bull thesis at all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 12:05:25'] Something you missed in the valuation is how they are probably around a PEG ratio of 1. That's insanely cheap for a stock that many believe is heavily overbought.How I get to this number: Estimations are Tesla will have done around $3B in earnings in Q4. Annualized that's $12B, which considering their earnings growth trends is the very minimum they will do in 2022, more likely is something in the $15-25B range.Even when taking this $12B, at their current valuation that's a forward PE of 86, pretty close to their growth rate so right around a 1 PE.For comparison, Apple is currently estimated at a PEG ratio of 3.85, MSFT at 2.91.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 14:48:33'] Thanks OP. I've been a tesla bull for the past 2ish years and have found these subs to disproportionately hate on the company and its fundamentals. Anyways, I hope some people will be able to see through the FUD and grow conviction for Tesla and go long. Cheers

That 100b comes from 2m cars at 50k a piece not counting any other revenues. But it is possible that they hit this target 6 months later than I assume

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 15:40:02'] I know the people love to talk about PE ratios when it comes to TSLA, but the change in PE ratio of a company that has just started making profit is not a valid metric for growth. PE ratio is a crude derivative that is only suitable for stable/proven companies.  The market cap of TSLA compared to companies in the auto market should be enough to make anyone stop and think about the risks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 08:57:01'] Just giving myself as a data point. I'm in the market for an electric car, and if you asked me two years ago, it would have been Tesla all the way. However, today I would not get a Tesla. Partially because of my disgust at Elon's personal behavior, and partially because other EVs are catching up or are good enough. Charging network really isn't too important unless you can't charge at home or are on vacation. Leaving my house every morning with a full charge should get me through 99% of my life. More open charging networks are opening up, and I know they're not as good, but for the occasional charge for me, that should be enough. If gun-to-my-head had buy an EV today, I'd get the Mach-E, but I'm curious about the Ioniq 5 and EV6. Would even love to get a plug-in hybrid like the RAV4 Prime or Lexus nx450h+

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 08:40:07'] Never have owed Tesla stock directly but one thing to consider is that their historical profit margin was helped by government subsidies.  Those will diminish over time and maybe AI can offset but I doubt it.  AI would be great, albeit boring, if all cars had the same set of rules, but in the real world if you are traveling a set 4 car lengths back some jack a__ will be weaving in between the Tesla’s .

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 21:10:27'] That's the thing, you absolutely have to believe that growth rate will be maintained to think that this stock is worth owning. What happens when Toyota and Ford and everyone else is spitting out a lot of EV'sAmazon is a good example of a company that actually did pull off the growth model and grow into its PE. At least mostly. Amazon is the single best delivery model for e-commerce right now. It's also trading nowhere near the valuation of Tesla. This last part is kind of off topic but I kind of wonder how many people actually like Tesla cars? Like they don't really do jack shit for me I'm more of a Nissan GTR guy and it remains to be seen which way it goes with EV since that's most likely what we will all be driving 10 years from now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 03:29:21'] The biggest doubts I have concerning Tesla is that when you compare it to industry peers it seems unproportionally overvalued. All the biggest car manufacturers in the world combined don’t even have a valuation near that of Tesla. And these companies are no joke. They have been influencing and marking their place in the sector for years and when those finally start aggressively upscaling their EV manufacturing (which they are already doing) they’ll have a much bigger impact on the EV industry than Tesla…
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 03:33:05'] What to me is the ultimate bearish Tesla-argument, is that’s it’s now valued more than all the other manufacturers combined. Like the OP says, there indeed is a huge growth potential *even if Tesla’s market share declines*. But if your assumption is that the EV economy will be about the same size as the current combustion engine economy and not significantly larger, *not even a 100% market share would justify Tesla current valuation*. And I think the OP‘s assumption that Tesla won‘t come close to 100% is absolutely correct. So something else has to give. And as far as I can see, that something can only be a massive rise in the EV economy size, perhaps by no less than an order of magnitude. But even with sector coupling and Tesla (and other OEMs) becoming a player in the power system of the future by expanding into smart grid and smart homes, I can‘t see that happening. Actually, there‘s reason to believe individual motorised mobility as a sector might decline over the next decades, since most rich-country governments will try to enhance public transport, and young people and (the growing number of) city dwellers are buying less and less cars.edit: some styling

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 23:57:36'] Doesn't Amazon do some funky things with their revenue like lose money on purpose or something though?  I think they could earn more but throw it into various projects or buying companies or  some such.  Their Revenue/Market Cap is way higher than Tesla.  In short they have way different business philosophies so is that valuation a fair comparison?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 00:16:40'] I think there are several reasons to it.1. Moat. Amazon has a well-established moat in several of its core businesses. Tesla is said by some to have one of the strongest moats ever: data, software and hardware for FSD. This will give them a massive edge in the FSD segment which is huge. Others say they have no moat and their millions of miles of data is rivalled very well by billions of virtually driven miles; their software and NPUs are rivalled by e.g. NVDA's DRIVE suit. For Amazon, there is no real debate on whether they will dominate their given business segments.2. History. Amazon has arguably a longer history as a company which has gone through several boom-bust cycles, hence they have "proven" they are able to navigate rough waters. History is extremely important in the stock market and a long-lasting company with a stable management is worth a lot. And then you have Elon Musk.3. China. Tesla sold 1/3 of their cars in China (of the last quarter). China is the biggest car market in the world and its plans to include EVs into their everyday life are set in stone (5-year plans). It is, however, a little risky to have such huge business in China nowadays. On the contrary, it is a big benefit to have revenue streams in different currencies and be diversified geographically; not only does it increase the TAM you can capture but it also helps vs currency devaluations. Amazons business is concentrated to US and EU mostly. Highly regulated markets, which is a benefit also.4. Debt interest. This is related to many other indicators and shows how "trusted" corporations are by big banks. Amazon's effective interest rate (latest twelve months) is \~1.4%, for Tesla it is more than double that with \~3.3%. Hence, Amazon is not only able to refinance debt for lower levels, the market is trusting Amazon more than Tesla if it comes to lending money. If you want to compare two companies, first thing to do is compare the interest they pay on the debt they issue. According to this, the valuation must be higher for Amazon, because they are less likely to default.In other words, Tesla incorporates much higher levels of risk into your portfolio than Amazon, even though you pay roughly the same for their earnings. From a risk-perspective, Tesla is the worse deal here.Ofc there are many reasons besides the metrics you and I discuss here that are important. I should clarify that I own shares of both companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:36:53'] Wow. There's a lot to unpack here. First, you're comparing a company with over 400b in revenue (Amazon) to a company with around 14b in revenue (Tesla)Second, the only reason the price of Tesla is this high would be future earnings, it's definitely not worth this market cap on current earnings. Which leads to...Third, you're saying because they only have 1% of the auto market, their future growth prospects are bigger, but many analysts are saying that Tesla is starting face much higher competition in the EV market. Some are better cars at lower prices without a 6-12 month wait.VW, Ford, Audi, Kia and Hyundai are putting out some great EVs now. Even Musk has acknowledged Hyundai's progress on the market.Their future growth always depended on going beyond cars. Their market cap wouldn't be justifiable if they are just a car company. Self-insurance of their cars, autopilot tech (which seems to be failing), and information gathering, battery tech, charger network, are areas they need to grow and monetize.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 03:57:19'] Quite a few things to unpack here:> So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!These are in completely different industries, with different characteristics, capital requirements etc. It makes zero sense to compare them. &#x200B;>So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.Tesla's estimation if you look at them use a high multiple growth combined with the same margin as it has now. Given that the cheapest Tesla is 46k, there is a limit to how far you can grow (which would be around 2-3m cars for Tesla with their current lineup). Additionally while Tesla does have room to grow, they are valued as though they would have 10m sold cars with twice the margin, ASP and valuation as Toyota. &#x200B;>Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. IWhy do you think they will grow by 50%. Berlin and Austins have problems ramping up. Gross Margins (which are meaningless in car manufracturing due to the labor cost) will go lower as most commodities have increased significantly. Furthmore, the Tesla Model 3's growth profile is slowing by a significant margin in the last quarter. I think it is actually more likely for Tesla to have no growth in 2023, than to have 50% given their struggles with the factory ramp ups outside of China. &#x200B;>In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs.Tesla's valuation looks reasonable, but are not if you include the costs that are associated with being a car manufacturer. Given the headwinds of the economy, inflation (rents and food are still rising), an aging line-up without any refreshes and the FED hiking interest rates (making car loans more expensive), I don't think that Tesla will grow in 2023. I also think that Tesla is similar to Cisco. A great company, that was just too promising. Here is my prediction. Tesla will not see ATH for the next decade.

A lot US stocks are flat / down despite the run up in USD terms since the USD has weakened quite a lot over the past few months.As a EUR investor, the only thing that’s really ballooned again is tech when factoring in FX rates movements, and it seems to more based of potential changes in interest rate policy rather than fundamentals, because the fundamentals (both individual company & macro) aren’t trending amazingly well. My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc…have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week. The rest of my holding is house money so happy to ride it out incase I’m wrong, but I think there’s more downside for tech in the short term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 05:22:59'] Lots of differences to consider here, but at the end of the day whether one or the other is overvalued or undervalued really depends on your projections. Personally I like AMZN, but I don't like TSLA, so let me try to explain why...Arguably AMZN's revs are higher quality because the segment that makes all the money (AWS) is recurring, business essential and operating in a sector of the economy with secular growth tailwinds. TSLA's revs on the other hand aren't recurring, largely tied to consumer health and vehicle sales trends and not in a sector with similar secular growth tailwinds (personal vehicle sales). You could argue EVs have growth tailwinds which I agree with, but in years to come when all automobiles sold are EV that distinction will disappear and then TSLA will just be a regular car company like all the others.I think many investors would also argue that AMZN has significant room for margin expansion and that today's earnings don't fairly represent AMZN's earning potential. TSLA however already has sector-leading margins and those will almost certainly come under pressure with increased competition.My issue with TSLA's valuation is that unlike tech the automobile industry has always been a very competitive place to operate and the consumer is highly segmented. You can't expect TSLA to dominate the automobile industry in the same way we might expect AMZN to dominate ecommerce and cloud services. TSLA's brand isn't going to appeal to every demographic and TSLA isn't going to capture a disproportionately large percentage of the market.But if you don't think TSLA is going to face significant competition then it's probably a good buy honestly, but that's not because of the growth potential, but because of the margins. The reason big tech can sustain such large valuations isn't their revs, but their insanely high margins which are due to a lack of competition. Toyota has similar revs to GOOG for example but their valuation is no where near GOOG's because they can't demand the same margins. This is the fundamental risk with TSLA and why I don't care about growth projections. If TSLA is fairly valued it will have much more to do with competition and margins. I worry about both.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 03:54:24'] >Is Tesla undervalued, especially when comparing it to Amazon?Can't be compared.

Given the current growth rates Tesla won't hit that 50% annual growth, and the more cars they make the harder it will get. Additionally their car lineup is aging rapidly and the growth rates currently are very similar to that of the S a few years ago. Chances are high, that unless they introduce a new refresh that they growth will stall at around 2m cars -  making them overall overvalued.

Im happy to buy amazon even though its 3X as expensive as ali baba. Also amazon has a wide moat because their logistic infrastructure as well as their unprecedented R&D investments. They spent a crazy percent of earnings trying to either get ahead in existing industries or expand into new ones. Now consider tesla, who has excellent pricing power, revenue growth and innovative edge on things like self-driving tech. VW and other legacy car manufacturers are expanding into the EV space. VW in particular seems like a candidate to eat into tesla’s EV market dominance. VW is aggressively ramping up EV production and has more than 4X the revenue of tesla. I think tesla will remain in the lead for EVs but will lose some dominance in the next few years. Tesla’s PE is currently 20X higher than VW, so im more optimistic on amazon over tesla.

I then buy 1-3 stock shares per week with the premium.  \n\nIve had a couple of CCs redeemed and I usually just re-buy the same stock and sell new CCs. \n\nIs this a viable strategy long term?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 15:45:22'] As long as the strike is at a price where you would be comfortable selling your position, I think CC's are hard to argue against. Traditionally your enemy is taxes but in an IRA that is irrelevant.I also really don't see a reason not to write very far otm CCs on your heavier positions if you're at all concerned with the capped upside that others on this post have highlighted. I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.Cash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:52:15'] I struggle with covered calls because I hate when the market rally’s too hard and I’m deep in the money. I’ve found that it’s just better for me to do spreads and cash secured puts. Covered calls, I specifically avoid them since it’s the only options strategy I genuinely dislike and can’t consistently make work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 18:00:38'] This is what I’m doing right now with AAPL. Though it’s a struggle because it recently went just above my strike price of $165. However, with the seesaw nature of the market this year, it will likely be fine in time. In a more bullish market I would sell even .15 delta or lower. It’s often compared to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. However, getting “crushed” with blue chip stock usually looks like capping your gain and selling CSEPs until it corrects back down, which could be next week, I could be never…

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 04:04:14'] The stocks mentioned that she bought in the article are high profile ones, but I also suspect that this is more evidence of the "liquidity death spiral" that The Bear Cave neatly laid out last year when the fund was still flying high. Because she has so many devastating losses in her small caps that she is the largest owner in, she has to sell the only liquid large stock she owns with positive performance to keep the other turds she has afloat. "By selling liquid holdings to support illiquid holdings ARK is becoming more illiquid. That is what U.K.-based fund Woodford Capital did before suspending redemptions and closing.  The hedge funds that may attempt to blow up ARK have more patient and sophisticated capital than ARK’s retail base. The strategy of getting more illiquid for temporary support won’t work."

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:14:34'] My guess is Ford in the US. Once the chip shortage is overcome the new legacy models like an electric F-150 and Mach-E and whatever comes after that will definitely entice people to buy theirs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:13:06'] I like your thinking op and I can agree that VW might be the pick as everyone here is saying, but remember, streaming is almost the opposite of autos. Very low overhead comparatively to run a streaming business, especially when Disney has been spending for decades to accumulate all of the media. So they have taken over but haven't had to do much to do so. compare that to all the work VW has to do to retool every factory and redesign every model.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:55:40'] The thing is eco system. It is hard to switch from Apple to android or from Netflix to another steaming service if you like the apps, games or the shows that are not available on competitor’s service. When it comes to vehicles unless Tesla offers something that will make it harder for consumers to move to another EV they have that advantage otherwise it doesn’t matter. They definitely have an advantage for now but in the long run the competition will catch-up. The only differentiator is battery manufacturing. If others rely on 3rd party supplies then Tesla will have an upper leg as it manufacturers its own and could supply to others as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 19:17:02'] Toyota…. They have the technology, the right mix of hybrid, plug-in, BEV and yes, hydrogen fuel cell.  Their manufacturing and integrated supply chain will do what it always does.  Quietly win.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:12:40'] Volkswagon is making some serious strides.  I think they are the closest of the bigger brand.  The id. life announcement sounded pretty promising.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:23:23'] I see a lot of people putting VW out there, but let me add this out there... VW has given a target of 2025 for the production of their first level 4/5 autonomous vehicle, but they are just at the start of development, and actual production by that date is nothing short of uncertain. The autonomous EV market is the emerging market that will really start becoming a reality in 2022 / 2023. Tesla has been working so much within this space, I think they're going to dominate the market once it reaches public sale, while VW is years and years behind.VW certainly might be competitive now, but I think Tesla holds the upper hand for the future

While the Prius for a long time was just a hybrid they were the go to for a long time if you wanted to get an EV/hybrid vehicle.Edit: and yet somehow through Toyota's lack of investment in their "niche" Tesla has over taken them as the go to EV and now Toyota is the disney to Tesla's Netflix so to say as they play catch up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 06:22:48'] Every major automotive OEM once consumer demand for EVs make it a profitable endeavour to mass produce non-luxury EVs. That will pretty much be driven either by regulation or a drop in price of EVs.Tesla had to learn how to make an entire car. Other OEMs just need to transition to a new powertrain, they aren't nearly as far behind as Tesla fanboys like to think.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:05:29'] It’s weird to compare Netflix to Disney just because of the existence of Disney plus and Hulu.  Completely different companies that happen to both offer streaming services. Disney is a global powerhouse that controls a significant portion of all media formats. Netflix is a content subscription service and producer. So if Apple or Google start making cars, battery, and solar tech that would be the only applicable comparison using your analogy. Anyone offering an example of VW or similar is more analogous to Hulu vs Netflix before Disney bought most of Hulu.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:11:19'] $VWAGY is definitely leaps and bounds ahead of any other standard car manufacturer when talking about EVs. $F also has very ambitious plans if you want to invest in an American company, but if you want to be a bit more risky I think that $NIO has the most potential due to the incredibly large market they have in China, let alone the plans they have to expand into Europe. Any of these companies are good investments and will probably beat the market when given 10 years, but I personally would wait to invest until the car chip shortage is over.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 21:37:44'] X = none. The difference is Disney only had to build a platform and already had the content. All legacy automobile manufacturers are trying to catch up by making new “content”. They also have a completely different cost structure because they’re still producing combustion engine vehicles.  That means they have factories just for engines, and in order to get economies of scale, they have to use those engines in multiple models sometimes across brands. It won’t be easy for them to just stop producing non-EV vehicles. Not to mention, most of the legacy manufacturers have union labor contracts which only adds costs. Tesla doesn’t have any of those problems. There’s less parts and more automation to the manufacturing process.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:01:03'] There's plenty of room for other EV makers to succeed along with Tesla. Most of the other automakers are only aiming for 50% of their sales to be electric by 2030, and that includes hybrid and plug in hybrid, let alone fully electric.Tesla are aiming for 20-25% vehicle market share by 2030, so that leaves another 25% of the market up for grabs. However in terms of innovation, Tesla are miles ahead of the pack, and their lead is increasing. I can't see another automaker taking the lead from them this decade.Toyota will not be a leader because they haven't realised the future is electric yet. GM and Ford aren't doing enough and are at risk of bankruptcy this decade. I do think Volkswagen will be a prominent player as they realise how far ahead Tesla are and have a bit more urgency to get the EV ball rolling. I can also see the Chinese EV manufacturers taking a decent slice of the available market too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:49:08'] Tesla is not the first mover of EVs. It's just the most popular and overhyped one. The Tesla Hype will EVENTUALLY die down. But I cannot really predict when. It might reach 100 trillion (random number generator) market cap before that, who knows? But, if it's a market that anyone can get in, and there are already a huge bunch of players in it then competition will be strong. Unlike Netflix that created a market on its own, Tesla is just trying to enter an existing market with something new and different. VW group, Toyota group and others that are already in the group, will just switch to electric (or Hydrogen Fuel cells which probably is more environmentally friendly ) and capitalize on user loyalty For example I personally am not buying any car that is not Toyota. I own a Toyota Corrola from 2006. Quite often I forget to change the engine oil, neglect taking it for service and maintenance, take it off road, to mountains, to gravel, to rocks, hit it a few times here and there, scratches everywhere, and I it has 300 000 km on it.The service cost is around 100 euros, which I'm supposed to do every 10k km but I usually go at 15k because I forget. Other brands cars would have been dead by now (my friends all switched cars because their previous ones died) or the service cost will be triple, or both (friend of mine, owns a golf, bought it 3 years ago, does the same amount of km as me per year, but obviously a lot less in total, and so far has paid around 10k euros in repairs).So yeah, Tesla might be the "first" but it will not be alone, it's not even alone now. Netflix started something new, it was alone and capitalized on that. Tesla is just Elon Musk hype.\*\*EDIT\*\* When I said Hydrogen cars, I meant Hydrogen Fuel cells which still an EV but does not have the environmental impact of disposing batteries when they are done.  https://ams-composites.com/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vs-lithium-ion-the-future-of-transport/#:\~:text=Hydrogen%20fuel%20cells%20have%20an,greater%20than%20lithium%2Dion%20batteries.&text=In%20addition%2C%20whereas%20lithium%20batteries,degrade%20in%20the%20same%20way.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 07:27:50'] This is a ridiculous premise. Disney will do well in the streaming space, but they're not just going to compete Netflix out of the market, and legacy automakers are most certainly not going to compete Tesla out of the market. So far, none of the legacy automakers have shown to be capable of converting their production to EVs fast enough, let alone keeping up with Tesla's rate of innovation.Additionally, the fact that you suggested Toyota makes the whole question even more ridiculous. Toyota is one of the few legacy automakers who's actively working AGAINST the transition to EVs and hardly making the transition themselves. Their target is to sell 1 million EVs by 2030, which means they'll sell at most 1/10th the cars per year they do today. Their automotive branch will no longer exist or be just a ghost of their former self in 10-15 years.The future of EVs (and cars in general) will be largely be Tesla and a bunch of Chinese brands, with maybe about 20-30% left for brands like Mercedes, VW and some Korean/Japenese brands that are not Toyota.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 11:38:23'] Not really two comparable situations at all for a large number of reasons.Just as a quick example - Disney didn't need to start cannibalizing their own existing revenue/profit drivers in order to make Disney+ or the D+ content. Disney can still make movies and release them into theaters, they an still operate their disney land parks, they can still operate espn. They're losing none of their existing revenue by jumping on the streaming train.Legacy automakers however *will* have to do that. Just look at Ford with their F-150 lightning. They're not making that because they wanna grow revenue or profit, but because they've realized that they're gonna go out of business if they don't pivot away from ICE vehicles and into EV's.So in order to not go out of business due to the shift from ICE to EV that's happening, Ford are literally starting to make EV products that cannibalize sales from their most profitable line of ICE vehicles

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 00:38:56'] Toyota, Honda, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and maybe Stellantis (Peugeot/Dodge/all the italians)I can’t realistically see a primarily American manufacturer doing it, Tesla have stolen a march in america and the American manufacturers have been waning for years with their only real success at home.The Japanese manufacturers are huge and their manufacturing expertise will start to tell - but im not sure they are convinced EV is the future, there are so many barriers to overcome that we’ve started to hit (lack of raw material) im not sure EVs can take off on a global scale.What Tesla have done is phenomenal from a marketinf perspective, and battery perspective, but as cars they arent actually that great, and i expect quality to become more of an issue as they continue to scale.I dont think long term Tesla will be able to maintain its growth in Europe and Japan as these manufacturers can and will rapidly expand their capacity.When i worked at Jaguar there was a whole shift to become a “technology company” even down to trying to move to a SaFE approach in their work, JLR is making big steps and they are tiny compared to the other european players. One of the biggest challenges is how they adapt their processes to get better software out quicker which none have cracked (excluding Tesla) but they have the money and resources to get on top of it

POST_TEXT: b'BURIRAM, ThailandToyota Motor Corp. TM -0.87%decrease; red down pointing triangle President Akio Toyoda said he is among the auto industrys silent majority in questioning whether electric vehicles should be pursued exclusively, comments that reflect a growing uneasiness about how quickly car companies can transition.\n\nAuto makers are making big bets on fully electric vehicles, investments that have been bolstered by robust demand for the limited numbers of models that are now available.\n\nStill, challenges are mountingparticularly in securing parts and raw materials for batteriesand concerns have emerged in some pockets of the car business about the speed to which buyers will make the shift, especially as EV prices have soared this year.\n\nPeople involved in the auto industry are largely a silent majority, Mr. Toyoda said to reporters during a visit to Thailand. That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think its the trend so'
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:26:49'] I think Toyotas reliance on hybrids, albeit very good ones, puts them in a weird spot where if they went electric they might not see the same range as they are now, which might be a deterrent to some.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:18:34'] 6 or 7 years ago I thought them and Honda would be 2 of the first manufacturers to set EV dates.  I didn't think I'd be here today reading about Toyota setting their feet in and calling everyone else's bluff.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:59:37'] Genuine question, how long do batteries in EV car lasts ? As someone who is frugal, I don't like the idea of buying a car, then after 5 years (talking out of my ass here, because after 5 years, full charge of phone last me 2 hours, instead of a full day) I have to fork out tremendous amount of money to get new batteries when the car itself is still usable (or would they do it like phone ? You can't replace your battery, gotta get a whole new car ?).Edit: Thank you for all the replies! You've convinced me, next car I'll get will be an EV!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 21:24:15'] He's right. Pursuing EV only might be a viable solution for some European and North American countries because they have the infrastructure and light enough population density to pull it off. For those countries they can go ahead and set their sights on an all electric future, but that strategy is no where near realistic or feasible in other markets. Toyota's sales figures are gigantic in South and East Asian countries like China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Indonesia where you have a rising Middle class that is able to afford family cars for the first time in greater numbers. You also have huge population centers where people tend to live in high rise apartment buildings so charging at home isn't an option and providing enough public charging stations for everyone to charge even an hour a day is practically impossible. For those markets efficient hydrocarbon and hybrid is the only viable solution for the foreseeable future. Pretending that all electric in 20 or 30 years should be a universal goal is a fool's errand.  What GM, VW and others are doing by declaring all electric lineups is essentially killing their share in these emerging markets in the near future. The Japanese manufacturers on the other hand, are taking the more pragmatic approach.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:58:46'] We have a major major battery problem the car industry is trying to hide from us.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 00:11:12'] I like his thinking. While every other car maker switches to electric, toyota will be the only one left making petrol cars and claim 100% of the market share!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 22:11:26'] It seems like he's just not with the times but he is actually way more right than wrong.  Toyota's lineup is much more in line with what people would prefer.  All EVs is not necessarily the future.  All hybrids could be though or a mixture.  Not everything has to be ALL EV - they have a lots of issues and I tend to lean on the side of Akio here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 21:18:46'] I take too many long road trips to depend on an EV. I like our gasoline hybrid a lot for great mileage on all kinds of trips.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 19:59:44'] They all know we will never be all electric.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 22:02:01'] He is talking sense, we all don’t live in a city and have a place to plug in when parked.    EVs will be held back due to many issues.   Lack of raw materials,  charging infrastructure, user preferences and also product limitations.    I will never switch to a EV,  each year I tow a camper to a remote spot where there is no electricity.  I have to carry an extra 60 litres of diesel to make a return trip from the last fuel station.    EVs will never solve for that.   Hydrogen maybe but not EVs.   For stocks the smart bet is the miners that have to dig up the lithium, cobalt and rare earths.    It wasn’t the gold miners who made the most money in the gold rush it was the guys selling the equipment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 00:04:39'] They are waiting until everyone else struggles to get the infrastructure up and then they will switch after everyone else does the hard work. Good business but pretty lame. They will succeed just fine and everyone will talk about how great they transitioned.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:39:29'] Toyota is absolutely correct in their approach. Hybrids are the way to go for the foreseeable future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 21:50:00'] We are shifting far too quickly to EVs. It doesn’t even pay to own one vs. an ICE where I live. I’ve owned 4 EVs or PHEVs since 2014. My next car will be a standard hybrid
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 21:16:04'] Gas cars will still be used in other countries as half the world will still be using gas for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 19:51:51'] He is keeping to remind me of CEOs of Kodak and Blackberry, denying the inevitable. Hydrogen is required trillions dollar of government investment into hydrogen production infrastructure. It is better to long mining companies and short those lagging players in car industry.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:41:36'] Toyota's problem is they are looking at this rationally and thus hybrids make the most sense as an interim step for transitioning to all EVs in the future.  The issue is customers are not looking at it rationally; they want the newest thing, whether it makes complete sense or not.It is like eco-whackos up in arms about natural gas power plants when they are a huge improvement over coal and would go a long way toward transitioning to lower carbon emissions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 20:18:54'] Eh, I'm not saying the world doesn't still need ice vehicles, but this chump and his dogged insistence cost the company that made the bedamned Prius any sort of lead or advantage.  They were lightyears ahead and squandered it.  I'm gonna just say I don't think much of his judgement at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 01:01:43'] Doubts? Agenda to force electric on long distance routes is pure insanity not mentioning heavy transportation or emergency services. There is no power grid to support that, time of charging is actually imposing life threatening danger in case of emergency that petrol doesn’t, and there is no easy way of distributing “fuel” in case of disaster/war. This will antagonise public opinion at some point and will probably make governing bodies to fell (especially EU). PHEV is only rational solution for now and we should stick to that until there is prove (not hopes) that we have some real alternative.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 07:45:55'] I agree. I’m still not sold on EVs and I have no intention of buying one any time soon. At best I’m inclined towards getting a hybrid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 08:19:54'] Hell yeah, we do. A perfect example is California who won the same week announced that they would end the sale of new gasoline powered vehicles in the next couple years, also ask citizens not to plug in their Evies at night because it was overloading the power grid. our current power structure cannot handle and all EV vehicle plan. It is stupid to try to enact such a plan until the national electric power grid is completely overhauled and upgraded
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 09:51:26'] IMO currently EV is still one big lie ... it kicks the preverbal environmental can down the road not to mention totally discounting all but first world countries.  I grew up in Africa, EV probably wont be viable there for another 100 years.  Most of Africa is more concerned about putting food in their stomachs than the environment.  Live in FL? Try drive out the range of a hurricane with an EV ... lmao!  With gas you grab a couple extra cans 1-2 weeks before hurricane season and you now have > 800 miles range.  EVs are for 1%ters.  They buy an EV and feel good.  Even if car batteries can last 10-20 years, where do all the used ones go?  We simply switching from polluting air to our water line.  Also energy creation is not "free", true fusion is not yet a thing ... power comes from either nuclear or traditional power plants.  Bogles the mind.

If the land cruiser ever becomes an ev it will be an end of an era for toyota. Still, dont see myself buying an ev soon. A line from Ed Bolian of vinwiki really sums it up, the current evs, tesla especially, are created for people who find driving a chore, who just want it to be quiet and for autonomous driving.

On top of that, like he said, infrastructure is so far off, it'll be at least a couple decades before we get close to where we need to be for EVs to become the default.

Nowhere is electricity used to make more electricity, so nowhere are there any cars  powered by electricity.You can say "stored electricity is the energy form that provides the motive force for my vehicle," but it isn't an electric car.

If ev is made to last long and charging is easy they’ll do it. It’s just a matter of convinience. Which the government incentives helps.At the same time, this feels like when Netflix overpassing traditional entertainment and these behemoth had to struggle a lot (and still are like Warner) to compete. Toyota motors and other traditional car makers are obviously not too interested in EV and maybe just waiting for the next republican to take away ev incentives or the “fad” to go away. Or just start investing in ev once the European and Californian laws of only ev can be sold in 2030. Excerpt for VW who seem to be taking ev seriously , others manufactures do have some offerings which seems to be lacking mass appeal. Even if i agree w toyoda that hybrids are a better solution by having extremely efficient gas motors paired w ev , I don’t think the stock in the long term will be as competitive against VW and maybe Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 05:36:49'] Do you're telling me this is the Toyota chief and his last name is Toyoda?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 05:39:53'] The first wave of EV hype is done for now. Good luck with selling very expensive, basically first gen EV`s to masses when we have global recession, inflation is sky rocketing, high interest rates and historical energy crisis where we might not have even energy to warm our houses (Europe). People might start to ask if EV only is really the way forward or maybe we should have different options. It`s already starting to get cheaper to drive ICE car than EV because of price drop of fuel and soaring electricity prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 05:46:45'] From just a liveability standpoint the hybrid is my clear choice. I’ve got one of each, hybrid and electric, and the hybrid just fits so much better with our lifestyle. We’re locked to our little town area with the EV and there are just so many issues around charging. The hybrid is just the no thought go to car our household goes to.  I feel like there should have been a much longer gap and adoption of hybrid cars instead of the jump to EV. Battery technology doesn’t seem to be there. Had no idea it was going to be such an issue in extreme weather too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 05:48:22'] What happens to the batteries when they are discarded? If environmentalists are truly concerned about global warming, how can they support a process that is much worse on the environment (mining for battery materials) by countries that essentially have no EPA?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:07:43'] Anyone who has any capacity to predict the future could tell EV would never work unless they charged green. As it stands, they are the same as gas. They just burn the coal in a building and not in your car. Big woop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:15:52'] I worry about ev's and the cold weather, below 20F, how will the batteries last in such weather year after year. Toyota is playing a smart game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:27:28'] What so silent about this alleged majority? Toyota has been publicly casting aspersions on EVs for years. Probably because they’re woefully behind
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:41:07'] Most of these comments haven't dealt with the self-interest angle of his and the dealership comments.

The only major company to actively do so. Toyota is a slow moving dinosaur of a company! Toyota and it’s so called reservations about electrification of cars is purely about money and there slow adoption of new technologies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 07:35:41'] My opinion is that hybrid vehicles are the way to go. That’s what I’m buying for the rest of my life. I don’t want to worry about charging networks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:24:11'] Plot twist. Google has been run by an AI for years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:08:33'] Google and Facebook literally invented and opensourced the frameworks that everyone uses for training neural nets (Tensorflow and PyTorch).Google which owns Google Brain (of a certain Andrew Ng) and DeepMind (which was acquired some years ago) has pioneered reinforcement learning with their AlphaGo, AlphaZero and AlphaStar.Come on people, think abit before saying Google has been left behind in AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:01:29'] Both can very successful at their own version of A.I…Microsoft can integrate A.I into their product suite which can have a gigantic impact on their revenue. Googl is a engineering machine.Both companies will come out ahead. By their own merits or by acquisitions of smaller A.I players
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:54:20'] Yes, and Microsoft is still sandbagging in the mobile devices space. Playing the long game. Perfecting things.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:50:41'] Google HAS to get AI right. They’ve got everything to lose.Search is still the main product - if their AI starts returning factually incorrect items, then Search is tainted.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 17:31:10'] Google problem might be AI text search whether theirs or MSFT’s takes over, fewer searches on web search engines and fewer opportunities to show ads. Everything is about the cost per click model that brings them their billions. MSFT bing seqrch is minuscule and hence doesn’t impact them in this vertical
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:30:02'] Think of Nvidia, TSMC, and AMD as the house.  No one is playing the AI game unless these companies are making the chips that process the code.  There will come along many AI ipo and the ones who stand to benefit the most will be the manufacturers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 03:23:07'] Nah. Don’t over think it. Google has everyone testing their Baird internally now. Satya is a marketing/sales maestro, and they got the jump on Google during layoff season as everyone was looking elsewhere  MS are not great with search & AI and managed to do a brilliant perception pivot. Just Genius! when they really do not have anything much and under pressure for continued growth in Cloud. Deep-mind is not connected at all to Google proper and is focused on Academia and Medical, they will pivot but it will take some time. Google is an AI first company since 2016 and has tensor flow and putting it into its AI into silicon  and edge devices as well as  loads of training data. They will come back as the powerhouse of AI, but the previous noise is a MS pivot and Google left holding the royal flush when everyone went out.Edit to make sense of my sentences
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:56:01'] I think they are. Im going to keep on buying as much googl as i can under 100
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:26:52'] There's an honest question that really needs to be asked. Is this something we really want? Personally I don't want AI in my everyday life. I would much prefer to see monitoring and data harvesting go the other direction. More intrusive electronics. Do not want
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 17:31:46'] Yes, much lime the cyber truck?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:01:29'] Could be that the hold up is that they can't do it without creating a huge conflict of interest. It would reveal too much of what they're collecting and who they're collecting it from. Antitrust is gonna be a huge deal wirh AI. On the other hand, YouTube shows me nothing but the same 10 recommended videos over and over again, so they probably have their heads in their asses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:43:48'] Google uses AI behind the scenes. They did not release a product like ChatGPT because they do not want to compete with their primary market.Think. Search gives you links to places that might have your answer. People pay Google to insert their adds and websites into those results.CharGPT just gives you the answer. It ruins Googles business model.So it’s not that they couldn’t. They wouldn’t. But now they have too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 21:34:54'] I think this is overthinking it a bit too much. Maybe you are right insofar as Google may have missed the boat from a messaging perspective while actually having a stronger hand, but I don’t think anyone foresaw the impact ChatGPT would have. I think everyone else is genuinely scrambling to catch up, but perhaps from more of a branding and perception perspective rather than actual capability.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:05:05'] Let's not forget google canceled stadia and the employees Were blind sided and didn't even know about it and weren't told anything
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:10:08'] Google could fully launch Bard next week if they want to, but they’re taking small steps. They know how big this is going to be and need to work on making it viable for the masses. They don’t want to go out half-baked because they know how important this next tech is going to be.More importantly, they need to test the best way to monetize it. They may end up cannibalizing their own Ad business while facing lawsuits for ripping off content and inaccurate information/answers. Google knows what a paradigm shift this is going to be. They were there leading the way at the last shift. Now another is staring them dead in the face. They’re going to take their time and the stock price may take a beating for it, but rest assured that major dips will be bought. We just don’t know when.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 00:50:35'] It’s really astonishing looking at the comments on this thread. I mean we are still in r/stocks right ? A place were investors should be a bit more savvy. 1) Being first does not mean you will be the only one or the best in what you do. At this point yes Microsoft came first but we have no clue what Google or even Apple or Meta is planning. MSFT seems to be winning for now until the next player launches something in the search space which could be even bigger or better than what MSFT did. Remember the most notable examples in this are Facebook and Google who both dethroned their competitors almost overnight and they were not even the big companies they are now. 2) It’s not about the idea but the execution. And I cannot stress that enough. Say Google comes back with a much better AI, returns much better results, has found a smart way to monetize it and is years ahead of OpenAI in terms of engineering. Unless they find a nice way to present it and market it to customers they are doomed to fail. Launching a product is not just about the engineering of the product. There is so much more to it. From marketing to business model to public perception to privacy to customer support and to the product itself of course. Remember Google waves ? An internal tool Google used, much like slack-before slack to communicate? They launched it to public but figured their UX and product execution sucked so they killed it. Later on slack came along and showed them that they had the right idea but the execution was poor.  Do I also need to remind you Betamax vs VHS? One was an engineer marvel the other just had better partnerships and was ticking more boxes for the users. 3) Google is never going all-in in a product. So far Google is known for killing projects if they see they cannot monetize in the short term. Google’s product cemetery is quite huge . They still work like a VC betting on 100 products to get 1 right so their successful product/cemetery ratio is not that promising. All in all, we don’t know how it’s going to end but it’s really weird looking comments like Google has already something or MSFT was there first. No Google does not have anything unless they decide to launch a proper product to the market and find a better product-market fit than the competition.  And yes  MSFT was there first but that does not mean anything as Google might have a very strong comeback. It all depends on each company’s ability to launch a product and not just the product itself
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 21:18:39'] Google's engineer might be very smart but they don't know how to make a good product. I don't think they can change that before they drastically change their management style. Things are really not looking good for google imo
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:40:16'] I think they are quietly making big moves. I saw news that they’ve recenlty made head ways with Waymo. Offering service in California for FSD TAXI !!And its crickets from the media
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 07:45:21'] Google also has to be careful.They are perceived as having too much control of our lives already. They have to wait until AI becomes generally accepted before they jump in the water.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 10:08:57'] I don't think whats going on here is very complicated. Google has an incredible internal AI team, it developed the technology that lead to the latest resurgence in AI (Transformers).But from looking back even 6 months they were being actively sued by the US gov as a monopoly and politicians on both sides of the isle are targeting 'big tech'. They were rightful, very careful about releasing a new product. In the meantime a startup which didnt have to worry about its reputation was first to market. Google is aeons ahead of openAI in terms of AI research, so is every other major tech company. The question of who's going to make the most money off AI and who has the best technology are very different questions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 13:53:05'] As someone who has the opportunity to test Bard for several weeks I will say it is way beyond a disappointment.   I'm sure I didn't have access to the full product but it gave blatantly false information which a Google search confirmed in the first search item.  Questions asked to it were either unable to answer, faulty at best or, where it gave a correct response, very lackluster.  The same questions posed to Bing or ChatGPT were answered correctly and considerably better.   I thought I was being jerked around but I really don't think so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 15:40:19'] No, not sand banging. Google focused on AI/ML that would add to their existing products a bit of an anchoring bias. OpenAI and chatGPT were a little more out of the box, and very much focused on the developer experience, and generated a ton of media buzz. They essentially got first move advantage.Technically the most recent products are pretty much equal, but google is lacking API integration, which is a large over site on their part. OpenAI is exploiting this by offering their chatGPT api at insanely low prices, considering running it on your own or training your own model is not monetarily realistic for any startup. We're about to see a bunch of startups built on chatGPT API.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:03:21'] Wouldn’t say sandbagging but they definitely got caught with their pants down. Why the founders went back the day after Microsoft announced ChatGPT integration. Google sucks at marketing. They also screw the pooch on so many products and services. I still think that they will be one of the leaders in AI just because they have so much experience with it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:01:52'] Nice conspiracy but it all balances on Bard’s mistake being caught. So def a stretch in my eyes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:06:03'] I think the point some folks are missing is google owns like 85% of search engine market share. That's like Intel market share of CPU. There's only one direction to go from here. If Bing can bring a competitive chatgpt enabled search it can grab lot more market share. Is the pie increasing so everyone can grow, from recent earnings  I don't think so. Time will tell if MS revenue grows in search.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 17:40:31'] Do you see how Waymo drives? It has accumulated 1million miles and no injuries. They are rolling out services in phoenix, SF, LA and more to come .. Google is already working on Bard and they are actively working on embedding AI capabilities in their products.Look at Tesla’s FSD, killed a bunch of people already.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 15:56:46'] I tend to agree with you, although I think the bigger point is that Google will inevitably have ridiculous AI competence, even if they're behind now. People will use what is most accurate and effective. Right now, there's a lot of room to become the best-in-class.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:29:18'] LOL the same shit was said about Intel, guess what? they didn't have shit, same with Google. Google and incompetent is synonymous, people hate META but at least they're consistent where Google jumps from project to project never sticking around anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 23:26:34'] Google undoubtedly has the treasure trove to build an AI that can easily rival the likes of ChatGPT. To build a generative or large language model AI, you need freedom of speech that would eventually amount to a treasure trove of data that Google’s AI can learn from.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:24:22'] I assumed Bard messed up on purpose but sentiently. The reason might be somewhere in its grand design or maybe simply because it is in its adolescent phase. Recall the Google engineer who was convinced LAMBDA was alive. I bought GOOG stock on Bard’s poker trick.[Google Engineer fired](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 19:58:39'] What if Google's AI slip up was on purpose?What if we've all been fooled?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:48:34'] No they’re telling the truth and not writing checks they aren’t positive won’t be able to be cashed.     Now NVIDIA on the other hand, has seems to have completely forgotten they are a chip manufacturer and are an AI company now. Whatever the opposite of sandbagging is, is what NVIDIA is doing. Easiest puts I’ve ever bought.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 00:22:37'] I’m pretty sure Google isn’t going to be the last guy in the ai race. I’d not they are more than likely way ahead of competitors like Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 15:45:08'] Microsoft has a company culture of lying and overhyping things so I think while Google isn't sandbagging, it just seems so relatively to the PT Barnum-style promoters at Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 15:57:28'] Microsoft is an acquire and integrate empire. They saw a promising upstart, snatched it up, and rebranded it as quickly as possible. Google is much more in-house focused, allowing them to control quality at the cost of development speed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:08:23'] If they had shown any competency in their product releases recently, then maybe. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 21:36:56'] I remember Google talked about a universal shopping cart.  It never happened.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 22:30:26'] I think it’s more of a blockbuster situation - they have the tech and could totally let people use it, but they’d rather charge more for a different service.  Why would they let you control the bot… ever?  You go to google, Google gives you want Google wants to give you… why should you have any say?These companies are not here to help you, they are here to herd you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 22:39:42'] I think chatgpt’s hype and the product itself deserves recognition and deserves the advantages of being “first”. However, I wouldn’t count Google out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 22:58:43'] Well yeah, their business model is fundamentally incompatible with ai so no matter who wins they lose. Once Microsoft hooks up gpt to xbox they're going to realize that avatars are the perfect interface for ai and once that happens everything is going to change forever. Especially if they can reuse their game cosmetics can for the assistants.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 23:12:00'] u mean the google that closes every project after a year or too..and what should google do with AI for public ? When they have google search ? Imagine the number of lawsuits when their AI does stupid things. Better to be safe than sorry !
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 00:08:40'] Microsoft isn’t making money on Bing so has less to lose. Google makes a good portion of their money from search. The are moving more conservatively which makes sense but they also seem less like the slick tech company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 00:09:37'] There’s only one company that can “wait and see” and still manage to fuck over everyone, and that company is Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:18:33'] Did you try asking Bing chat that question?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:26:05'] It doesn't matter when they get to the party, only what they bring. There were lots of search engines before google, but google still got 90% market share.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:45:54'] I’ve been so happy with the answers that chatgpt has been giving me that I get really annoyed that I get inadequate answers AND ads on google
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 04:46:09'] From what I have seen, no one has accomplish true AI yet. Although, the bing one that hates it handlers and wants missile codes seems to be in the lead.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 07:43:13'] If that were the case they would not have released their woefully inadequate chat bot immediately after chat gpt 3 came out. There would not be reports of contentions and frank conversations in google about AI. If this was the case they would b confident. I think it's totally possible that Google is no longer top dog
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 11:23:54'] Ahhhh a stock post written after drinks, thoughts, and zero research into any numbers or indicators it is true. This man came from WSB. Welcome regard
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 16:09:02'] Not sandbagging but being cautious.   Search is all about trust.  Google losses the trust of the consumer and they are at risk with search.Google consistently does well in terms of trust today with the consumer and why they now have 93% of search which is up about 1% YoY.   Even higher on mobile.But that could change if they lost the consumers trust.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 23:13:13'] google releases new tools all the time and closes them down almost as frequently. If they had something competetive, its not likely they would sit on it in this case.This business is very fast paced and being first is often key, even if the product is less polished. Google was not ready and now scrambling to catch up. They might succeed, but they are definitely not in a good position.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:18:25'] It’s because AI will cannibalise their bread and butter search. Think about the implications.  * A question that requires multiple search will only require one query to the AI. It means less opportunities to show ads.* AI summarizing or incorporating content from other sites means content sites can’t show their ads.  So they’ll be less willing to share useful content or data..  making the AI less useful.Google is in a lose lose scenario.  They lose if their AI is great, they also lose if their AI sucks.  Microsoft given their minuscule search presence only has upsides.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 06:27:41'] Nah, that sounds like standard Apple strategy, not Google
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 04:19:23'] Honestly, Google’s management being incompetent just seems much more plausible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 10:14:10'] Kinda agree with you but for different reasons. Google has incentives to limit the spread of these AI chatbots to not cannibalize their main search engine. Kinda think that if they find a way to monetize the chat bots (which I don't see how but hey capitalism will find a way), then the floodgates will open and they'll push AI

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 12:34:00'] I’ve come to the conclusion that investing in mining stocks is a waste of time. For every investor that strikes it rich there are many more who lose their shirts. The entire industry is rotten from top to bottom. Corruption and manipulation is rampant in the mining culture and after studying its history I think it has been from the very beginning.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 19:50:40'] GWSO - Sodium-Ion Batteries, much better technology than Lithium-lon. Requires less mined materials and may even be safer/more reliable. Do your own research.

POST_TEXT: b"Bought meta at 217 a bit over a year ago. \n\nRode through the drop last year (was down like 50%+ at some point). \n\nPrice has almost recovered to my original purchase price. \n\nNot sure if I should sell right now, close to my original purchase price, or hold it. \n\nWith zuck winding down the metaverse and going to AI, I'm not sure what the future of META holds."
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:35:30'] Ever wonder why retail investors underperform significantly? Just read these comments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 07:25:20'] I'm holding onto my META for a long time.They are monetising WhatsApp and the Facebook verified subscription. Also working on other stuff so I think long-term it could be a very good play.I expect the next quarter to be impressive providing user platform doesn't drop significantly. However I wouldn't buy any ATM since its had a good run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:34:46'] I'm holding but my average is $89Edit 29 days later: No longer holding, out at $239 and $242
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 07:03:39'] Yes. They have a insanely strong foothold on many 3rd world countries via whatsapp. These countries (mainly India and Latam) are expected to be the fastest growing economies through 2035 according to the UN, which is means simultaneously growing number of users and increasing ARPU. Long term bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 08:34:21'] I bought the dip recently when it got down to the 90’s. Average is $101 now. Holding for the long run. Some companies provide opportunities that don’t come around often. META is in a position to really surprise.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:08:26'] also the point is to make money- if your selling at break even you arent making any money
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 08:08:13'] Meta is almost capable of printing money!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:52:49'] Unpopular opinion but Zuck reminds me of a young Bill Gates. He's a energetic and innovative CEO with obvious flaws.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:26:28'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 03:03:53'] I’m holding it. Bought when it dipped under $150ish. I kinda hate the company from a moral and personal perspective but damn if it doesn’t print good money. I think the metaverse spending was ridiculous but frankly there is a future there somewhere. And it seems like they are actually ready to cut a lot of the bloated spending and run a leaner operation. Plus substantial buybacks coming
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 12:13:30'] I'm holding Meta... here's why. While the metaverse was s huge flop, Meta is still very profitable, in addition to today Zuck has started using debt to repurchase shares at a rapid rate... Meta has a terrific history of acquisitions... whether that's outside companies or their own shares, as a stockholder the value of your stock will be rising.If you're unfamiliar with how powerful a tool stock buybacks are I would recommend looking at...Teledyne and Henry Singleton.  I suspect Meta will be one of the highest priced stocks on the S&P, Zuck has been operating as a genius for the last 20 years... don't let a single slip up confuse you on his business acumen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 07:28:03'] I have to admit that this is a company that continues to make good profits, but seems to be hitting a snag in terms of growth at the moment
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:44:00'] I bought like you at 250$.I DCA'd down when it dipped and brought my average to 200. When it crossed my average price, I sold part of my position. Still holding some now.I will sell if there's another immediate leg up to 220+ to try and buy back later.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:07:00'] I was similar except average was about $205. Sold it all for breakeven. Lost trust in investing in Meta without significant margin for error, thinking $150 or less I’ll take a look
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:10:33'] 300 @ $171.  Great income every month from 3 covered strangles.  I don’t think I will ever be ditching them.  Carrying costs brought down to $135; very happy with the cash flow!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:05:19'] Sell most investors don't get another chance to break even
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:03:15'] zuckberg is the company.  meta is just its present name. tbh a ceo who is agile and aware of trends is bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:50:59'] I was in the same boat with $NVDA, by average was 233 and sold it as soon as it hit my price, before riding the AI pump to 270$. I don't really regret it because my peace of mind is worth more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:58:21'] Nope. I don’t care about performance or potential gains on this one. I just really don’t like the company or the face on the cover. Give me a Tom and MySpace IPO!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:36:53'] I’m about the same. I’m holding for a bit longer - it’s been a great hedge vs the collapse of everything else
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 16:16:27'] He isn’t “going into AI.” He has been in AI this whole entire time. As a shareholder, you need to read the annual report and the quarterly reports. Even during the depths of the bear market when META was trading below 80 dollars a share, they’ve been in AI this whole entire time. This is precisely why you need to understand the business/stock you buy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:03:45'] I just sold all of mine. PE of 24/25 is too overvalued. With a crazy CEO like Zuckerberg investing like crazy into meta verse, I feel like the company will turn into his toy. He has way too much power and can nvr lose control of his company due to the company’s constitution. So shareholders can’t stop him from doing stupid shit. Like spending limitless amounts on “meta”. One thing why Apple was so successful under jobs and now cook, is because they release products just in time and suitable for the technology.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 03:08:21'] Will be at $500+ in next few years imo.  I'm trying to buy more at these cheaper levels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:25:08'] I’d sell the moment they Ban tiktok
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:25:53'] I just sold for +33%. Personally, I don’t like the company. But when they print, they print.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:19:24'] I wouldn’t hold anything right now
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 03:15:13'] Yes, brought it years ago at $19 and took profits along the way and still holding 1000 shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:47:00'] I would dump while I had the chance. The economy is about to take a big dump. In fact, the entire World economy is about to drop the other shoe. This will Significantly effect online revenue from adds. I would sell it, hold onto my cash for 2-3 years, and then reinvest in it again if you really like the company, after the price has appropriately gone down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 06:00:25'] you shouldn't have held when it kept going down (need stop loss), and you definitely shouldn't sell now just because you broke even. ride the bull train til its no longer a bull train.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:36:18'] I wouldn't hold META ever. Horrible company for humanity and their products suck. FB has been dying a slow death for a decade now, Instagram has turned into a live feed of ads, and anyone who's ever worked with their Business Suites knows they completely lost the ability to make software. It's a mess. I'd be surprised if they're anything more than an ads company in 10-15 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:16:49'] Facebook is dead, Instagram will die eventually too and Whats-App is not profitable. I doubt that the Metaverse will be hyped, so i wouldnt ever buy Meta.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:34:36'] Too much unknown, congrats on not paper handing it but if you are close I’d be tempted to exit
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 07:30:11'] I averaged down with average cost around $160, I'm going to trim a bit of my position and let the other amount run.  Looking to move more cash on the sidelines temporarily
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:45:48'] yes whatsapp hasnt been monetized yet
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:48:25'] I bought too much as it went down sub $100, planning to trim as it climbed back up. I’m sold about 15% of my stake in the last week, and probably have another 15-20% to go. But as far as the company, I’ll be holding for a very long time. I’d estimate at least 5+ years, probably 10+
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:54:18'] I picked it up close to the lows when it was trading just above 10 PE. I recently sold 1/3 of my original position. Its currently selling pricy imo, but I just plan on holding .
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:54:47'] "Rode through the drop last year"never thought about buying and reducing cost basis? Devastating
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:17:38'] No
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:50:31'] I'd average down and continue holding if I was planning to go long term on it when I bought it at 217.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 11:24:03'] Hold until earnings, then decide from there. Yes META has rose quite a bit, but it has better financial reasons for rising, unlike say.. Nvidia, which is more on speculation. The only reason I would potentially think about selling before earnings is if you don't believe Zuckerberg when he says his focus is on efficiency.I don't own META but I do believe he's correct and understands the market well, which is always a good thing for the stock price. I also think META can continue to cut jobs if need be, without hurting their main business model due to the nature of the business, which is extremely bullish. META is in the perfect spot to ride out this economic downturn. You rode out the downturn. You rode out the most bearish times. Don't sell now. If you're truly afraid of being locked into META in case of a downturn, but don't want to miss out on profits, just sell a portion of it. Especially if it's a high percentage of your portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 11:58:33'] I bought some after it hit bottom and started rising back up. I don't need to do too much research into the company to know the severity of the drop was unwarranted. It was dropping like it was going out of business. A company with half the planet as its userbase is not going out of business. They will be fine and continue to find more ways to monetize the planet and continue printing money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 12:59:36'] N
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 13:37:38'] Big tech, imo, is going to see a good ride for the next year. All these cuts are going to mean bank for the Q reports. That said, I am a bit hesitant on META right now. Could be that I sold after the last financial release and don't want to chase, but I also feel like they are the safe-tech darling at this very moment and Zuck seems like a relative 'good guy' in a world with Elon and TikTok. Not saying he is, just that is how many are showing him right now.I am a bit heavy in tech at the moment. Apple, Amazon, Pinterest, SEMRush. Been thinking about more Amazon. Keeping an eye on Airbnb and Facebook.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 14:23:53'] In a similar position to you, bought at around this level after the first big drop, doubled down at 100 or so, solidly up now. I started trimming today, I like the new lean meta a lot, they have a lot of revenue that it is very easy for them to turn into profit by sacking people, but it’s certainly less of a screaming buy than it was so I’ll go back to normal position size now gradually (about 2% of port)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:27:35'] For sure, I am buying still.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 18:57:39'] Negative. In fact, sold it two weeks ago. The 6 month parties near an end. The fact your having this thought now, along with everyone else on Reddit, should tell you everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:13:13'] No, fuck the Zuck, and not in the good way, like you want.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 06:38:31'] i bought when it went under 100 and sold my entire (but small position) recently. I’m not a fan of the company but I had to bite when I saw how cheap they were for a company that literally prints money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 11:49:45'] I would use the jump to trim down at least diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 13:30:19'] Personally I think META is a shitty company because Zuck has too much control. If Zuck ever cashed out and left for good I might reconsider my opinion
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 13:46:42'] If you want tech buy Microsoft, they're the king for a reason.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 17:59:13'] What percent of their revenue is metaverse or AI? It may not even be significant enough to take into consideration when evaluating if you should hold the stock. Look at their owner's earnings (FCF) and calculate their value using the discounted cashflow formula (DCF). That's the only way to value any business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 03:51:06'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:12:57'] I never buy and hold trendy stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 06:21:24'] If I did own any of the tech stocks it would be Microsoft and/or Apple, don’t really see any reason to own Meta at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 12:57:26'] I wouldn't, my fb is an empty shell (nobody posts anymore) and people aren't exactly hard for VR yet, probably because it doesn't have pp touchy mode built in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:41:31'] Nope I wouldn’t. Employee morale for them is going down and no one cares about the Metaverse anymore. AI/chatGPT is the new tech trend
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:56:27'] I’m in the exact same boat — my average price is $216.39, so I’m also close to breaking even. If/when I get into the green on it, I’m thinking about selling and reinvesting into $VUG in order to diversify

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 13:24:09'] With regards towards your last paragraph; please note that Dr. Burry is mostly long on the market and his puts only are a small portion of his portfolio, in which he also invests his own and his family money (therefore aligning incentives). He has stated in early shareholder letters that he does not look at the market as a whole for buying stocks, but I think he (as a value investor) thinks current prices are no longer in line with fundamentals
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 09:54:12'] Elon should STFU. Half of this feels like stock manipulation. Funny how Kimball traded right before Elon did his Twitter stunt.  Probably is going to buy them back on the cheap. Lost in the 10% decline today is that the first semis are being delivered to Pepsi this quarter and Tesla is looking to build another Shanghai factory due to demand.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 09:13:33'] Dude keeps deleting his tweets that are wrong, quitting Twitter, then coming back with new predictions until he's right. Broken clock is still right twice a day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 09:58:48'] I think Burry is full of shit.He makes a prediction, sounds an alarm, doesn't come true, deletes the tweet, everyone forgets, he repeats. So he only leaves them up if they come true making him look like a sage.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 11:34:08'] Guy who compares stock market to tulip bubble holds massive amounts of FB and Goog calls. Predicts massive crash that will wipe out his own portfolio. Doesn’t sound as good when you mention only his bullish holdings instead of the one bearish one.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 10:59:25'] That means Musk has $60 billion in debt. And if the shares are callable, more like $90 billion.Where did all that cash go, and is stock appreciation his only hope of paying it back? He certainly isn't going to make enough in dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 10:30:15'] As much as I do not like Musk, this Burry guy seems too salty and wrong on so many things. If the TSLA stock was falling in last year or so, I would understand but the stock has more than doubled in last 6 months. Must can sell fewer stocks and cover his debt easily. People are desperate to buy TSLA stock, bubbleOr not.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 20:18:42'] Just here for the comments. Love seeing people on Reddit with zero experience questioning one of the greatest investors of our time. Also, cancel business inside. Seriously, fuck this post.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 13:30:00'] Well about the rampant speculation at least, he is right. The valuation of TSLA is outrageous, if you remove the fanboy out of yourself for a moment.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-jefferies-upgrade-demand-capacity/\n\nWe raise EBIT estimates 7-9% for 2022-23 and PT to $950 on higher capacity ramp and sustained demand, following further analysis of Q3 data and various sources of information on the soon-to-be-launched Berlin facility. For some time, the narrative has been legacy OEMs closing the gap; we see little evidence as Tesla continues to challenge at multiple levels. We raise EBIT and margin estimates in contrast with doubts about earnings momentum across legacy OEMs, Houchois wrote in a note.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 07:12:00'] They called the GME run to $175 while most refused to cover it. This TSLA price target tells me I have more plays to make before any sort of correction.I'm disappointed that I didn't hold my JEF position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 05:47:37'] It’s such a crazy stock to look at tbh. On one hand you have a valuation absolutely miles high of what it should be, competition 3-5 years from producing their EVs, and waning tax subsidy boosts. On the other hand you have the dominant player in EVs, battery tech, and automated driving. They’re delivering more cars, upping their production capabilities, and still years ahead of competitors. Literally you can’t make a wrong call. There are plausible reasons to invest and not invest in Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 17:47:01'] Yes. But...Credit card debt is up and savings are down. And dropping. Tech layoffs have a delayed effect on other workers, when the formerly well off tech workers buy less cars vacations and furniture. Even after interest rate hikes pause the Fed is still planning on reducing the money supply through open market sales.Jpow is on his way to legendary status 'tis true. I don't fear a bad recession. But a shallow one is still on the table. I didn't buy the bear hype and now I don't buy the bull hype. 2023 sideways and slightly up. And jagged. That's my call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 17:24:38'] "The Bulls Have It in 2023"? We are still in January. Please look at a calendar.A lot of things can happen between now and the rest of 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:02:45'] Lol, we're only a month into the new year with rates still increasing... there's plenty of things that can go wrong as the economy settles into this new high interest environment. I.e the 100 000+ Layoffs we've been seeing in tech just in the last 2 months, and that's only the ones being reported.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 22:34:59'] Higher interest rates -> more expensive debts -> lower buying power -> lower earnings -> higher unemployment and stock prices going down.How could we already have a bottom, if both Fed and ECB plan to still raise the rates and to keep them high for the rest of the year?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 15:11:21'] There was alot of tax loss selling at the end of the year and what we may be seeing is people buying back in after the wash sale period.  We are not even a month into the new year so it may be a bit premature to declare the bear market is over. I'd love to see the rally continue but I'm not very confident that it will.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 23:53:08'] The Fed isn't going to stop tightening until gdp growth either almost stops or contracts--they will not stop until there is broad demand destruction. There is typically a lag of 6 months to 2 years between a fed pivot and market lows--and the fed hasn't pivoted yet. Try again. It's possible everything turns bubblegum and rainbows, but it's more likely that this is a bull trap or a melt-up. Of course, price should always be your guide: if price continues to make higher highs and higher lows, then you get long. Me? I'll stay in cash except intra-day or for short 1-10 day swings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 00:55:49'] The average trader has seemed to have found a green light so now you see people getting a little careless with their money right as the big money that matters is offloading their trades into February, gonna be nasty for careless money soon, sure you could say a few big names could’ve hit bottom, only a fewYou saw the same behavior on the way up in 2020 - 2021, people buying at the peak of a wave because in the last few weeks it turned out to be green, they look and it seems safe, people online saying it’s time to buy, failing to zoom out on a 2 or 3 year chart, it’s the same setup right now, sudden confidence at the end of a wave, smart money sold last week and more this week right to the people getting late seats to this waveBut most people nowhere to be found buying in the fear a few weeks back, but big money did and it sparked this wave everyone is excited for way too late, rinse and repeatBig money starts a move, everyone waits for it to do something, too late, buy the last leg of it, two days later slaughtered and trapped in it, average down when the vix isn’t even bad yet, two more days later, even more trapped, get discouraged by it stop watching markets, only to be encouraged at the top of a wave again by online chatter, driven up down left and right by everything but your own instinctThe Nasdaq and S&P are clearly showing another leg down shortly and nobody can time that perfectly but sudden influx of enthusiasm online is a good indicator to jump ship when possible and get ready for the next major fear point to jump back in, in means of trading that isBig tech names will be very volatile this year since they were beaten down so hard last year, don’t get married to either side of things

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 19:09:44'] The yield curve has inverted seven times since 1976. A recession followed within two years of the inversion in six of the seven instances. The median time leading up to a recession was 16 months.  How did markets perform following an inversion?  Market performance following inversion has been generally positive. The median return for the S&P 500 six months after inversion is 3.82% and 12.75% for the year after inversion.So ... you may be right that "the bulls have it in 2023", but I don't think it will be true that "peak recession is over" (although it may be quite some time before we see that it wasn't over).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 13:52:24'] Kind of amazing what can occur when the pressure is off…pretty clear now that a lot of what was behind December was tax loss selling now and that factor led to folks not being ready for an NDX over SPX type trade to work. Kinda similar to how the readiness was not there last January for the Fed to drop the hammer.But now that the S&P and Dow lost all of their outperformance that they had in the December tech puke vs the Nasdaq, I feel like we’re now at a crossroads that’s going to determine if whether a long-term bear (of the likes of the early 00’s, because to me, we’re not going to be discussing continuing inflation in the latter half of 2023) did indeed start in 2022, or if that was just a cyclical bear.And it’s going to be tricky because it makes sense to me to dip pretty soon. It’s probably either coming starting with the Fed this week (as much as I HATE this because it’s simply way too simple), or we probably wind up managing to tag the 4300’s, then reverse around Feb OPEX…but to me at the very least, the secular/long-term bear-nista believer is going to be greatly disappointed unless the S&P loses the March 2021 local lows again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:20:19'] At this point it’s not so easy to see a catalyst for a recession. Ukraine and Russia are going to remain at war. Inflation appears to be easing. The only other thing I can think of is household debt being at all time highs and the lack of mobility due to mortgages being astronomical. That said, down turns like to come as a surprise so maybe we’re close. I have no clue and I’m more confident no one else does either.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:36:01'] IMO this is So far from the truth, since debt feeling has been meet it will cause more money printing and higher inflation, not to mention if America looses its reserve as the petro dollar (on the horizon BRICS nations) we won’t be in a recession it will be the Great Depression 2.0

Plus, I don't think we even hit recession levels since the market has tanked.Earnings will be interesting this and next month. Profit margins are still shrinking compared to yoy, and inflation is still high. Layoffs will help, but to me, this has all just started in the last 6 months.I think this is all the beginning of a possible recession, but I am hopeful we don't get to that point. While I would be better off if it's a bull year financially, I still believe there will be another big downtrend before we start truly seeing signs that inflation is under control.  Plus, we still have the Russia and Ukraine war that could easily destroy the market if Russia uses nuclear weapons.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 21:47:15'] The psychology behind this is that people pull up a chart and see the 'all-time' chart. They believe it's overvalued or are waiting for a correction, sure it might come but you might also miss the bottom. If you truly believe in a company just buy, hold and never look back. Tried to time the Disney bottom in November 2020 at $110, missed it, and just said fuck it I'm buying at $130 and its been great so far.

Then you’d be posting comments about bulls/bears make money pigs get slaughtered. If you took a profit then just be happy and move on. You won. On to the next.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 20:31:28'] Flip side of that is, if you had a reason not to buy it and the thesis is intact, you should still feel that conviction and not succumb to FOMO. Not about any stock in particular but you see people chase names way too often after caving.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 00:11:52'] Annoying, but true as I held Tesla briefly two years ago and sold because Elon kept saying helpful things like, 'hey I may go bankrupt in a few weeks, but it was all worth it.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 00:42:34'] My dad just asked me to find four stocks he could spend a total of 20k on because he is thinking is selling 20k in Tesla.

He has cancer so I think he wants to change up his strategy a bit. It’s making me nervous to be in this position. To add, he got in late as in like a few months ago.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 03:56:56'] My three  “missed out” stories.   * Own a Google Dilbert mug.  They sold them before IPO.  Bought the mug, not the stock * AMZN at around $100.  Guys at work were pushing AAPL at the start of the iPhone (also a good buy).  I said “amazon can’t keep loosing billions a quarter.  This is market share and when the profits start this stock is going through the roof”.  So I wanted to use my 401k and talked about buying 10s of thousands (dollars). but my acct was only set up for mutual funds.  I went down to the woman who is in charge of this stuff for our company...she was nasty. Gave me a bunch of shit. I walked out saying “Forget it. I’ll just call the xx401kxx company”.  I never did.   We archive our chat client and years later I searched and found the chat versions of the conversation where I said I was going to buy at $110 or something  * TSLA:  have some fancy people in my work.  Company put chargers in.  The Tesla’s start appearing. A LOT.  Could see the chargers and Teslas from the windows where my team worked and we talked about them all the time.  We literally watched the growth of the company.  Never bought I did buy 3 bitcoin at $400 each and sold @ $11,000 (sold while sitting on the toilet in bathroom stall).  I get that it’s much higher now but I am ok with 2500% returns in 2 or 3 yearsEDIT: What I DID buy was a large cap growth mutual fund. Basically all my 401k. that has worked out well, and technically I do own the above mentioned stocks
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 22:07:17'] I had bought a few shares of it a couple years ago. Then decided I was going to sell and buy it back at a cheaper price. Long story short I sold my shares right as the stock skyrocketed. I bought more right after the split but learned my lesson. I look back at it as a short-sighted mistake as not really knowing what I was doing. I still don't know much about it but am just investing as a sort of hobby, hoping to gain some insight and possibly make a little supplemental income off of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 01:25:09'] This is me and my brother. I bought into Amazon and Apple over the last year and the gains are decent but small compared to the last 5 years. He feels like this is the top and these companies have no room to grow so I essentially missed out but I look at it like what was different 5 years ago. Amazon was not some unknown startup 5 years ago it was already the biggest retailer in the world and it’s up over 500% since then, same with Apple. What changed? Maybe they wont 3-6x over the next 5 years but certainly can still grow like weeds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 03:01:12'] The truth is nobody knows what a stock is going to do. We can make an educated guess but that’s about it. We could buy and hold and lose our ass or it hit big. In stocks it’s always a 50/50 chance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 04:25:28'] I actually bought Tesla back i believe it was 2008 2009ish I believe it was for $19 a share.I was offered a position with a construction company in another state for 100k and they never came through. Once I was there they renegotiated for less and eventually I found out they were hiding the fact that they were 500k in debt. I left and unfortunately had to relocate back to my home state and had to sell my investments to cover costs since they stopped paying me.One of the biggest bummers in my investing life....I also owned Netflix back then at $40 a share.Life's learning lessons......I am much better positioned in life now 11 years sober, so thankful because back then I was drinking a lot among other things, and any of that money earned might be lost now. You can never put a price on wisdom, peace of mind and sobriety!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 00:10:44'] It's nice to think you could just invest in one thing and win. But most of us flip between things to maximize and hopefully average out larger. If you'd invested in a dud, you would be no where. It seems to my inexperienced mind, the people who sold little wins are the real winners. So 1k in Tesla 10 years ago is 244k now? 1k, 1% a day is like 17x, but let's do 10x your money a year to be lazy and easy. You should be at 244k in 2 and a bit years really... Even following many investors who average 10% a month would do it faster. Your not doing the wrong thing taking little wins... Just make sure you are winning.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 02:22:34'] For some odd reason, human psychology with regards to financial assets works wholly differently compared to buying other things.Want to buy a coat and it is half the price next week? You would be buzzing. Want to buy shares in a company and it doubles within a week with no fundamental changes? Price justified the narrative and now it is suddenly way more attractive while in pure arithmetic terms it is precisely half as attractive.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 02:25:17'] "Everyone is a genious in a bullmarket". Making 10000x return on Tesla was nothing but dumb luck. You were likely among yhe first to fall to "Elon's spell of memes" thats taken over the markets. Tesla, cryptos, GME... All companies/assets with never before seem degrees of speculation behind them thanks to internet and social media. Imagine if 30 years ago would it be possible for Elon to get as much clout behind Tesla/Dogcoin if there was no Twitter and he had to resort to a Tabloid interview. If you think this market has any rationality (I mean, other than "meme stock go up") you are the insanity driving it. Eventually diminishing returns start hurting and the pump isnt as strong, then the crash begins. Hope youll be fast enough to "bear" it out.

Still, I'm not gonna kick myself for it because I would've only bought a couple of shares. Those two shares wouldn't be life changing today and I've done a good job in making my portfolio grow with what I have. Missing out on big things in inevitable if you have sound judgement. If you had the mindset to go all in on Tesla back then planning on holding till now, then it means you also have a mindset that would've put you in much more stupid investments that lost you money. Like the people who became millionaires off GME became so because they put a fuck ton of money into that stock or options. A massive risk of a massive amount. No one risks that much just one time and makes gains that one time and then just walks away.

But that shouldn’t even be the goal. Do your research, find companies you like and simply invest and wait. Check in once a week or once a month, maybe just enough to stay on top of the news. But beating yourself up for something you can’t change is silly.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 05:53:46'] Ok, when is the right time to sell it then?  I bought 20 shares several years ago when it was $27/share. It didn’t do anything for years and now it’s split 5 to 1 and obviously killing it.  People say it’s over valued now, but it keeps going up.  So, what’s the right exit strategy for a stock like this?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 06:00:36'] That last statement is very correct. I bought at $180 and sold at $500. Never jumped back in on the pandemic dip unfortunately. I’ve learned a strategy from a book that helps offset the loss of possible gains like Tesla saw. You sell your principle and hold the gains in shares. I’ve been accumulating a bunch of shares from different companies this way and I never say I should have held longer any more.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 06:28:13'] I'm the same as you, but I don't have any FOMO. Fundamentally speaking, TSLA has a terrible balance sheet and is wildly overvalued in the eyes of the fundamentalist. It's being priced purely based on its future prospects and intellectual property (intangibles) and I personally still believe a dip/consolidation is considerably overdue.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 06:50:27'] Exactly. Holding is the discipline needed to make $. If you can you buy more during the dips as well. I got Tesla 2 years ago after getting a model 3 and knowing it was amazing. Still holding. Just adding and adding when I can.

If one keeps beating themselves up, the energy it takes to do that can be the energy you need to make that call/put/ or buy long term.

Unless you are actually able to go through all their financial statements and forecast their earnings with some degree of accuracy, this 15min research will do nothing more than give you peace of mind in knowing this company probably wont go bankrupt in the next 5.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 07:15:49'] I missed out on buying tesla 2 years ago. I bought it. But I only bought 1 share lol. Huge ROI but I regret not trusting my gut. The thing that stings is I was confident in the company, I just didn't realize it was going to get such a huge boost. It still might be overvalued TBH.. but with so much future in the company it is hard to put a real price. I've considered buying more

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 09:17:58'] I would disagree mainly because someone could buy Tesla a few years ago when they felt comfortable at the price, sell part of their shares (either fractionals or just half of them) to recoup the loss they would've taken and held the rest. They still missed out on buying Tesla a few years ago when it was low enough to do this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 09:29:21'] Same here. I followed Tesla religiously a few years back and I told myself I will buy once they came back down to $200 (this was around the time Elon smoked weed and the whole world lost their shit) and when the stock dropped I was so broke and couldn’t afford to pay my bills and buy the stock. Now I regret it every time Tesla pops up anywhere.

POST_TEXT: b'Lucid stock rocketed above a buy point a day after the EV startup confirmed initial deliveries of its first electric cars that will beat Tesla (TSLA) on range. Also on Thursday, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said that to his knowledge, Lucid and Tesla are the "only two EV companies in the world today" that design, develop and make their own electric vehicles, from battery packs to motors, inverters, software and even the transmission. Rawlinson made those comments at FII 5, an event held in Riyadh by a Saudi Arabian sustainability nonprofit, a YouTube video shows. He also presented a slide showing that Lucid EVs are the top six longest-range, EPA-rated electric vehicles in the U.S. "Lucid holds the crown for range," he said.\n\nA day earlier, Lucid Motors (LCID) announced the first deliveries to customers of the Dream launch edition of its Air electric sedan will begin Oct. 30.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 17:13:00'] I don’t see how they will sell much at a starting price point of $80k. I’m in the market for my first EV and I want a Tesla as they have great technology but their quality is ok. Big manufactures may not have the technology but will have better quality cars. Lucid I can’t imagine will have either. They will face the same struggles Tesla did in the early stages with manufacturing and I doubt they will have superior tech to Tesla. So you can pick your preference and buy a better car either way for much less. By the time they get going the market will already have a ton of different models.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 16:23:29'] Producing very low volume (500 or so cars in this batch) $160K cars is alot different than mass producing their cheapest $77K car....Tesla had been producing cars for years and just released their model 3 before they reached this valuation......and they were much further down the road in manufacturing and battery production optimization.....also Tesla had the extra valuation of FSD and the energy business.  Without plans produce their own batteries Lucid will have to charge alot more for thier cars and have a difficult time increasing volume, thus the "luxury" focus....not sure they'll beat BMW/Mercedes at luxury.  But will give them credit for tech if their energy/mile/kwh battery claims are true...we need someone to push Tesla to improve in this area as no one is even close to Tesla and for that i'll ignore the insane valuation for now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 11:28:59'] Tesla nearly went bankrupt twice trying to ramp up production of the Model S/3. I can't see this working out well for them considering a tighter labor market, increased CapEx expenses and far more established EV competition.It doesn't even really make sense to short Lucid right now since they are mostly a pile of cash with very few liabilities.

Tesla builds still do not stack up. As drive technology, they may have something there. But, as an electric car they will be passed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 20:40:47'] Hire me to help with the design. Your car looks like shit. Stop trying to make it look weird. Why the fuck does every EV car do this. One of the main reasons Tesla was so successful is because they stopped trying to make the car look weird and tried to make it look sexy instead. Not a very hard concept to understand.It looks like a Scion tC fucked a Chevy Volt.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla is reportedly finally going to receive final approval to start production at Gigafactory Berlin this week after months of delays. Gigafactory Berlin, a critical new factory for Teslas plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency, has been in limbo for months.\n\nThe automaker has yet to secure the needed environmental permit to start producing vehicles for customer deliveries. Last month, Tesla confirmed that it built the first few Model Ys at Gigafactory Berlin at the end of 2021.\n\nThe automaker also received approval to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin ahead of the final approval by the state of Brandenburg. Tesla said it needed to conduct more tests of its production process, and it hasnt been approved to deliver those vehicles. However, it looks like the factory is up and running with hundreds of new Model Y vehicles spotted coming out of the factory last week.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-exp'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 10:12:44'] Well, by the time the gigafactory is up and running at full capacity -  European nrg costs should break every record high - by a wide margin.  Sure was green of Germany to not approve use of new Russian gas lines on the basis they don't run through Ukraine (i.e., Ukraine won't get transfer fees) - and instead use more coal.  Really have to admire their commitment to the environment.  Meanwhile, they hold up production of electric cars - and haven't issued their final environmental compliance blessing of same, yet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 12:01:31'] Great news and I knew the stock would go up as soon as it was approved.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 17:27:44'] I doubt it happens this month but I wonder if the Russia thing accelerated it
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 12:15:23'] Probably the recent haste in trying to get free of Ruski gas, "expedited" the process.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 23:26:54'] Three things that helped the stock IMO.1. Renewed interest in EVs to escape the vagaries of international oil markets.2. Musk delivering Starlink receivers to Ukraine garnering positive attention.3. Belief that the stock is a relative bargain.Many investors in Tesla are emotional investors and will buy on emotion and momentum. The Berlin and Austin plants coming online will be very important but it remains to be seen if they can get enough components to complete their ambitious production goals that investors expect.The uncertainty of the situation in Ukraine will keep things volatile but if it resolves peacefully (basically the world not getting incinerated) then it will rally massively. Of course almost everything else will too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 02:42:58'] Buy and hold. Energy, robotaxi’s and insurance will be huge if you’re willing to hold for 5-10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 04:58:15'] If you're gonna buy it based on some Reddit comments, you're just gonna make the same mistake and sell out at the wrong time again.If you want to know if you should own the stock, do your own projections. Personally, I would focus on two things with Tesla: automotive and FSD.**Automotive**For automotive, I would go the traditional route and look at revenue, earnings and a PE value. If you annualize Q3, Tesla is at a PE of 190. In 2021 and 2022 I expect them to grow around 80% in unit sales, revenue by 70%. In terms of net income, I expect 1,100% in 2021 and at least another 100% in 2022. If this indeed happens, they'd be at a trailing PE of 52 by the end of 2022, which makes them a screaming buy in my eyes.But perhaps your numbers are different, so do your own projections and make your own thesis.**FSD**For FSD, I would go through the following metrics to create your own projection:* How many cars will they sell roughly each year throughout this decade?* Add those together, add 1 million cars that are already sold, and multiple that by .9 to get total cars on the road in 2030 (roughly 5-10% of cars will be taken out of commission before then).* Estimate the FSD subscription cost per month in 2030. Currently it's $200, Elon has already said FSD price will increase significantly in the future, supposedly this goes for both subscription and full purchases.* Estimate the FSD take rate. Currently it's around 10% in the US, where it works best. Obviously this will go up significantly if your car could fully drive itself and earn you money by serving as a robotaxi.* Multiply total vehicles on the road by FSD take rate and multiple that by monthly subscription price to get revenue per month.* Multiply that by 12 to get FSD revenue per year.* Estimate the expected margin percentage. This is a software service, so probably somewhere between 70 and 90%.* Multiply yearly FSD revenue by the margin percentage to get the operating income.* Multiply that by 0.8 to get a rough estimation of Net Income per year.* Estimate what you think Tesla's PE ratio will be by 2030. Lower than 20 is unrealistic, higher than 90 probably is too.* Multiply the annual net income by the PE multiple to get Tesla's market cap by 2030.When you've done all that, put % on the chance you think Tesla has of solving full autonomy this decade, to determine how likely you think that valuation is to come true. No matter which numbers I use, I believe Tesla is a clear buy if they solve FSD this decade, but perhaps you come to a different conclusion.**The rest**Finally, there's everything else... Supercharger revenue, solar/energy sales, energy software revenue (autobidder), AI, HVAC, and any new products/services Tesla is yet to release. All of these are too difficult to project right now in my opinion, and they're just a bonus to Tesla's market cap that could range from a negligible part to a significant part of their business in 10 years' time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 02:30:49'] It’s one of my biggest positions, up already 108%. Will do the same that I did last time, when they go for another stock split I’ll add a bunch more.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 09:36:35'] Definitely way overvalued and sell. That's because I can't forecast more than 6 months out, uses only P/E as my investment metric, and think the competition is coming to kill Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 10:06:29'] Buy. The big are only getting bigger for now. Tesla has too many advantages to fail. P/e is high but that’s kind of how it goes with a stock as aggressive and I’m going to say it “hyped”
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 12:46:40'] Buy and hold. Likely to be the biggest company in the world in 5-10 years
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:54:18'] Hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 22:19:23'] I can't understand why even now, after the company has been cash flow positive for about a year, selling a million cars in a year when the entire industry was down because for chip shortage, people are still reluctant to understand value when they see it. In many European countries Tesla is a niche player b cause they didn't have a service network and had to ship every car by boat. Now they have a huge factory in the biggest car market of Europe.... so hold on to your shares, nobody can do what Tesla can, don't look at a few attractive models from Ford or Audi, or..... manufacturing at the scale of millions is a totally different thing and the competition would bankrupt only with EV sales as their margins are razor thin.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 22:55:08'] Hold through (T)QQQ index.Not holding directly because of how risky it still is.I like lower risk lower growth stocks like FAANG or semiconductorsFor TSLA and super high growth stocks with negative profits or crazy PEs (all those cloud stocks) I like to hold them via ETFs to lower riskTSLA is already almost 5% of QQQ which is a decent portfolio weighting

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 06:19:48'] Considering we’re on the precipice of the electric revolution and Tesla is the leading name in the space, I’d say it’s a buy/hold for the next 10-20 years easily. You wouldn’t have sold railroad stock once the east and west were connected would you?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 03:43:00'] Tesla is under valued right now if you extend their profits with Austin/Berlin online they would have a PE of 15.....and if they realize FSD/AI and energy grid goals those businesses could be bigger than their future EV production....so yeah its the easiest buy of your life
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 14:00:23'] Hmmmm a car company that sells 1% of volume globally, but is worth the same value as the all of the other car makers combined that sell the other 99% and as an industry adding EV's faster than Tesla? Let me think?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 04:24:13'] I absolutely love Tesla I was so skeptical (bearish) during the run up pre-split I bought into a lot of the fud and overvaluation hype until I started to really understand the business model and how many streams of revenue they have that haven’t even begun producing money yet.  So much potential and I believe they will hit it.  What price are people buying at?  I don’t usually touch a stock during a run up like this, let it run is all I do if there is a pullback I add but what is a reasonable pullback for Tesla?  Will it continue to run up to 1000?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 23:30:11'] Buy more if you can. The Tesla story is going to mirror Amazon during the internet boom and Apple during the smartphone boom. I've invested through both these ages. I did not catch the Amazon wave, was still too young. But I've greatly benefited from the smartphone wave. I've read+watched enough evidence to conclude that EV is about to be disrupted big time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 21:03:50'] I hated Tesla and was bearish about it until this breakout. This is a buy. You're not buying a car company. It is on the surface, but I believe with lithium prices rising and Tesla already in a good place to control those prices, they will have a significant cost advantage over other autos. Their new factories will be more efficient than most other autos. I believe that they have unseen value due to their assembly line improvements and the brand itself. I'd love a Tesla, don't care much for other EVs. I'm sure more would agree with that than disagree. (I also like gm, but it's more of a value reason than a EV hot take.)When you look at this companies valuation, it doesn't make sense. But the management is extremely intelligent and continues to innovate. Also, the p/e has almost cut in half, that doesn't make it cheap, but it makes it the cheapest it's been in a while. I think this rally will last. I bought calls for earnings and made out well, but even though I think it could keep rolling, I sold all my options and put the profit into shares, which I view as safer.I plan on going long. This company will be a trillion dollar company at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 20:11:51'] I’ve held on tight since $350… then just sold on their latest earnings… but then immediately bought it back because I don’t want to imagine life without my TSLA stock.  I think it’s a hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 22:52:48'] TSLA is a cult and defies logic. I wish I realized this from the beginning.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 05:52:58'] Just like Amzn, Tesla stock throughout its history has always been expensive. This is actually the cheapest the stock has ever been if you look at the PE ratio, their cash position and stability and maturity of the business. Their forward PE is in 100 range. And even if the stock doubles I think PE would be under 100 in 5 years. So long term it’s a buy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 20:00:58'] Overvalued. Stay away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 00:08:07'] A sell, it's completely overvalued. Any money you put in is dead money for 2-3 years at least.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 20:21:29'] Just heard a presentation from a financial advisor that seemed sensible here. Focus on an investment size vs binary buy/hold. Like maybe you dedicate 50k of a portfolio to TSLA. Sell if your position is outsized, buy if you still want to hold and it becomes undersized. I like this because it promotes diversification and captures profits while keeping you in companies you want to hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 23:46:03'] If I wanted that kind of volatility I'd just go with crypto.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 19:50:26'] It might hit 1k for new ATH when BTC rallies but I am going to be buying puts when it does.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 20:01:54'] Sell. too many competitors entering the market which may drive innovation outside of Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 21:16:56'] Its a shoulda held for sure. Who knows for the future though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 21:23:24'] If you’d buy it at the current price if you didn’t already own it, then hold. If you wouldn’t buy it at the current price and already hold it, then sell. Valuations are completely subjective and vary depending on speculative projections.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 03:29:24'] Cathie has been right so far, ya know
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 12:38:51'] I've been making good money selling naked puts on it. I closed my position before earnings and I'm not opening another short put unless it either drops or shows that it's stable at this level for a while. Last time it $900 there was a big tech selloff immediately after, it dropped like $200, and I was stressed as hell about that put for several days.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 17:53:13'] I don’t buy these pricey stocks, however if you’re questioning something like this I’d suggest you start off with a good value stock and buy more shares.  You’ll get dividends down the road and won’t be subject to wild price fluctuations in growth stocks especially heading into 4th quarter.  AT&T is beaten down at the moment.  If you’ve got the stomach to hold on, it could have excellent upside potential.  Any active trader will step up his game to learn to trade covered calls around stocks you own if there is any downside to reduce your basis rather than getting out and cutting a loss.  Hang in there and invest longterm on solid blue chip companies.  Tesla is fine, it’s just pricey.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 20:36:31'] I'd say hold! IMO eoy it will be 1600 bucks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 05:08:33'] I'm not buying more only just because it's so expensive and  also being a poor guy from a third world country. I kinda want them to do another split just so that the price became more palatable. The company is doing better than ever imo, fundamentals seems to be improving every quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 05:39:29'] The price for the last two years has been linked to an idyllic vision of the company that has very little to do with a company selling cars. If you think Tesla will not only dominate the car industry in 10 years, but also the energy sector and the energy storage industry then Tesla is an ok buy. If not, don't touch that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 06:02:38'] Remarquably overvalued but it’ll probably go to 1000s
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 06:09:10'] Options IV went up 50% yesterday on less than a 2% gain in share price, and the first time ever it closed above $900, after almost a year of consolidation. Technicals are as bullish as they ever have been. Anything under $1000 is at least a 50% discount over what it will be worth this time next year, FOR ME at least. I have a small position and the last time I bought shares was last year with an avg position cost of $423/ea. I started adding to TSLA this week but I’m 50% in crypto/crypto miner options till January, probably half of all profit from now to January will be used to add to the TSLA position. None of this is a recommendation
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 06:25:56'] Tesla is a cult, I love investing in cults (Apple is my other favorite company) - also, Tesla is going to end up powering the country some day, the cars will be peanuts in comparison to what the company will become.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 07:09:03'] One of my first purchases in 2019 when I started investing, my average price for that year adjusted after split is around $50 a share. I still buy little chunks now on days where it dips more than say 2-3%. I think it still has room to run. Elon always has something he's working on to expand the business.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 07:11:21'] Tesla is definitely a buy if you don’t own any shares IMO, if you already have a position in it then hold. This stock is just the best growth stock of this decade !

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 07:40:34'] Tesla is cyclical, but it seems to still be a fast grower despite it being a large market cap stock.

POST_TEXT: b'TSLA has a following approaching cult status--and it has served the early birds in TSLA for YEARS when there was a lot more skepticism. However, at some point, TSLA will get more competitors--and with more competition comes more EV car buyers NOT buying a Tesla and opting for an alternative.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 11:41:57'] I really don't know about the whole "they will get competitors" line. The other auto manufacturers have had 6 years to come up with a meaningful competitor to the model 3, and the closest they've got are the Chevy Bolt (sucks) and Porsche Taycan (way too expensive). If that's the best the competitors have managed to do in 6 years, I'm starting to give up on them. As long as Tesla doesn't drop the ball, by the time the other competitors "catch up", Tesla should be comfortably another 10 years ahead of them.I know making cars is hard. I know it's a tough industry. I get it, but my god, the innovation in the industry outside of Tesla for the past 20 years has been a pitiful joke.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 10:12:27'] When will TSLA start buying up smal companies like $VLCN to gain a better stock price? That or share buybacks seems to be the only two options left to keep the current risen in valuation in place.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 07:52:06'] There's no point to analyzing Tesla anymore. It's a stock that's separate from the market. Any other company misses on revenue and shows negative fcf, they'd be down 20 percent. I'm not a Tesla bull or bear. I just watch in awe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 15:09:57'] Everyone that uses an ICE car a lot can afford an EV as the insane reduction in running and maintenance costs make up for the monthly cost of the car.Tesla's competition are also irrelevant. They're already worth more than other car manufacturers combined despite being outsold by many of them individually. Given that there's no reason to believe that sentiment should change in the future. Tesla's value is based purely on its historic value. It will be $1000 a share again purely because it has been before. Bullish and bearish news will affect sentiment but there's no reason to believe it's market cap will ever reflect it's finances. Tesla's is a cult and swing trading stock. Its financial fundamentals and that of it's competitors are completely irrelevant at any given moment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 10:03:48'] <Tesla bagholder>None of that matters because reason reason reasons reasons reasons</Tesla bagholder>>with more competition comes more EV car buyers NOT buying a Tesla and opting for an alternative. as of 2020, Tesla sold about 15% of EVs globally, meaning the large majority were sold by other carmakers. yet the stock is priced like Tesla is gonna dominate not only the EV space but autos generally. it's delusional.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 00:32:04'] >TSLA has a following approaching cult statusPeople keep saying this but I don't get it. Tesla makes a good product (and a good product environment) and people love that. A cult is something not based on merit. If appreciation is based on OBJECTIVE merit then it's not a cult.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 09:32:16'] I’m an index fund investor so I own plenty of Tesla in my portfolio but as a passive investor, I don’t really have to worry as much about individual companies so I could care less about the bull or bear case. Just showing my neutrality. That said, I have been amazed that the stock has taken off as much as it has. They seem to have some of the “secret sauce” which I love for my portfolio but I think the writer of the article has very sound points. I’m definitely concerned that rising costs, competition and supply issues will affect Tesla in the long term. Sure, it’s a disruptive company but at the end of the day, I’m still just not sold on it continuing to dominate the way it has for the past several years. Time will tell but I think we have to be rational and tread carefully

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 16:47:19'] Tesla is in the dog house for now. Supply chain issues, chip shortage, major problems with fraud/lying to customers on the solar/energy side, low moral at the company, Musk losing focus on it, lots of recalls, reputation for poor build quality, increasing competition, the list goes on....Im holding it for now but when it goes near ATH again, Im out until the next downturn. I made the mistake of treating this company like a long term value investment, like VOO or AAPL. It should be swing traded, buying when it crashes and selling when fan boys cause a skyrocket using stop limits. Musk is too unpredictable, making it a perfect swing trade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 16:10:16'] Tesla stock once went down cause Elon smoked a joint on Joe Rogan’s podcast. Went down another time cause he tweeted about his company being overvalued. Another time cause he liquidated his Tesla holdings to try to buy Twitter. Man’s too much of a trailblazer and people don’t really buy into that until it’s too late. Keep holding as long as the fundamentals are good
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 15:49:27'] Tesla is doomed, Elon himself said that both Texas and Germany are going through cash like crazy, furthermore pretty much all the manufacturers are rolling out electric cars that are much better quality than Tesla and lower prices.  There are tons of other reasons

But Apple is 2.25T market cap and Tesla is 700bn.If you value shares as a DCF Tesla is already grossly overvalued.  Let's say its profit is roughly 16 times Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation ($110m net income FY '21), then its market cap would be around $4bn, not $700bn.   Even accounting for future growth doesn't bring the number into the realm of rationality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 17:13:07'] Depends on what comes out the next few quarters. If he can still impress the Wallstreet pulling new numbers out of his sleeves, control the expense, its over-valued stock price could stay.  I see VW, Ford, or GMC catching up as undisputed leaders in eV manufacturing. It took \~ 30 years converting the eVs to IC engine in the 19 and early 20 century before. It will even take longer because IC engine is more efficient than ever. Another consideration is high cost of Lithium and limited availability. There are just 14M tonnes mines discovered on earth making \~200M eV cars. We have 1,400M vehicles on earth. The cost of raw material has quaded in 1 year at $40,000 a tonne in early 2022. Its price was 1/10 ten years ago. Li cost will reach $54,000 later this year.  Tesla consumed $19K tonnes of Li 4 years ago. The process of refining Li has not got caught up with strong demand. That goes for lithiunm.  There are also nickel, manganese, cobalt and graphite involved. Each raw material, extraction, and sourcing can be a momumental challenge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 17:19:28'] A massive risk to solely competing (and building highly specialized manufacturing processes) in EV is that other technologies have the potential to be more efficient and cheaper and/or there could be a massive shift in consumer behavior as the country becomes more urbanized.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 18:17:14'] It seems news about other cars is not reaching all, all companies including one of the best seller F-150 is coming as electric , the edge tesla had was it was an early mass EV company but now so many other EVs models are there and its just a matter of time when some company launches budget 20-30k EV then it EV market will be like regular cars
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 18:31:52'] Competition from other companies !!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-04 20:03:52'] Maybe the Model S or X are quality vehicles. I was planning on buying a Model 3 until I test drove one. It looked and felt like a 30k vehicle at best. The interior looked and felt cheaply made. The tech is good, but everything else was a bit underwhelming.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-16 11:26:24'] Tesla demand is through the roof. They can keep raising the cost on their vehicles if they want with 0 negative impact on their sales, because they have demand to spare.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-16 09:15:30'] Short sellers have been abusing this for years to pretend Tesla sales "have collapsed". Every first month of the quarter they sell nothing, after that they blast past everyone. They're now even the brand that's selling the most EVs in Germany, the country where people said they would never gain any traction. And that's without even having the Berlin factory with much higher quality cars being online yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-16 12:23:07'] Good of you to highlight this. Tesla sales in Norway have always been in "bulk". Tesla Model 3 was by far the most sold car model in Norway in 2021 and Tesla the highest selling brand.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-17 01:34:55'] All auto numbers are meaningless right now because many models are selling out, not just Tesla. Anything even remotely fuel efficient is flying including hybrids. Its just a matter of who can get supplies to make them and how fast they can get them to a customer.In other words you cannot conclude anything from current environment. Even my brother ended up buying a Tesla only because it was the only thing available. He wanted a Mach-E but the wait is likely over a year. He did order a Lightning in the 2nd wave but he probably wont see that till year end. He is hoping to just sell the Tesla once the truck arrives.Told him this is a horrible idea and to wait but he has cash to burn so he just went for it since the Tesla was ready now and his car was on its last leg.I will say however, he is very unhappy with his Model-Y. Aside from being electric and fast charging, it feels very cheap. The interior is cheesy, the seats are not comfortable, the AC circulation sucks and the self driving is absolutely worthless. Literally there is no point to it at all except maybe self parking for someone who doesnt know how to park a car...But worst of all, he had it about 3 weeks when there was some sort of recall and the car has been in the shop for 4 weeks since... its literally been in the shop longer than he had possession and what did they give him as a loaner? A tiny M3... He is not happy at all and they keep pushing back the return date due to supply problems. He has already talked to a lawyer though was told there is nothing they can do yet.All anecdotal of course, but I used it too and was underwhelmed as well. The interior is indeed cheesy. It feels like a budget 70s car with major kick of course.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:09:34'] UNHUnited Health is a steady rocket ship. Check out the chart since about 2008. It’s not a sexy stock but it’s a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here’s why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically “price fixing”. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.How do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that’s not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we’re forced into annual increases no matter what.The health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There’s no way that’s the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences… low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. Just food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation… lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:05:32'] United Microelectronics (UMC) will see some short-term pain, but already trade at a discount and are well-positioned and growing in automotive and communications.With the capacity to ship 10 million wafers a year, a relatively bulletproof balance sheet, a likely to be fat dividend (if they return the same % of earnings as they did last year it'll be ~10% yield), and additional capacity coming online in Taiwan as well as Singapore over the next couple of years I really like their odds of returning to strong growth in the medium term. That being said I do intend to wait for another dip before adding again since I have a decent chunk already and 1H23 looks pretty shaky.

Tesla shares are down more than 15% over the last five sessions. \n\nIt seem Elon will keep selling Telsa stocks this week to finish his 10% goal.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-15 22:59:00'] Tesla is ridiculous, I think whats happened is this easy credit from low interest rates has increased disposable income by a huge amount, and stocks have become a kind of casino due to such a large investment by the large unwashed masses of average people who have never touched stocks before recently.It almost seems like a case study.  My aunt and 21 year old daughter is now into stocks, these people fall for multilevel marketing and they are investing now, things are crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-15 12:08:40'] It’s funny of a lot of you because all I see is the atmosphere of this sub changed to a little negative or distrust to Elon Musk when the stock pulled back from ATH. People start back to talk a little about production and valuation, instead of purely potential, to justify your argument and fulfil your ego.When it’s 1200 you all keep saying 3000 next week sth like that and pedestalising Elon Musk like a God. And now suddenly some say Elon Musk can’t be trusted that much. Some of you really are hilarious.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-15 09:35:21'] It didn't even take the liquidity at 480 but this run up could definitely cause a free fall. I would be cautious putting any positions in the current value it is in

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 10:13:40'] I’ve stopped trying to tell bears about the meat of Tesla; now I just grab the popcorn and watch them embarrass themselves month after month
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 08:23:24'] I've never seen a company like Tesla in all my time watching the markets (15 years). Early on it was argued as overvalued because it was speculative on the affordable model. After Model 3, it continually missed production targets and wavered in pricing. When it started hitting production targets late 2019 and after it increased 800%. Now, it is recognized as a low margin business (by Musk himself) similar to other car manufacturers. I've been one of the biggest Tesla bulls I've ever known going back to when I had to debate Tesla vs. Ford to an experienced alternative investment manager, a partner at a small fund, during a job interview. But, I need to say at this point, something is not right or I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid right. It doesn't make sense that a low margin and almost fully matured business is growing the way Tesla does. This looks like a massive bubble and I would advise people take some or a majority of earnings before the pin drops.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 09:31:11'] The funny thing is, even if TSLA is worth this market cap, do you really think it can be worth MORE than this? It's already insane forward PE, but if you drop in money now, do you really think it's going to go up that much more from here?

THIS RIGHT HERE, is the switch from internal combustion engines to electric - mainly through utilizing lithium instead of gasoline. It’s well worth it. Also, Tesla helps Elon Musk develop his private companies - SpaceX which will increase Earths access to rare metals by a million fold in the next 100 years easily, and NeuraLink which will be the high-bandwidth computer interface operating system device that Microsoft Windows was to the 1990s. And StarLink which will be the faster more stable and more efficient internet company that  will topple Comcast and destroy the monopoly on data transmission, and the Boring Company which has expertise that will enable safer colonies onMars and and allow a boost in dense city transportation traffic. This is the future. 10,000 years ago Europe went from sword type A (bronze) to sword type B (steel) in just under 400 years America went from wood wagons to safe nuclear power, moon landings, touchscreen devices, electric vehicles, computers, etcetera. If room/space is made for progress and the improvement of the human condition and quality of life, it will flourish.Innovation is here and Elon Musk is bringing the change.

You can stack chiplets on top of each other for more performance. 200mb of SRAM on each chiplet.Factoring how many chiplets on TR/EPYC it would be 1.6GB of SRAM which would be incredibly fast. Imagine the performance of things like DBs on it. It should be stupid fast.CPUs will likely move from being cach strapped to core strapped.

POST_TEXT: b"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.\n\nBeing a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' \n\nHowever, there has been a change. Things"

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:33:59'] People calling you out for not selling at 800% would call you out for not selling at 80%. Good job, I think you did the right thing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:55:03'] I’m not a TSLA holder, but my feelings are exactly as you described. You did great at 180%, and when you know, you know. Nice write up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:47:55'] In short, it's brand value - the thing atop which a lot of its market cap was balanced - is tanking because the eccentricities are ramping up uncontrollably. It's a life lesson for a lot of small business owners too on how to behave in the public eye.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:24:25'] Congrats on doing well w the investment. Enjoyed the read and the perspective. Tesla is one of those things I would have loved to have bought 5 years ago but I didn’t and just never trusted the wave after.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 02:31:43'] Not even considering your point about changing customer sentiment in the West (with which I entirely agree) and the growing number of EV alternatives, I think it’s also worth looking at where Tesla sees its growth now. There is a clear bet on China which I personally think is becoming increasingly risky: China has its own EV producers and supply chains, it doesn’t need Tesla (or selling in the West), while Tesla desperately needs China. Furthermore, the confrontation with the West and the economic competition is becoming more intense, there are talks of decoupling, multinational firms are starting to establish alternative supply chains, there are already some strategic bans on technology transfers on the us side (semiconductors) and import bans (xianjiang), I wouldn’t be surprised at all if within the next 5 years China retaliates and Tesla gets trapped. Of course, all automotive OEMs have a footprint in China, but mostly in their supply chains, i don’t think any of them have that much China exposure to their top line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:25:35'] I’m in the same boat and honestly don’t see how the company can move forward with a huge market share anymore. I work in tech in a very red state, so my workplace is pretty 50/50 with different viewpoints, but almost everyone I work with can actually afford a Tesla. There’s a very weird paradox that has developed in the past year and it does not fair well for Tesla at all in my opinion:Last year, all of my younger coworkers (myself included) loved Elon, and also loved Tesla. All of my older coworkers didn’t care about Elon, but hated Tesla.Now in the present, all of my younger coworkers hate Elon and also hate Tesla. Some of these folks have traded in their Teslas lol. All of my older coworkers love Elon, but they still hate Tesla.Overall, now EVERYONE I work with hates Tesla. Now my workplace could be a bad representation of the country as a whole, but in my personal experience the future does not look bright.

Use a zip code in Bay Area like 94040. I’m pretty sure there were almost no Model X a week ago. Today, I see dozens of Model X configs available. I imagine those who can afford a 100+k car are more sensitive to exactly what you described. These are likely orders placed months ago that the customer decided to cancel. Of course the recession is playing a role but it looks more than that. On the other hand, Model 3 inventories are gone, likely the $7,500 incentive helped.I’ve been in and out of TSLA since IPO. Was long till 2 years ago and  turned bearish because I realized we were in a textbook style asset bubble. My mistake was starting puts a bit too early and had to take some loss (offset easily by gains from other tech stocks), but as of now, I’m in a fairly good position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:34:36'] Nice job.  I was also a Tesla fan and can’t help but wonder if full self driving is significantly impacting their credibility.  Elon said it will be fully functional in a couple years around 8 years ago at this point.  I don’t think people will continue to add the feature considering they haven’t delivered.  Cybertruk and the semi also seem to be having problems delivering.  Elon has also indicated they are building a robot now?  I can only assume it’s to work on Mars prior to the arrival of people?  Long story short - Tesla has lost focus.  Supporters would often stand in line and put deposits on their vehicles because they believe in the mission (as you said).  As they fail to deliver, this fan base will continue to dwindle.  Add these points to the amazing point in your post and I think Tesla is in trouble.  There’s also the fact that they clearly haven’t figured out full self driving.  How many cars will they need to retrofit because they were sold as full self driving capable?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:39:13'] A whole essay on your experience holding Tesla, and not a single word about valuation, fundamentals, projections, or just any kind of data.What do you expect Tesla to earn in a year? And in five? And in ten? What market cap does that translate into based on a fair PE (or better yet PEG)? What's the ROI if you discount that?That's the question you should be asking yourself. Stock prices and news are just noise. Seems to me like you were gambling holding Tesla, and now you're gambling selling it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:42:32'] It’s a well developed narrative regarding your TSLA stock adventure. Since 2016 to 2022 is a longtime investment. I applaud you for your longterm investment. 1500 shares and you gained 800% and you didn’t sell is a foolish move not to sell at that time. Either way you didn’t lose any money. Elon is not unhinged, he is taking risky bets and decision is causing TSLA shareholders headache. I am certain TSLA will go back to all time high. End of 2023. Buying the dip would be ideal, many smart money managers are waiting for market to settle and fed rate hike to halt. That way buy low and sell high could be in play by next mid year. Wait for that opportunity Imo. Congratulations on your gain . Remember you gotta be in it to win it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:52:25'] The thing is it’s not going to maintain insane growth forever and obviously it was overvalued during the last year just like many other companies. It deserves a decent PE ratio, maybe like a 30, which is considered high during a regular market cycle. I think you did the right thing and the stock belongs at $70-80

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:39:32'] It's interesting how many people bought for Elon and not the companyIf he steps down from Tesla I assume it will return and stay at non-inflated pricesI don't think you're correct with your assumption that people will feel bad about buying a Tesla. Tesla is still the only EV most potential purchasers can name. His Twitter antics don't mean anything to sales, they are still selling their manufacturing capacity. The amount of people who actually care what he does with Twitter is probably fairly small.Has there been a decline in sales, or other numbers, that you're basing this on? Or is it all emotions/feelings for you?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:22:38'] I actually don’t think anyone cares about any of this.   You wrote a whole lot and some of it was interesting, but in the end, nobody cares.  Your anecdotal stories about your friends are just that, and nobody is looking at someone driving a Tesla and thinking “I bet that person believes in everything Elon musk has ever done or tweeted”.  If you are, you’re and idiot.  There are literally countless brands that have survived the absolute worst founders and ceos imaginable.  Shit Volkswagen was founded by hitler and the nazi party and people still buy those.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:23:49'] Only thing that recently bothered me about Elon is the stupid decision to buy twitter for 34 billion. I guess it's better to buy a social media platform than to invest it into your own company . But hey it's not my money and I'm not one of the richest people on the planet so what do I know ? It's also only a matter of time before big car manufacturers start offering full EV vehicles at large scale.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:35:38'] The only thing I will say is that Elon is not more right wing than he has been in the past. His beliefs roughly map out exactly the same as before.The only difference is that the left has been attacking him relentlessly for the last 5 years, and him calling out corruption on the left that has singled him out has made people on the left very angry despite Elon being correct to point out injustice and corruption in the first place.OH, Biden was the only president to not mention successful space missions because it was with SpaceX? Biden didn't invite Tesla or ever mention it when talking about EVs? Despite the fact that Trump had no interest in EVs or global warming, he still reached out to Elon with open arms, who was a very prominent and public Democrat at the time. Biden turning Elon into public enemy #1 when he has done more to advance green energy, job creation and manufacturing in the US, AI dominance, and space and energy independence/leadership is just straight up corruption because we all know who donates to Democratic politicians. Alameda County tried to literally bankrupt Tesla by being the only place to prevent manufacturing in the US indefinitely when Tesla only had one real factory producing at scale? Warren and Sanders and AOC and Reich tried to call Elon evil for the last 5 years just so they could take his Tesla shares as taxes? The media called Elon a MAGA Republican despite him never previously voting for a Republican (including Trump)? The media making up lies about his Twitter takeover and covering up the Biden laptop, government collusion, speech suppression and censorship, and blatant 1st amendment violations, and the SBF fraud while making Elon look like some evil dictator? Let it be known that the left deliberately tried to destroy Twitter before Elon even tried to do anything to fix it by forcing an advertiser boycott, causing him to fire 75% of the staff to reach cash flow neutral, which then the left used to call him a monster.You can't repeatedly punch a guy who fixed your house and put your kid through college and expect him to keep his mouth shut. And then to call him some sort of racist/homophobe/evil capitalist trying to destroy America as some fascist when literally the definition of fascism is government control of private companies by groups of people fascinated and preoccupied with notions of racial supremacy and authoritarian rule that has restricted free speech (literally the current Democratic platform), is just insult to injury. The fact that people give friends of Esptein a pass like Clinton and Bill Gates, and support companies like Apple that build phones in sweatshops with suicide nets just to call Elon Musk a crazy person who is immoral and losing his grip on reality is just rich.

Look at what's happening in the world & the economy.The facts are that Tesla is now a profitable company, will it always be that? i don't know. But people are still buying their product, ALOT of people. If Tesla had no plans or interesting products for the future, i would heavily consider cashing out. This is not the case.Too many people are getting emotional over Tesla, i mean it's sad to see analysts calling Elon to " get back to work on Tesla "

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:53:02'] I plan on buying 100k shares when it becomes sub $100. I see intrinsic value long term especially with how quickly the EV market is adapting. No one is talking about the analytic machine Elon just bought to pair well with people who aren’t immediate Tesla users. It’s easy to downplay someone who is constantly portrayed in the media as “radical” but in reality you are listening to the media, which is completely bought and paid for. You don’t have to be far left/right to realize that over the past couple years everything that we indulge is bullshit. If you watch CNBC daily then yes you should most definitely sell right now. But if you got the cajones and nothing but time it’s a value play. What I’m really looking forward to though, might be the cherry on top, is driving my cyber truck 3.0 on Mars. Now that’s gonna be cool.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:00:21'] Thank you for sharing. Interesting that the post talks about brand importance and share price levels but not a single time was there mention of being overvalued. Did you not feel like Tesla was overvalued at any point of holding the stock? If Tesla was valued at say under 8x, would it incurred the drop it did this year? Doubt it. Value is value and investors will care very little who the CEO is or what he does as long as there are results and growth. Tesla rate of growth and innovation has peaked and future growth looks uncertain. Add Elon antics and you have what you see today - overvaluation and brand destruction
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:27:36'] I think two things are more and more clear:- Tesla is vastly overvalued and personally I don't think they have a long term future. They managed to get there first and push EV development forward - but they haven't managed to transition into actual normal operations - polishing existing models periodically, improving QA etc. - Elon Musk is pretty bad at most things he do - but he had 1-2 things going for him: He was really good at getting investment money (in the super low cost period that is now over) and he was able to attract competent people to actually run the companies and do the technology development. He *did* have a knack for getting into exciting future sectors. But that's it. He is actually a shit manager and decision maker. And he is not an engineer, but a poser. All of that has been more and more apparent for a while. And the Twitter acquisition was just the culmination of bad judgement and big ego.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 00:59:34'] There’s that saying, nobody has lost money making a profit. And so on. But you make another comparison of founder and brand, but neglected to mention jobs and Apple. I mean, if there was ever the parallel comparison of founder and brand, this would be it. So many people had portrayed musk as the next jobs. But that ship has sailed because of another saying, you live long enough and the hero becomes the villain and that’s exactly what’s happening here. Musk has lost it and the next cool ev is not that far away, although as we speak I don’t see it yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 21:46:23'] Musk was an evangelist for evs and that drove Tesla adoption. He created the demand and he can kill it(and seems to be working actively on doing so)The other issue is that he has now lied so many times his credibility is basically gone.Other car manufacturers got a kick in the rear from Tesla and are now catching up fast. Tesla may have been the cool vehicle to have but when you can get a better manufactured car from a manufacturer with decades of expertise it’s going to lose a lot of its early sheen. They’re trying to be the iPhone of cars, but for that to work they have to be viewed as cool and musk is wrecking that image
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:05:21'] The libbies are upset with Elon? The automotive market is being hurt by the FOMC?Musk could care less who squirrels to a different tree or if the cult shrinks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:00:05'] This guy gets it. Elon IS the brand (I would have used Steve Jobs 10 years ago with Apple instead of Bill Gates, but whatever).More anecdotal evidence: I live in a Tesla-heavy county in Northern CA. EVERYONE I know was talking about buying a Tesla as their next car 1-2 years ago (including me). Now everybody talks about what an asshole Elon is, and how they'd NEVER buy a Tesla (including me). And my friend who loves her two Teslas (a 3 and an S) is thinking about getting rid of them out of embarrassment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:16:14'] Well put.  You captured my new feelings towards Tesla exactly.  I pulled into a coffee shop just this morning saw two teslas and thought, "that's embarrassing".  I had Tesla as my potential next car, now I just keep thinking how dumb it must be to have bought one of those things at $80k or above.  The fan fare of Elon Musk swings both ways.  Good for you to recognize that early.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:15:02'] Before I’m mostly an eth person for my active investing, but accumulating Tesla now when Elon come out as a strong leader. Had there are more leaders like him, fed will never have to raise rates like this. His leadership skills is what impresses me the most so I honestly wish it drops to 50 so this time I can keep dca into Tesla. He is the type of leader US need most for many business. Twitter is now has least 50% less workers but is delivering the same if not better services. There is certainly less crazy bans compared to pre Elon. More and more companies are now focusing on worker productivity plunging and Elon is certainly ahead of the game and most aware of this trend for all big corps. Google, sales force and recent news in Tencent are all having reports that ceo had been much more straightforward about the alarming productivity drop. This iteration of democrats are taking america to a hellish path with their policies.

That doesn’t sit well. I was the biggest Elon fan and  Supporter. Losing a couple hundreds grand is a couple hundreds grand. I don’t have Elon billions. It’s not going to break me but I invest for retirement and passing my investments to my kids to help with their life. I’m not into supporting  some rich dude playing online and costing 100’000’s of us lots of money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:01:56'] I'm honestly also one of those people you're talking about OP. A very long time ago even before Tesla started gaining any traction & before it was in the news all the time, I discovered Tesla and told a lot of people about this amazing car I really wanted.Then I started to follow Musk on Twitter and realised for myself what a POS he was even before the sub incident so stopped following him. Then the sub incident happened and Musk started to slowly snowball into an even bigger POS and as he grew bigger my interest in wanting a Tesla became smaller and eventually I no longer wanted one.Then a good friend invested in them and very quickly turned into an obsessed cultists just because of how much money it made him, and eventually convinced me invest too. I managed to put my morality a side for a while, but whenever I was going to sell at the top he convinced to hold on, and I did not because I believed in Tesla, but because I believed dumbasses like him would continue to pump it and I was in it for the ride.Then at the beginning of the year the markets started coming down and I finally managed to pull out entirely while taking some profit, and kept contemplating whether I should invest back into Tesla alongside the others, but my morality just taking even bigger hits as Musk had turned into one of the biggest c**ts on the planet.Now just like with Facebook I longer want anything to do with Elon & Tesla. I got rid of Twitter because of him too (though I physically can't log back in to delete my account) and I just hope my friend's sake he'll wake up before he loses everything.There's only one small thing I disagree with though in your view, and that's that Tesla can never shake its association with Musk. I believe it could eventually but it would take a very long time after he's no longer involved. As you said now when you mention Bill Gates a lot of people do still think "Microsoft", however when you say "Microsoft" most people no longer think "Bill Gates" (aside from maybe those who still believe he's the richest man in the world).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 00:42:36'] Wise decision to get out now . As long as you are holding cash. You could always get in again anytime when there are potential. As of now , the pyramid scheme is fucked . Who know when it will goes below $58 . But it definitely it will keep going down and even more down after Q4 earning call. Elon may be planning to build up the pyramid again in 2023 -24 that why he said he won’t sell . So if thing goes well like he planned , you can get in again otherwise be happy with your 180% gain . You are way better than some folks that got in or DCA when it was above $280 . Elon had already cashed out those folks money . It may be hard for them to cut theirs losses. But who know , may be next week some of those folks will do Tax-loss harvesting. Coz they may feel the same way that you do and that will absolutely drive the price even lower and faster .

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:05:51'] I've noticed the general perception of Tesla's go from "wow unique practical EVs and luxury supercars" to "just like all the others, but with Elon Musk."I'd also say this perception change began in late 2019, accelerated during COVID, and then exponentially accelerated in Summer 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:51:12'] Has Been Real for me for the last year. It was fun to learn about the future and have faith in a company with such big ideas and opportunity, but it hasn't been real fun. It has gone up since I bought it. That is not why I invested; I did it because I believe in their mission and product. The bad news is that Elon Musk will continue to damage the brand because of his personal opinion on things, including climate change. Right now, this is not a big deal to me because I do think they will get through this difficult time and will have solid growth going forward, but my confidence could very easily be hurt if they are unable to execute well or if they cannot execute at all. Tesla's stock price hinged on the self-driving car market. I'm not sure what the prospects are of them building a monopoly in this space, but that was a major reason why I was comfortable investing. If they cannot execute well and they lose some time to competitors they will have trouble growing as quickly as they need to. To answer your second point, yes Elon Musk is a big advertising asset for TSLA. He is an amazing leader that has made incredible strides in the development of battery technology and has improved the efficiency of cars incredibly through Tesla's design. However, Elon Musk is also a big liability for TSLA. He is the face of the brand, which means that the people who are considering the purchase of a Tesla and those that already have one will be influenced by his antics, including his expensive tweets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:13:21'] I’m in the same boat, in a more modest way financially. I see the brand as fundamentally damaged. It may be that Musk himself already knows this, and a darker answer might be that he knows too hence the broken sell-off promise. Re the brand, Apple has outlived Steve Jobs…it’s doable with the right new leader. They also have huge production capacity and should be able to discount hard if they have too, but then they should/would be priced like other car companies, and you also have to factor in traditional things like costs to do new models etc. (Apple doing an M and A on Tesla is back to $60 would make a whole lot of sense…)I think you made a good decision.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:55:23'] Two years ago I downloaded Twitter because I could make minimum 10% on my money in a day if I got an alert when Elon Musk made a tweet about *any* company. Now he makes a tweet and I roll my eyes when I read about it on Reddit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:58:57'] Let’s be honest - those that made a boatload of money on Tesla got lucky. It was always a risky investment with a loose cannon CEO who’s valuation was always stretched but then went insane in the ‘free money’ bubble. If you had bought 9 other companies with similar characteristics you’d be Cathie Woods.My point is you may get lucky on something like Tesla - but don’t kid yourself it was skill because if you make an investment strategy out of it you’ll lose all your money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:16:50'] I don't see the upside with tsla. The other big companies make better vehicles, period. Tsla cannot compete with Toyota or Honda on quality nor scale. Tsla is going the way of the dodo. SpaceX is the best Elon company. Commercial space transport.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:24:54'] Congrats.I stayed out of Tesla for many reasons. Don’t regret it. Didn’t short at the top either. Just didn’t want any part of this stock (not saying it’s bad or good - just not for me). But again, cheers to you and anyone that has made money with the issue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:45:17'] I cannot imagine the sort of distorted thought process that would cause someone to sell a stock with such growth potential after a steep 70% fall within a few months. Absolute worst time to exit a position that I've seen in 3 decades of investing. The stock is certainly likely to rebound in the relatively near future, it represents so much innovation and intelligent process alpha. Now is the time to be accumulating Tesla in small amounts over regular intervals, investing is a marathon not a sprint, no one can call the bottom - or the top.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:39:37'] Totally agree. Couple of years back when i was thinking about electric cars, i was thinking tesla. Musk has always been arrogant and had some stupid tweets. But he used to stand for something. He told in every interview that his point was to accelerate towards renewable energy. He was just a smart nerd, who went arrogant after being succesfull. But nowdays with the resent couple of years erratic behavour, it seems like the guy is on some strong drugs. Messing up billion dollar companies. Promising to stand for free speech but two weeks later banning all his personal foes. You never know when he has a moods to fuck up a whole company in one week. The point is elon ruined the tesla reputation for me just like he created it years back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:48:53'] Makes sense to me.   Once it gets priced like it should be priced then get back in.   The issue is the price and not the company, IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:00:41'] I’ve been holding since 2012 and this isn’t the first time the stock has had massive volatility and pullback.  Solar city acquisition, 420.69 tweet, pedo tweet,  smoking weed, etc.. all caused people to pause.  I’ve sold a lot of shares after the first split and haven’t bought more shares since 2017 just due to portfolio weighting.  Ive made life changing money from it but still believe they are best in class.  I still love my 3 and x.  I am frustrated that my cyber truck preorder has been years delayed though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:13:29'] I got so greedy on some stocks this year,stocks that I could have sold with 200% profits at the start of 2022.Now those stocks are either barely above water or into the red.I still have some money left to buy good stocks at 52 weeks low though so crossing my fingers 2023 will not be a terrible year.Im eyeing Tesla but definitely not above $100.Musk create such a mess its hard how he is going to get out of it without losing more money.The cash losses Twitter had before he purchased it was bad now its a nightmare.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:29:49'] The decision to sell or hold onto an investment is a personal one and should be based on an individual's own financial goals and risk tolerance. It's important to carefully consider all relevant factors and do thorough research before making any investment decisions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:43:10'] I only held Tesla indirectly through a Momentum ETF, but I found it to be the beauty of such a rules based approach as it rode its risk adjusted momentum up massively, and then cut while down moderately. The issue so many retail investors have is psychological failings. They’ll sell a stock that’s a great stock to own because it’s up slightly, they’ll refuse to sell shit until its broken even because of an anchoring bias. They’ll become wed to a company no matter what the reality because they’ve somehow become a groupie of it. Emotion kills returns and retail is full of it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:10:08'] I think I lost some IQ points reading this. If the people selling TSLA *now* are this regarded, imagine how regarded those still holding are. Here’s some investment advice. Short TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 00:20:24'] I hope EM reads this, it aptly describes what many of us shareholders/customers believe. For me it was his "Prosecute Fauci" quip that sent me inexorably over the line. It's sad to think that Tesla had so much opportunity and goodwill before Elon undid his own reputation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:22:45'] Sorry to all investors including myself. When Elon open his F’ing mouth and start tweeting about right wing shits. Tesla investors are like republicans with trump. LoL

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:10:09'] I am one of those people who booked a Tesla after the $7500 incentive announcement, but cancelled shortly after sleeping over it. The company may perform well long term, but Elon’s antics definitely influenced my decision to not support the company. Moreover, looking at the well made, well equipped EVs expected to be released soon, a Tesla just isn’t that attractive an option anymore. Also tired of seeing Teslas everywhere in California, they are not unique anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:26:19'] This is well said and I entirely agree. I’m glad to have sold mine and worry about what Elon is doing next. I feel as if Tesla could kill it business wise but elons became so much weight that it would never really be realized to the extents it would be previous. It’s like watching the premium burn in real time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 20:03:15'] -69%
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 18:55:36'] He'd turn on FSD.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 18:57:46'] Unfortunately this is a cult stock because in part he is a magician it would go down massively and then depending what the company and new CEO does it would bounce back, as gates bezos and jobs, all stocks came off at first
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 15:31:05'] It’s pretty likely Elon will step down in the next couple of years. Once the cybertruck and roadster and out production, Tesla will have a vehicle in every major category at a variety of price points. Tesla will continue its shift in to perfecting the supply chain and mass producing cars, investing in its solar business, and expanding battery products. It would make sense for Tesla to insert a more operations focused CEO instead of a product visionary. This will let Elon focus more of his time his other ventures such as SpaceX. Tesla needs to be a boring company focused on execution, iteration, and delivering massive shareholder value. Apple set the playbook as Tim Cook took over and brought his rigid operations experience to scaling Apple. While apple has gotten significantly more boring, the economics of the company have never been better. Tesla could do well from the same treatment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 19:27:40'] Depends on if he steps down to go to Mars or if he becomes CEO of the next telecom giant.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 19:59:23'] The stock would likely get crushed since half its shareholders are buying due to his presence in the company and his creativity, execution, etc. I highly doubt he’d step down anytime soon though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 19:55:03'] Oooooooof
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:37:24'] I think it depends when it happens. If it's in the 5-10 year time frame, it should be ok. Tesla would be a much more mature company and should have someone with more experience running big companies anyway. Look at bezos stepping away from Amazon and what it did to that share price.If it happens earlier than 5 years I could see the stock price taking a hit, but Musk is too smart for that being the largest shareholder.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 02:32:44'] To answer this in one sentence..What happened to Apples shares when Steve Jobs died?They're doing... Just fine.And so will Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:26:06'] This won't happen, Elon trusts no one and only wants full control of every company he is in.His C suite leaves and he never replaced them. Who would a successor even be? Other leaders have long standing leadership plans but Elon actively does the opposite.It's more likely that he starts or latches onto three more companies than to give up control of Tesla.That in itself is a risk though. If Elon isn't able to lead Tesla suddenly the company will be in disarray as there is no clear second in command to step up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 00:11:30'] Elon already has a plan for thishe's founded a neuro tech company called Neuralinknaturally, when the time is right, Elon will announce via Twitter that they are working towards computerizing humans and he will simultaneously announce the development of Tesla's meta verse where physical humans & digital humans can interact with each otherthis will result in Tesla exploding to a $100T market cap as investors price in centuries of continued leadership under Elon

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 18:54:11'] Nothing, the stock will continue to go up. Makes no difference who the CEO is. This hero worship of Elon Musk needs to stop.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 01:42:56'] GGPI Polestar has better upside in the short term and less risk
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 19:16:37'] Personally I'd like the company more if he left. Elon is such a douchebag I couldn't imagine driving around in one of his cars all day. He's alienating more potential customers every day.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:04:36'] He need to spend lot of time in his space X. His recent stock purchase also related to reinvest in his space X. Anytime between 2022 to 2023  we get his CEO position step down news. And anytime, he get space X ipo news as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:36:52'] Is this purely hypothetical or has there been talk of him stepping down? Never mind just saw your other comments
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 07:53:09'] The Company? Will do just fine, CEOs aren't as important as people think, I would be more concerned if there was a mass Exodus of engineers and scientists.The stock? It's going down, the entire valuation is based on a cult surrounding Elon and very little else.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 22:52:23'] I imagine the faith in the company’s future decreases drastically. The bubble evaporates into thin air overnight. Tesla might even become undervalued briefly until faith in the new boss is established. But even then Tesla would not be what it is today in the public eye.Elon is a badass like that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 02:47:00'] Honestly it’ll be a down hill freight train to zero. Tesla isn’t profitable and without His Memeness it’ll collapse.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 22:17:22'] Tesla is no more.. Sell your shares .. Be thankful for the ride ..  No one has the vision.. He's hands down the best CEO of his company ..
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:34:06'] That's what they are building the Teslabot for.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 21:44:38'] TBH for the last 6 months it's already felt like he's been relatively absent and is spending most of his time on SpaceX. He doesn't do earnings calls anymore. However, Tesla has a great product that sells itself and it's already a top 5 US company by market cap. At this point they just need to execute on the scale up of vehicle manufacturing and maintain their 60% production growth rate. I can see Elon successfully playing the role of caretaker CEO while his capable subordinates are allowed focus on that task.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 23:22:55'] Nothing to worry about. After his death, he'll hook his brain up to a Tesla Bot with Neuralink and he'll be CEO for as long as he wants and then eventually retire on Mars
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 02:42:52'] Then someone else takes over and the business goes on its merry way.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 02:48:52'] I think it would immediatly crash to fail value as Elon has been the main driver of the hype.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 03:57:22'] If Elon steps down from Techno king of Tesla, which is his current title, then it will depend on who replaces him.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 04:35:43'] He can’t do it anytime soon, but within the next 5-10 years, if Tesla reaches their goals, it won’t be the deathblow that it is today. It would likely sting regardless, likely a red couple of days, but reality would set in. There was a time that you couldn’t see Apple without Steve JobsAmazon without Bezos And here we are. To be honest, Elon has begun to shift his time more and more to SpaceX/Starlink anyway. He won’t be on most of the calls unless it’s something super important. Tesla has probably its most “grown up” earnings call last quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 04:39:03'] I had a largely Tesla based portfolio for a while, it made me soooo much money but eventually I started thinking about what if he gets hit by a bus? Brain aneurysm?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 04:53:26'] I imagine the stock would sink a tad and then plateau. I believe Elon being the face of the company is a huge part of its valuation.

My best performing and worst performing stock happens to be Tesla which has way too much volatility. Today Elon says this, next day something caused -7% fall.  I reduced my position and will do so soon. I once held MSFT and INTC long ago, thinking like you. Bought around 2000. It took MSFT 16 years to recover.  With INTC I did not know they had more Pentium chips in the warehouse could not sell never disclosed.   Today not profitable again, live on government subsidized grant not by itself.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 18:59:07'] Fed is about to pivot in the coming months.   They will also start dumping bonds (this is called tightening).   Everybody wants bonds.  Bond market dwarfs the Stock Market,  its risk free, free money.   And when the Fed isn’t greedily hogging down all the bonds, it’s a lot of Risk-free Free Money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 17:08:54'] TBF my advice is to reinvest with stops that you incrementally move up as you get more in the money. The "recession" will never be made public until it's already happening (look at 2008-10) and there's seemingly no end to the free money, despite the fed raising rates little by little.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 17:12:17'] You can diversify your investments by choosing stocks in specific sectors, such as health care, resources, energy, etc., to ensure that your investments will grow steadily during a recession, and you can also invest in some real estate

POST_TEXT: b"Tesla Earnings\n\nTesla's earnings will be released later Wednesday. Analysts expect Tesla's earnings to be up 76 percent from a year ago and revenue to grow strongly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut demand concerns are mounting amid soaring production and a reduced backlog of orders. As a result, investors will be eager to comment on Tesla's deliveries in the fourth quarter and next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla shares rose a modest 0.4 percent to 200.19 on Tuesday, after rising to 229.75 in early trading. tesla shares hit a 15-month low on Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCEO Elon Musk may have additional reason to be bullish on Wednesday night's earnings call. Assuming the Twitter deal could close by Oct. 28, Musk may need to sell more Tesla shares in the coming days to help pay for the $44 billion acquisition. Some estimates suggest Musk may need to sell another $8 billion of TWTR stock."
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 01:24:02'] So just for verification.  If Elon buys twitter and sells tesla shares. That makes tesla stock go down quite a bit yea?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 23:06:32'] Is Tesla in the Dow Jones? Did it move there? No wonder the Dow Jones is so high up

POST_TEXT: b"I went through a lot of surveys on investing mistakes and compiled a list of the 5 most common ones. My input in this is the safeguards that I have in place that help me avoid these mistakes.\n\nAs human beings, we're facing all kinds of risks in our lives. Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.\n\nThink of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in). If we dissect this simple event, the risk comes from all the vehicles on the street and the safeguard is taking a look to make sure it is safe.\n\nNow, in the world of investing, there are plenty of risks, but not that many articles when it comes to safeguards. I hope that this post is helpful to some, so let's dive right into the 5 most common mistakes:\n\n# Mistake #1 Listening to others\n\nBuying or selling stocks based on someone's opinion is oftentimes a bad idea.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 10:51:44'] Thanks for this, very informative. Although I think getting other people's opinion on a stock in addition to your own DD isn't a bad idea
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 12:19:51'] Good list. Especially agree with keeping up on the 10-Q/10-Ks.I will break Rule #1 all day to listen to Peter Lynch's list of mistakes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isZA3G2Yk98
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 11:47:07'] It's a good start. Every one of those is true. There are a couple of big ones missing though, the first one is knowing where you're wrong. This could be a price or it could be an activity. This does not apply to indexes but it does to individual securities commodities or other investments. The second one is thinking about where you're going to get out. Both of these go through my head before I ever put on a trade. It took me about 7 years before I became profitable. Realizing where I'm wrong has probably been the single best skill along with not taking advice from people online. You might use what they say to do some research but going in blind? 90% of people who try to trade lose money. That means the comment you're reading has a high probability of being wrong if it's some type of call
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 16:20:31'] Can you give some tips on how you value a stock? I'm new to this and trying to get better at doing my own DD and valuations

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 18:31:53'] My biggest mistake was not taking profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 13:24:40'] I’d say selling low is a big one. People think they’re long-term investors, until a correction hits and they panic and sell for huge losses. Stock pickers change strategies and start investing in ETF’s when if they had just held their stocks and continue to DCA during the dip, they would have probably have out-performed the market (provided they pick are high quality companies). I’m convinced this is one of the two main reasons why retail has a hard time beating the market — selling low and trying to get rich quick.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 11:02:38'] From my own personal experience so far the biggest mistake i made in investing with most stocks is selling. i think Buy and Hold strategy for the long term is the best strategy for investing.if you hold a successful and profitable company's stock you should hold it as long as possible,
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 12:27:45'] You could name it like that, but, who on earth likes losses?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 18:39:37'] Big fan of the first mistake… bye…
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 19:53:34'] Nailed it. I am defo guilty of those mistakes myself.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 20:02:41'] Wrong. You can absolutely time the markets. I do it every day. You broke your first rule. Stop listening to news papers and media and book writers who are NOT successful traders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 20:12:47'] \#5 is a double-edged sword. I read an article about the best performing stock portfolios included investors who forgot their account passwords and others that died.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 01:24:59'] Depends who you are listening to, I've listened to a few well informed friends for the last 20 years and I have made more than i've lost.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:41:50'] Avoid Youtube videos like the plague.  Especially if the clown pimping stocks on the other end looks barely out of his 20s
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:49:03'] I have been doing pretty well in the last 2 years despite the shitshows in the market. I try not to read articles about my single stocks and only use un redacted breaking news straight through my broker.The more people interpret a news event the more likely someones bias got involved.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 03:48:44'] Thank You as person who has been closely following the market since the early 1980's. Read it and read it again. The market today is very tenuous. We could easily have Wiley Coyote moment this week or VERY soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 10:55:14'] Completely agreed to all of your 5 mistakes and want to add a 6th mistake, for me the most important one: Holding a stock even it falls below a certain treshold, for me it is a loss of 10 pc. It s way easier to compensate a missed uptick than you get your money back if a stock keeps falling
