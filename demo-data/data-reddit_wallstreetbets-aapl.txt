So at the same p/e ratio they will have to make 10B a quarter for stock to go up by 10%.\n\nWill AAPL rally like 2019 again??'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 01:26:53'] "aapl stock has been more or less flat for past 2 years"Which means it outperformed damn near every other tech stock over the same period. Being more or less flat these past few years is massive strength, not a sign it's overdue for a climb.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:21:12'] Do you think Apple has a chance of hitting 210-220 before their earnings in July? Apple is hitting resistance at the 180 mark. If it breaks that I can only assume we go to 200+. With all this news about AI I think Apple will break through and make new ATH

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 22:15:21'] I think it's a tossup whether this moves AAPL one direction or the other. I was overleveraged in AAPL calls when they had a major consumer event in summer 2021 and it was a big wet fart that moved the stock price from 135 to 134 or something (don't quote me, I don't remember the exact numbers).The market is about to hit a blow-off top right before the event. QQQ will be at 365, SPY will be at 430.If the market is still on its way up during that day, this could either be the catalyst for another leg for the whole market to jump another 2% before taking a major pullback, or it could be the exact crest of the wave before we head back to SPY 413. Or it could literally be nothing meaningful to anyone. Have fun.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 05:19:13'] My theory is Apple has been using Siri to build AI database for the past however many years since they released her and has been sitting on a perfect AI system for the past several months and are going to drop it along with their new VR headset.

Not saying the price wont go up short term but if it does it might be because of all or none of these reasons. None of these are market moving phenomena and the odds are they’re already priced in.

Given the company's history of releasing groundbreaking products that have led to substantial stock price increases, there may be market interest in purchasing Apple call options in anticipation of a potential rise in the company's stock price following the announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 16:27:14'] I’m genuinely worried they think they’re too cool to make the entire event all about ai and they’ll drop 50% until Tim Apple makes an ai-pology.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 16:04:27'] Now Meta announced their own headset which sounds like it will be priced about $2600 less than Apple’s. Maybe trying to trump Tim Apple’s release?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:54:44'] I’m no Apple fan boy but I enjoy some of their products and can easily admit this looks like a great iteration of a VR headset...but that price though.It’s a given that they are aware their initial market will be highly limited. But if VR/metaverse does have life, it will probably stem from a slow expansion of this product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:45:45'] (almost) Everyone's laughing at AAPL now, for the price tag... But you realise it's effectively got a MacBook Pro built in ... This thing is capable of serious processing power locally, that can drive high quality simulation/AR ... There are markets for it right now, and as the price/power stats trend down and up, it _will_ create new markets... Including 18+ ones. Apple had never been afraid of innovation at a high price point (original Apple ][, Mac, LaserWriter etc) and only lowers cost of entry as they're adopted. Caveat: being the first generation, and from Apple, it _will_ have some fundamental flaw or limitation that stops it being universally adopted, and you might want to wait until gen2 or gen3 before you spend your own money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:40:12'] Apples number one existential threat is AR. There is absolutely no chance in 40 years everyone is using touch phones and devices - we will all have AR rendered interfaces that’ll be more convenient than carrying around a MacBook, iPad, and iPhone.  It seems if the product works as advertised they are leading in AR as a replacement to devices. They are making a Tesla roadster entry to the market and I find it impressive and demonstrating they have actual IP and innovation here (if working as advertised). It will just take a few generations to get the form factor and price worked out enough to be mainstream. But it is the best I’ve seen so far. I will buy one and see if it lives up to marketing

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 12:03:26'] There’s one simple reason they keep pushing this crap. Market research hubris. Supposedly Apple’s good at market research, I assume analysts are thinking the same.But testing products in California then saying the other 95% of the US wants a piece is a huge overestimate. Smartphones made sense the market was built already by blackberry. But this headband. The prior market is porn, fringe gamers (saturated), and support businesses (which cycle through architectures every 6 months).There’s going to be practically zero adaptation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:15:12'] I remember going to Best Buy with my dad in the early 90’s we were finally going to get a PC for our home. Everyone was dialing up to America online. I was so excited he was getting our family a PC for Christmas. Now mind you back then computer hardware was expensive I believe we got a windows PC manufactured by IBM or I don’t remember the brand but yeah that computer for our family was the first one we ever had for the household. It cost my dad like over $3k at Best Buy back then. I remember thinking computers were so expensive. Obviously over the years computers have gotten more affordable and powerful. Heck you can go to wal mart now and by a new PC for like $200 bucks. Wasn’t like that back then. I am thinking this product hardware and tech from apple is going to be expensive for many but over time the tech will get more affordable, versatile and ubiquitous with consumers.

Your screenshot doesn't appear to be your executed close figures. That's understandable, and that's why my math is approximate based on the screenshot.600 contracts \* 100 shares per contract \* $0.81 average cost = $48,600 buy in.$76,800 market value - $48,600 buy in = $28,200 net profit! (before broker fees on both sides if any)Your Walmart option from May 2022 was huger! 475% return on a \~$10k buy in. Woo!

Zillow's estimate is that the house is worth $513,800.  It last sold nine years ago for $176K. To be fair, when that house was built, it was on the westernmost part of Miami, abutting the Everglades, and Miami was not the city that it is today.  These days, there are close to a million people living west of this house and Miami is an "it" city.  Clearly the game is to buy property in an up-and-coming city.

Everyone thought it's going to be a fad and destined to fail like MSFT's Windows Phone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 04:49:05'] There is no doubt that Nolan Bushnell made the right decision when he turned down Steve Jobs' offer of a third of Apple at $50,000. While it is true that Apple went on to become one of the most successful companies in history, there is no guarantee that this would have been the case if Bushnell had taken Jobs up on his offer. In fact, it is quite possible that things could have turned out very differently for both men if they had gone down different paths.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 11:19:12'] Remember they were competitors. The Atari home computer (400 and 800) were their game console with a keyboard added.  Atari was the first to sell their computer in a retail chain - Sears. Sears, not knowing what the thing was, sold it in its home appliance department along with the Kenmore vacuum cleaners, blenders, Little Mac hamburger cookers, and ironing boards.  The sales people had no training and not a clue how it worked. They could not demo them.  So they sat there with lovely cardboard signage turned off.Bushnell would have been dumb to support a competitor. Atari was bought by Waner Communications in 1976. They sold it to Jack Tramiel of Commodore fame in 1984. People look at personal computers as something that has always been around and has clear value. Not so at all. In the beginning you could not give them away. No one had a clue why you would want one. Hell the handheld calculator had just come out and people struggled adopting it.  The learning curve was steep; the software buggy.  The memory was so small you couldn't do much.  Then came the Visicalc spreadsheet. The first "killer app".  It allowed middle management to do REAL work every day and being middle management could sign off on the expense - which was SUBSTANTIAL for a real computer, keyboard, printer, terminal (or monitor) and floppy disk drives.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 12:10:22'] Creator of Diablo game, David Brevik, was offered a portion of what would become Hotmail for a desk to work on. Since they were crunching towards game release he refused. As per wiki: In 2016, Brevik revealed that he was once approached by Sabeer Bhatia in 1996 to form an email company in which he will get 10% of the shares. Brevik flatly rejected the offer, thinking it was the "stupidest idea." 14 months later, when the company, later known as Hotmail, sold for $400 million, Brevik expressed his regret over that decision, calling it the "worst business decision of my entire career."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VscdPA6sUkc&t=2033s&ab_channel=GDC The man himself talking about it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 20:55:21'] This shouldnt be taken as anything more than one piece of information on a fairly ordinary day of trading AAPL.\~40% of market volume is done via dark pools.  [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp#citation-17)  You can read more about dark pools more generally there.  They are not illegal, even though dark sounds scary, they are a normal part of daily market function.  Many times, its just pensions or buy side institutions looking to not disturb the markets.  On this day..  AAPL had:AAPL Off Exchange & Dark Pool Summary  Today's Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume is 30,672,965, which is 46.93% of today's total volume.  Today's Lit volume is 34,686,800, which is 53.07%.  Over the past 30 days, the average Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume has been 42.84%.  The average Lit volume has been 57.16%. [Source](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-aapl/exchange-volume/)It was a slightly higher day in off exchange / dark pool volume, relative to the average daily volume.  This particular trade accounted for \~13% of daily volume.  Its large.  But it is not uncommon.  TLDR  Take this with a grain of salt amongst all the other things you take into account when making a trade.  Or not, just smash the call button on your personal gambling device. ....yes there are controversies surrounding off exchange trading on "unlit" markets.  I encourage you to educate yourself.  Find others that share your beliefs and organize.  Its not to hard to find the folks addressing these issues if thats what you are into.

I am not saying that the market will not go down, but of all the companies you have chosen to short one of the stablest. This will walk over you and steam-roll you until you become bidimensional.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 15:39:11'] Apple is up .50 cents after hours, that’s nothing to surprising.  Lulu is up $43 after hours because of good 1st quarter results.  Will probably do well 2nd quarter as people are still living an inflated standard of living by hammering credit cards.  Those credit cards will only last a few more months before they are tapped out and people can’t refi their home to get more cash.  I would say the effects will show up in 4th quarter 2023 2nd quarter 2024.  At which point we will see these jumps turn into dips.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 18:28:40'] Apple fucks so hard that it will eventually solve the obesity crisis by getting in the business of selling actual fruit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 19:04:29'] Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, "What goes up must come down". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to "try it out"? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate "a new world". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *"once given, it's hard to go back"*.Overall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand. Overall, Apple is a strong company, but must be wary of this overly positive market when there's a lot of downside risk to it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 18:17:16'] >There are a few reasons for my belief that Apple will continue to rise in the short term. First, Apple is a very innovative company and consistently releases new products that consumers love. This keeps people interested in the brand and drives up sales. Additionally, Apple has a strong financial position with lots of cash on hand to invest in new initiatives or weather any storms that come its way. Finally, consumer confidence in the company remains high despite some recent controversies, meaning people are still willing to buy its products.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 20:26:13'] It isn't just AAPL, it's this current "hot asf" thing everyone is spamming called AI. If it's tech it must inevitably have to utilize AI in some form or another SOON just to stay half ass solvent. When dumb dumb investors, be them big or small, find out AI isn't really anything "new" or "exotic" or revolutionary the money is going to fizzle, the ERs are going to be dismal and we'll all patiently wait for whatever "It" thing comes next. This year it's AI, next year could be vegan foods, or completely dead clothing retailers, or lean hogs or whatever nonsense the richer MMs decide to play with.Ride it while it's hot though

POST_TEXT: b'Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apples returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isnt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. \n\nAs the worlds leading consumer products and technology company, Apples earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? \n\nHeres what analysts think:\n\n* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)\n\n* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv\n\nRevenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isnt great, but also not terrible. Something I dont often see mentioned about Apple is'

The squirrel that lives outside of my garage got lost under my shelves, and when he made it out I found an apple in our small entryway pond. It was rotten and slowly sinking. All the sign I need!Edit: EPS (before buybacks) = Negative yoy, revenue: FLAT. Once analysts realize that Apple is just using their massive buybacks as a way of hiding their sliding earnings per share the Squirrrel will have his revenge.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 12:50:48'] As you write the negative expectations are there and probably already priced in. I therefore do not expect any significant change in stock price at first. But in the mid to long term these figures have the ability to turn market sentiment, because with a company so large and premium they give the best estimate of the purchasing strength of the consumer right now. So watch for the indices, I expect the real reaction to be there.

Especially these days where there’s exponentially more options trading than ever before, and most block trades never see the light of day on a lit exchange. You can be sure that if there is some institutional selling it probably won’t be AAPL, and if for some unbeknownst reason it is, it’ll be an arbitrage opportunity in a dark pool somewhere and it’ll hit the tape outside of retail hours.God speed regard.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 20:54:09'] I know my Title is SHiT but really though..What I found worth sharing was the concept of Apple via Apple Pay and Apple Cards mixing rewards systems and banking with above par APR/APY. This could get a freak flood  from crap banks and unbanked into iphone as a bank. Making overnight, Apple one of the biggest most integrated and well accepted fintech payments processor.that is some heavy stuff looking long from here, not to be overhype, but it could be a 2-7yr multiX price vs share with forward splits expected, potential spinoff and massive uptick in cash volume plus user/fee base. It's crazy enough for a movie plot.IRL, I use android because I don't like having a phone master i have to pay for my own shit. Trade wise, fk it, near term volatility is profit, and obvious growth long is easy value.\*\*edit, derped out and forgot extended contextGoldman Sachs is doing the banking for Apple, Goldman just announced step back from retail/consumer banking. It is almost conspiracy good timing for the perfect bridge to shadow bank it. Which could lead to customer and holdings increase beyond the massive volume and fees implied on all sides.Interesting times. \*\*endedit Just my 2 crayons.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 17:13:33'] These Apple wrapped financial services are just shit. When things go bad and you look for customer service these two parties will just kick balls back and forth until you get CFPB involved. Gotta stay away from this shit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 11:32:57'] I would recommend selling your AAPL $160 put + $0.28 VV m/1 1D 1W 1M 3M 1Y position at the current market price of $17,080.00. The current AAPL price is above your breakeven point, so you are likely to experience a loss if you hold onto the position until expiration.

At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.\n\nHowever, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.\n\nFinally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay t"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 20:20:45'] Seems like most earnings this season reflect a YoY decline, I feel like its expected given the economic climate. People are going to look to still invest though, especially in companies they know will weather the storm

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 17:56:52'] Puts on Apple before earnings is usually a bad idea. All they gotta do is mention share buy backs and your fucked ![img](emote|t5_2th52|30641) last quarter results came back bad and I thought my puts would print yet they mentioned share buybacks and fucked me hard. All I could say was “daddy chill”
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 17:04:51'] I  yolo’d on 5/12 $190 calls.  They didn’t have layoffs
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 17:18:06'] Apple is likely to beat even when others miss, but when other names are beating and gapping up, apple is as close to a sure thing as you can get. Even if it dips into earnings, it will end next week higher than it is now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 18:15:56'] There's something so wrong with your approach to trading in your first sentences. It keeps going up, so annoying, like wtf.. If you made this observation to yourself earlier, and I'm sure you have, why are you not just long, at any price ? The Nasdaq is up 22℅ in 2023 you are literally in a bull market, whatever the doomers finance influencers can post to create short interest and make the market keep going up by doing so. You should use this weekend to think about it. There are dozens of stocks listed on the Nasdaq that are down 95% and are going to bankruptcy, while pretty much only the megacaps are pumping, and your strategy to try to make money is.. Betting against one of the best megacap out there, that you think is going up only? Shouldn't you be looking for the worst of the worst companies you can find if you want to play inverse investor?.. Hope it helps
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 20:00:41'] If they so much as mention AI it's ATH. Apple doesn't miss and if they miss the stock still goes up.

POST_TEXT: b"Hello everyone! I have been a lurker on the sub for a few months and want to post about a small position I am taking and I am sure many others are. Tech companies like META and MSFT beat earnings and their stock prices spiked after. I see an opportunity with MSFT earnings coming out first, them beating earnings, and their stock price blowing up, followed by the same thing happening with META a day later. I feel like the market should've priced this in because they are in the same industry, but it still happened so I feel AAPL has a chance to do the same. \n\nHere's my position and reasoning. I bought 10 call contracts with a strike of $190 expiring 5/5. The IV is 38.18% and my breakeven is $190.04. I feel if AAPL beats earnings the same way its competitors did, it will see a similar jump in share price. Yes, Q1 revenue was down 5% compared to the previous year while MSFT was up 11% over the same period of time. I feel this provides more upside potential for AAPL if they beat earnings.\n\nI"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 09:20:07'] A lot of what meta and msft do is b2b, whereas aapl is almost all b2c so i don't know if you can really connect the two. 190 would also be a new ATH for aapl, that's kind of asking for a lot in this economy. I could be wrong, good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 10:00:04'] there was some other regard on here last night going on about aapl 120 p for feb.  I would watch in the short term if it hits 153 your puts are not in line with the trend, 136 and your still on line for some nice tendies. That strike date is too short tbh and I will say theta may eat your ass, but I like weeklys so I know your risk profile.  I'm starting to see a trend where people are right but the timeline doesn't allow for the full maximization of pulling tendies.  God speed and have a nice mid life crisis explaining to the wife you yoloed 100k on some chinese foxxconn employees not trying to kill themselves and protesting instead, oh and what if china opens up like the mkt is pricing in?&#x200B;That being said with that delta and your timeframe you can grab 170% profits on your breakeven of 141 and upside to 136 in the short term is \~210% honestly puts suck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 04:36:12'] Ok, I don't comment a lot on markets/stocks on Reddit as a HF a manager but this popped into my feed so.....The reason $AAPL is going up is the Fed. Tech assets have duration risk with inflation (future cash flows get discounted if rates move up). If we are starting to see rates drop in the future (Powell signaled this) then tech will likely get some tailwind behind it. You are also running up against seasonality here.(I am on the other side of your trade). Perhaps you will be right and profit, or maybe I will - the great game continues.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 08:39:20'] It is clear that the market is heading up. I would recommend buying APL, CVP, and AND III at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 08:39:54'] Buyers at 164, sellers at 166 and heavy at 167. Might just sit range bound here for the day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 18:53:14'] Do you have any success with book map? I just randomly subscribed a couple of days ago and used it to scalp NVDA and was surprised to see how much more data you get than TOS’s Level 2. Wish you could place trades directly on it though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:24:43'] I think the market in general will open negative tomorrow. Even a decent chance of loosing all the gains today.But really it wasn't catastrophic news for any of the companies. Just a natural result of an economy slowing down. Apple shit is overpriced anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:44:59'] I think some people bought today just picking back up the shares they sold for loss before the end of the year. Well that applies to AMZN and Google. Apple is whole different thing that have different dynamics. I don't follow em that close any more. I don't own any of them. My last position in Apple I sold 4 yrs ago.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 05:33:24'] The earnings were terrible. Every person with ape brain opened short, so the market will short squeeze even higher. Then we go to new lows once enough idiots close and others buy top. Or we crash today. Who knows.

Jokes apart everything is sitting at a breakout point for bull run or sitting at false breakout ready for bear run. So I will go by the day to make calls or puts..
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:34:38'] They were green in the aftermarket. First they were bleeding red, then recovered.Probably depends on analysts' recommendations, upgrades/downgrades and new price targets.I think that all will end up down this week but maybe not at the open.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 21:03:40'] Idk but I need AMZN and Google both to have a solid day. Happy to add more shares if it dips though 🤷‍♂️

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 06:49:57'] I don't have a dog in the fight, but I'm just gonna put a quote from your article right here:>Apple's overall sales fell 4.4% year-on-year, *broadly outperforming the market downturn.*
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 18:25:56'] Apples buisness model has been to slightly improve the camera on their phone and convince people to spend a thousand dollars and it still works for some reason
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 06:54:39'] Apple’s manufacturing infrastructure is very well distributed.  During China’s bout of civil disputes I looked up each part and assembly process there are places around the world.  Some are smaller operations that are basically on standby to scale up quickly if needed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 09:24:03'] If Apples AirPods were a business in of itself it would be the 32nd largest business in the US. Now couple that with their free cash flow. Apple is absolutely prepared to create and innovate more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 12:48:50'] That’s because Apple moved majority of its manufacturing out of CHINAAAAA
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:51:23'] Are you witnessing what Verizon is pitching? It's $25.00 a line.  A fixed term of 3 years. Just bring your own phones (from Walmart, Ebay, or Goodwill, or the dumpster at Wendy's).They're not stupid. They're thinking out  half a decade. Locking up lines of cashflow...and it doesn't need to be a $1,500 phone from Apple. Why? Because who can afford that level of status.  The "Bonfire of the Vanity's" (for conspicuous phone consumption) is dead.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 14:39:45'] Apple is not the only smartphone manufacturer using Chinese factories and they have stronger brand loyalty, and a much larger cult than any of the others.Unless Apple themselves are reporting less shipments this means nothing.Edit: called it, Apple lost some sales but far less than the others.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 17:43:11'] How does it relate to production numbers? How much of those production numbers are direct consequences of COVID lockdowns throughout the year?How much of that production has shifted to both India and Vietnam?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 17:54:19'] I think this is one of the reasons Apple is trying to spin out new products. The VR stuff, the project Titan EV (that always gets pushed back), and trying to turn the Apple watch into this medical device, and then the payment system + their credit card. But buying LEAPs between Microsoft and Apple rarely hurts.

It means the market has a lot lower to go. \n\nRates are NOT going down in 2023 so you can kiss the secular bull market goodbye.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:07:06'] If I buy it at $60 the bottom is $30.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:35:44'] AAPL's at 21 times PE, mid to high single-digit growth annually for the foreseeable future, and improving margins as subscription growth continues, paired with a monster 100B buyback and growing dividend... It ain't a bargin, but there's a reason Buffet likes it

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 11:54:10'] Yes a company making $128 billion annually in operating profits and growing by double digits will fall to a $800 billion market cap despite the $100 billion buy backs. Sorry but kiss those puts goodbye
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:30:37'] 90 dollars I can believe but 60 not so much. And the fed won’t cut rates but they can step down and stop increasing rates which is also good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 21:22:50'] If you think Bogleheads will get rekt in 2023 then you miss the point of being a Boglehead.  Bogleheads don't care about 2023.  If they do, they already sold out of risky equities a few years ago.   But you could be right about AAPL going down more.  I don't really know what to expect in 2023.  My best guess is a wild ride to end up close to flat by year end.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 11:20:52'] Ah yes, Apple, a company with $50 billion in cash on hand and steadily increasing revenue and profit margins while the world burns should not be valued so high 😡
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 17:13:02'] AAPL at $60 is the dumbest shit I’ve heard
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:52:21'] Since we are in WSB, seeing all of these comments calling OP regarded and the upvotes given to said comments makes me believe that OP is correct.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:05:30'] >I completely agree. Apple is absurdly overvalued and the market will not bottom until it falls significantly in value. I would recommend tactical asset allocation and opportunistic gambling as the best way to profit from this situation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:18:54'] AAPL is holding because of many reasons. Here are some random ones I can think of:1. Their physical goods and raw materials literally have intrinsic value (like gold etc). When war broke out, ppl in affected countries bought apple products hoping to resell later in a bid to retain their falling currency value. Countries less affected by world economy are still consuming apple products.2. Their revenue is diversified across hardware, software and services. (Unlike Meta and Google that are heavily reliant on only ad revenue as their main income source).3. They don’t spend money recklessly, or yolo into something just because hype (eg. Metaverse), but focus on their fundamentals in delivering quality products.4. As a result are actually profitable unlike the other big tech. Look at their quarterly reports, still posting profits despite interest rates hike and supply issues, showing resilience year after year.5. Apple has resources to buyback heavily if it falls more, heck, institutions and investors will probably buy them back before letting it fall further.Wait all you want but AAPL will never fall to $60. I’m willing to bet with you if it falls to $60, mods can ban my account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 16:41:11'] amen
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:53:13'] Aapl bad earnings would tank the market. Maybe by spy puts same week
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:20:10'] As much as I like apple and buy the latest iPhones lake a dumbass every fukking time, op’s statement is valid in my opinion. Apple is at the end of the day, yet another tech stock(with high af liquidity) that hasn’t seen a price adjustment relative to the market. Going to 60…? Idunno abt that but if y’all’s are shorting spy u might want to take into acct the fucking 6% APPL makes up in that etf lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:04:42'] I have a few long shorts I took out ~3 months ago on Apple with a strike price of $75. They expire at the end of January, may need to roll them out a few more months because I agree. Apple is massively overvalued and has produced little to nothing in terms of innovation since 2008. The real question is why it is still trading so high at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 21:20:26'] So many people here hating on OP just cuz apple is "safe heaven". But do please tell me what happened with  2021 bulletproof stonk that "cannot go down" called amazon?. Apple is bought mostly by morons that need to be flashing their newest bestest iphone, watch and earpods. If the same people will loose jobs how will they be able.to afford this stuff?? Tech industry will be the first one that will turn on layoff printer. The whole spy can go down to 300 and less if we will get recession so how apple can be safe when at the end of day it is still stonk?? Buffet is buying cuz what else can he buy?? He cannot buy more than 50% of OXY so what to do with all of his money?

It’s gonna go down and institutional investors are gonna rug the fuck outta apple
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 16:31:45'] I’ve sold puts exercising at 129 with an expectation price could hit 90-100. If AAPL drops below 100 I’ll take a fucking second mortgage out to buy those bags.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:51:47'] Their P/E is beyond reasonable, how the fuck can you compare them to TSLA? Small brained post understands nothing. Here’s a hint, rising rates impact businesses that rely on free or very cheap money to operate, not behemoths like AAPL that have more than 10 years of their entire operating costs in fucking cash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:19:40'] P/E is 20. SPY is 40. What makes you think they’ll drop to p/e of 10?I haven’t looked at their balance sheet in awhile but don’t they have a lot of cash on hand? I don’t think rate changes affect them as much as other companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 11:43:55'] apple is a cash making machinelearn to read financial stuff
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 11:22:56'] if you actually believe this will happen you can just buy AAPD and stop worrying about "tactical asset allocation"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 15:33:07'] /u/Degenereth if you want to see some real overvalued stocks as well look into MCD, LLY, TMUS, and even SBUX. ADSK is pretty overvalued too. HSY and KO are some really overvalued names too. I have a screener I run on finviz to scan for stuff like this. Everyone says blindly buy defensives/healthcare into a recession which has created a little bubble in these names. I think some stocks will be okay next year but we are not close to a market wide bottom due to these pockets of overvaluation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:10:26'] I think we're in for an absolutely face melting sell off going into January 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:31:38'] I actually agree but I'm looking for $100 for aapl to mark the bottom, it's gotta die for the market to heal.Also if buffett dies that's an instant 20% haircut
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:13:32'] I think the opposite. Apple is the safe spot. When the bottom hits apple will drop like a rock when people move their money into better growth stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:04:18'] What’s the deal with these aggressive hyper bear posts?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:45:22'] Oh boy ! I will love some apple at $60 @ 100,000 shares , and then patiently wait to retire
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:03:15'] I agree.  Apple is next.  And soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:32:25'] APPL $60 means World War3![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:12:10'] Ah yes of course the biggest stock in the world is going to decline more than 60%, that’s some brilliant analysis.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 11:16:27'] Very unlikely. I’d say 90 is going to be a very hard barrier to break.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:33:28'] And you, u/Degenereth, are smarter than all these stupid people buying and holding AAPL, yes?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:14:44'] Tell Warren Buffett he’s an idiot for buying and holding Apple 🤣
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 15:04:51'] I’ve posted about this before but I’ve done some math using P/S, P/E, and P/FCF around Apple. Assuming a 10% revenue drop (JPM now projecting 6% for this quarter alone) I’d say it should be around $60 based on 2016 valuations (the last time it had a revenue drop, ~7%). But due to how much cash they’ve spent and debt they’ve gone into to buy back their own shares, I’d say it should be $50 at most, probably lower.If Tesla’s growth remains decently high throughout next year, Apple is unironically more overvalued than Tesla which is a sentence that is wild to type out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 10:23:30'] Wtf
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:23:43'] 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂…love my Apple stocks, have had faith in the company since the early days - they made me rich, and continue to do so…
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:31:15'] Don’t they have $400B revenue a year? That’s with a B….. $2T market cap seems low to me.  Cash flow is king and AAPL has the most of any company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 17:14:19'] it'll fall further when institutions run out of money to hedge with PUTs or CCs. that's literally what kept AAPL high.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:32:15'] I wish but it can’t go to 60 sadly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 15:24:16'] How do you like them apples?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 17:28:42'] Why are we assuming AAPL and S&P 500 will bottom at the same time?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:46:05'] You forget their massive buybacks over the years
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 16:06:21'] Aapl is a a relatively low risk investment and still growing so i see no reason for someone with long term mentality not to own this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 19:47:37'] Apple valuation is not that crazy. P/S is high but h they're very profitable and a P/E of 16 and 20 P/Net Profit is not crazy.TSLA has to fall another almost 50% to arrive at these numbers and has contracting margins which will make it 70+%
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:31:03'] “I recommend tactical asset allocation and opportunistic gambling”Wait are people not doing this?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:34:22'] Is it your view that earnings will implode? Or will we go back to trading at a PE of 8 or 9?  $60 will have us at a 9 handle unless earnings implode.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 11:24:08'] Okay. But it’s P/E is around 25. It has a huge fan base. Name recognition. Occasional new products that are heavily copied. The App Store. iTunes. And is probably the largest stock in most people’s retirement accounts (through ETFs). I don’t own Apple stock and have never bought any of their products, but fundamentally…what’s the issue? Relatively weak iPhone sales aren’t gonna kill it and fanbois will skip meals to save up for Apple products during a recession.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 13:26:22']  💀it’s the supply that is getting wiped out Chinese analyst is regarded
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 16:55:58'] Most of the demand is driven by these insane trade-in deals. In what world is 3-4 year old iPhones worth $1k? But once people upgrade, they are stuck for 2-3 years with it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 17:15:30'] "Chinese analyst" doesn't do Ming-chi Kuo justice. He is one of the top analysts studying Apple's supply chain and has a really solid track record.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 14:33:24'] Ming is one of the top Apple Analysts out there. So yikes!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 03:18:54'] Man i have this phone and IT fucking sucks. Battery life doesn’t even last a full 24 hours abd is heavy as a brick. Will certainly sell and revert back to iphone 13. Anyone want a purple piece of  shit?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 18:15:20'] I think we retest $130ish fairly soon.  I hope I’m wrong!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 14:21:28'] Looks like chinese analyst is better than $AAPL's top management.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 19:09:28'] The 14 pro has been absolutely amazing for me especially coming from the XS. My parents got regular 14s and holy shit that's the real mistake Apple made
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 16:34:18'] Considering apple is openly supporting the suppression of free speech and has clearly cast it's lot on the wrong horse,this only seems natural. Puts on AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 15:49:14'] This guy smoking crack?Demand is high, supply is what’s wiped out silly goose.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 18:58:58'] Sounds like he’s been smoking crack. Confirmed:“During a recession, I believe that most of the demand for the iPhone 14 Pro series in 4Q22 will be wiped out rather than delayed due to a significant supply-demand gap.”So his theory is that because supply is constrained (for various reasons), demand will somehow be wiped out. Right. Crack for sure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 13:52:00'] Alugy is what I spit in this "analyst's" direction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 17:01:10'] I can’t wait to hear about how this Chinese analyst see the demand for dog and cat flesh to plummet too because their population is being held in confinement camps. Fuck off op.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 16:14:25'] I see what he did there
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 18:46:41'] Puts for the win
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 03:07:46'] What if there is no enough demand and they are doing this theater play to hide demand lost??? Conspiracy theory

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 07:38:55'] *analyst likes to do acid too often
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 09:13:50'] I see an analyst is making the classic mistake of assuming people will be rational and just decide not to upgrade their smart phone when it isn't a big deal to be behind. However what they will do is just cut in other places because no way they arn't getting the new phone.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:51:43'] Technically you need two closes below the 200 weekly to make a call on breaking support. I haven’t seen this yet with AAPL

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 20:38:46'] The Foxcon facility has gone down several times from Covid issues. If it doesn’t catchup with them this quarterly result, it’s a blood bath at the next one. Google just announced layoffs and Apple is the last of the big players, so I imagine that’s coming as well. If you need another indicator that’s not good for Apple, check out the savings rates for American consumers as it is dipping lower than pre-pandemic 2020 levels.

So Apple is going to lose millions of potential customers this year (as the big two are not going to be hustling new phone finance "deals" this year).My guess the large institutions and family offices that hold APPL will sell off any good earnings news this week.My view...and I'm sticking to it.

Plenty of money to educate yourself with books + whatever else, discords suck but some actually provide value if you find the right one. Me personally I like Vincent Desiuno. But the rest of youre money can be used to trade and make a full blown living.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 14:14:07'] Insider trading makes it really easy
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 09:04:08'] Nancy pelosi is a scum bag!! She’s horrible
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 14:27:13'] It's too early to call May 24th the bottom.  And are you going to point out all of her misses, too?  I guess those don't help your wild conspiracy theories.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 14:02:31'] To be fair, that’s the exact day I bought into Apple and Meta stock. Why? Because that’s the day that tech stocks generally tanked because of Snap’s revised guidance and announcement that they’ll be making less revenue than expected.It was clear to a lot of people that the stock price dropping for companies like Apple, who have huge cash reserves and are very profitable, and tanking only because of a revision of Snap’s profits, had clearly made companies like Apple a value stock. Same with Meta, same with Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 17:52:18'] Remember her RBLX calls? Just down 90%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 08:43:17'] Yeah,  We all know how corrupt Pelosi and her husband are, as well as the rest of the democratic left. And Republicans are no exception either. They all scam the American public and reap in in millions while we all pay for it.When  Will they drain the swamp and put in term limits. DOJ FBI most government offices have become corrupt and 90% of politicians in congress should be in prison
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 15:24:18'] Lol at the people defending Pelosi in these comments

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 17:45:38'] Certainly look at her husband's investments during bailout. This falls into insider trading covered quite clearly under SEC rules. How much money has the Biden crime family pocketed from Ukraine and China. I'll make it simple corruption is a crime.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 20:27:55'] Yeah I followed her into CRM, Roblox, etc and lost sooo although she is good she isn’t an oracle

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 22:28:13'] I mean I doubt shes sitting with Trading View open on her laptop all day. Probably has a broker at Citadel. Am I defending her? Hell no. Red or Blue all politicians are insider trading. But I just really doubt she's making her own trades on her iphone all day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 22:34:47'] Real question is would you have sex and follow anything Pelosi tells you to do, in order to be a half decent trader?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 15:19:06'] Jamie Dimon said the bottom is in. I heard him on Cramer/CNBC.That's his way of saying "Bide pressured me to buy a bunch of stocks and make the market go up" but we know the reality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 17:25:44'] I also nailed the 'exact' bottom when I rebought during covid. I was within cents of the bottom, within a 5 min window probably.But I'm just a retard who started pumping all my savings into stocks when they got to around -60%

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 18:26:48'] I really don’t think he wants completely out. He wants to negotiate a better deal… and find out the fair amount of “real “ accounts

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 19:56:22'] Maybe people are fallowing her trades because she is so good at manipulat….. market projections. She is 500 years old & has been doing this for a very long time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 21:15:32'] I don’t think any decision makers in government should be able to own individual stocks. That being said, she’s married to a hedge fund manager and reports his personal trades too because they’re married. I honestly don’t know if most people know that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 21:32:36'] Pelosi would probably be a good trader, even without access to insider information

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 04:11:39'] Hammer/piv-point plus a bullish engulfing candles with a retest of support. You don't need to be an insider or algo to see that. Plus that isn't the bottom, it's going to be much further down than that. Not saying Pelosi is not an insider trader, but this was just a good trade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 04:51:31'] The bottom *so far*

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 08:52:46'] Why is the tweet showing the NASDAQ graph first of all?If the calls were for Microsoft and Apple, then only the Microsoft and Apple graphs are relevant. They could be up while NASDAQ is down (and the opposite could be true as well). And then, why is the line pointing to 11,079 on the NASDAQ graph? NASDAQ's lowest that day was 11,092.Seems to me that the tweet tried to distortion the actual facts just to audience purposes. Nonetheless, great timing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 11:55:58'] Does it bother apes more that she timed a bottom or that she bought mainstream, money printing big cap stocks instead of some money losing meme stock?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 11:59:06'] There were allegations of insider trading that happened before the pandemic was announced.  >Yesterday's Wall Street Journal report added, "Investigators have obtained evidence that shows Mr. Burr was talking to people with specific insight about the threats posed by Covid-19 whose thinking wasn't available to the public, according to people familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors are now examining whether the wide latitude granted to lawmakers under the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution would limit their ability to win any insider-trading trial against Mr. Burr, the people said."They are all in on it.  You can't place blame on Pelosi alone.  [Source](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/four-senators-were-accused-insider-trading-three-are-clear-n1215381)

They didn’t execute until later in the day when aapl was soaring. I forgot to change them. Woke up this morning and panicked a bit when I saw the trade confirmation. I sold for a nice and tidy 350%+ profit this morning shortly after open.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:18:17'] more bearish stuff, they have high forex exposure and strong dollar will fuck them over. Last ER they blames exchange rate, they can do the same again. It’s definitely not the apple product price cuts and sales they are doing in China that’s hurting margins. the average Chinese citizen needs no incentive and is flocking to buy an inferior spec phone in comparison to the Chinese phones with dual fucking chips is what apple is trying to convince US share holders. Heck they haven’t even provided guidance since covid yet people still view it as a “safe” company. The only reason the stock hadn’t collapse is share buy backs which is also why EPS is still strong because there’s less shares on the market…. Apple is a ticking time bomb the way they are burning their cash reserves to prop up stock price. If they run out of cash it dooms the company, if they stop buy backs it’ll doom the share price. One is short term demolition but survival at the end the other is permanent demolition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:59:51'] Really don't get the apple selling point beside it being a ridiculously well run company. Pixel 7 > iphone. As do Samsung's flagships imho. Ipads feel outdated to me, but suppose there's a market here. Chromebooks and ultrabooks are just so much better for almost all kinds of use than apple alternatives. Earpods are absolute crap compared to alternatives. Apple watch is neat, but the competition is equally good, and garmin is miles better if you are in any way active. Apple atm are just products bought due to eco system and the idea it's a statement product.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 17:34:31'] Your Bullet point 2 delivers the needed defense of AAPL. I’m pretty sure the sun is coming up tomorrow…I’m just not positive. In this market looking at your scoreboard in #2, I could have been a hell of a lot of uglier places. AAPL has massive cash position, as I use my crayon to pen this missive, their buyback program makes sense, and new N3 chip in upcoming iPhone 15 with new satellite antenna that will be critical. The “older refurbished” argument doesn’t hold in a satellite based phone reality up in 5G. WB and CM didn’t fall off the turnip truck yesterday. Good trading🙏🏻

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 22:03:27'] I don't have much to say about it except for the design part which was invented by car companies that sold slightly better sometimes even same quality cars in different colors to create a market that leads people to buy a new car more often than needed. apple does it with round and sharp edges on their phones, car companies did it with different colors etc. There is a whole psychology about creating demand for something on a yearly basis that doesn't need to be changed every year and apple does it best. it's still the most popular phone amongst young people by far and more people want iphones even though it doesn't seem like it. don't have much to say about the rest but it's not stagnant or declining, it's rising ever so slightly. they started the design circle back after the release of the iphone 3G btw so it's not even a recent development. car manufacturers did it when they transitioned to modern looking cars with colors instead of creating new models in black like ford did when they started mass producing and it worked. the only reason cars and phones come in different shapes and sizes is to make people think that it's a trend they need to follow and it works, it always worked and in a globalized society where status matters it will keep working.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 23:59:00'] I still think they are a great company and the future may not be full on consumer products sold by them but other features like AI tech and virtual reality especially with what Meta are trying. Also, does anyone still queue for the latest iPhone’s? Remember that use to be big news.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 02:05:39'] 6 is the most important to me. They don't have AWS like buisness to shield them from a weak consumer. Apple store spending and even upgrading phones is frivilous spending at best. I don't have a pulse at how critical and leveraged the consumer is for q3.

POST_TEXT: b'Warning: long post with a lot of numbers and sources ahead, there is a tl;dr at the end.\n\nWhile everyone is focused on GME, BBBY, AMC, or whatever else is being pump and dumped on you guys on a weekly basis, I think one meme stock is flying under the radar: Apple. Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis. However, Apples valuation has gone past the point of insanity to the point of mass delusion.\n\nA lot of people treat Apple like its the same company it was in 2018. At the end of 2018, Apple was trading at:\n\n>P/E (Price to Earnings): 12.5  \n>  \n>P/S (Price to Sales): 2.9  \n>  \n>P/B (Price to Book): 6.1  \n>  \n>P/FCF (Price to Free Cash Flow): 11.9  \n>  \n>D/E (Debt to Equity): .8  \n>  \n>Cash + current marketable securities: $86.4B  \n>  \n>Long term debt: $93B  \n>  \n>TTM (Trailing 12 month) Revenue: $261.6B  \n>  \n>TTM Earnings: $59.4B\n\nCurrently, even after a 7-8% drop from the recent high, Apple is valued at:\n\n>P/E: 27 (**+116%** '

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 05:58:08'] If AAPL goes down, the entire market goes with it. It represents the largest holding of the indices. You might as well change the title to “You are here” and drop in the 2022/2008 overlaid chart with an arbitrary circle somewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 06:32:18'] It’s tough to bet against AAPL. Usually when they have revenue/earnings compression and a reduction of cash, it means they’re developing a product and trying to gain supply-chain dominance.Gabe Newell from Valve recently talked about AAPL in an interview and stated that the toughest part about getting their products to market is the competition with AAPL over the supply-chain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 17:44:48'] Agreed. I am thinking the stock will be at 120 after they report this quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 17:46:09'] Thank you for the write up. It’s great. Here is something I wrote previously: Some headlines recently mentioned that Apple has told suppliers to prepare for higher iPhone 14 pro sales volume. Great. It seems like a fantastic product with lots of updates that make it a great value. On top of that, they didn’t increase the prices on any of the models which shocked most people. And it should, because it is a certainty that the phone is now more expensive to produce and deliver into peoples hands than it was a year ago. Honestly, it’s a great move by Apple. The headline of “Fancy phone company increases prices because of inflation” would not have gone over well. They are going to eat the short term hit to profitability for long-term goodwill. It’s a genius, long-term oriented strategy. Plus they probably had no choice if they wanted to maintain revenue numbers.But what about profits? Apple is great at the supply chain, cost structure, and all of that stuff. But there is no way they can offset higher chip prices and material costs. So what did they do to help improve the profitability of the iPhone business segment? They slapped new packaging on the previous years lower end iPhone offerings and removed the worst selling low end model. Almost nothing has changed on the lower end models. According to Statista, the lower end model accounted for a majority of iPhone sales as recently as 2021. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/804398/us-iphone-sales-by-model/) There is probably better data out there, but the point is that the sales of the low end iPhone are really important. If they just slapped new packaging on the phone, why would anyone buy it? I don’t know. But I do know that it makes the higher end iPhone a much better deal. And this is holding true: “Apple expects 85% of early adopters to opt for a pro model” https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/09/iphone-14-sales/ and https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/19/apple-supplier-shifts-production-to-make-more-iphone-14-pro-modelsHow could 85% of early adopters opting for a pro model be a good thing if more than 50% of iPhone sales should come from the lower end iPhone? I’m no math magician, but something seems off there.   I’m sure people are talking about this, but I’ve personally stopped watching/listening to most news sources. All in all, Apple has a large and complex business, there are certainly other levers they are pulling to increase profitability. But it seems a near certainty to me that profitability is going to continue to decline while revenue may also decrease. I really don’t know, but I would certainly gamble on the stock going down via November 120 puts. Timing is everything though. Apple going down should bring down the stock market as well even if most stocks are doing well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 08:50:09'] They don't have to be so device dependent.Aside from ads, they have pricing power on recurring software and a good moat. Their "you never own a device" rental style program has potential, it takes the discount for having a more expensive phone plan off the carrier, which plenty people are already used to, and keeps it all in their hands.Rental, insurance, services and any other recurring pennies they can make.I have a small position because I have a genuine dislike of their products, but I'm not gonna bet against them. Apple people look at the devices I like as if they were some insane foreign gear-driven wrong-alphabet typewriter and always have.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-17 18:40:58'] This is just a solid value portfolio that's just focused on fundamentals. Burry doesn't like Meta because he believes in the metaverse, it's just a good bargain when you look at the numbers. Same with WBD. Same with STLA. Same with CI. Look at the financials and you'll understand the picks.Something that seems to be lacking recently.Only one I don't get is BKNG.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 14:05:43'] I'd adjust all the numbers to account for the piles of cash you'd also be buying, kind of cash-back rebate on your $2.3T purchase. Too lazy to look at balance sheet to subtract assets from liabilities.. but I'm pretty sure it's positive. Plus, isn't it possible they borrowed a fuck ton of money at low rates and can now just themselves buy treasury bills to make money off of the borrowed money?On the scale of things, won't matter much to your argument. The real wiggle room is in how far into the future you want to value their growth and prospects.They have some incredible products and even more incredibly stupid users. I mean.. you can't even add a fucking memory card to their phones, ipads, etc... instead you get reamed to pay more. But.. wow.. there's a "virtual island" or whatever. And people are all happy about the fact they offer the higher memory versions, get excited about new colors and increasingly worthless features, etc, etc. Hard to put a number on holding a massively loyal fanbase that throws money at you happily.But, I agree, I think they're going to take a tumble. Not because investors want to park their money elsewhere (there will always be an appetite for risk, and AAPL represents the best of value AND growth combined).. but because I think consumers will slow their discretionary spending a lot, and that's what the market is going to care about.I have March $110P.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 12:58:42'] Thoughtful post, thank you.One question, why do you think that it may not “fit (apple’s) fiduciary duty’s to continue to buy back shares given yields currently”??As in, if I think I follow you, you’re saying:Apple has $5b in cash it intends to deploy by buying back shares (random number); it would be contrary to the BODs fiduciary duty to approve a stock buyback when it could instead deploy that cash into 5 or 10 year bonds?Whilst I don’t agree with that notion, that it would violate their fiduciary duty, perhaps they think that it makes sense to do so, both because (1) they’re not paying any dividend on the shares they buy back, so that’s ~.65% of $5b in shares they’re not paying dividends on, which by my childish math is around $32m, saved, and (2) they think apple will be worth at least 4%+ more in 5 years or whatever length of bond we’re talking about, which isn’t per se crazy to speculate that would be the case.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:15:25'] I have been deep in the VR scene since its inception with the Virtual Boy for the Nintendo. This headset is absolutely insane if the specs that are being written in the news articles are correct. It has a 4K screen per Eye at least. It is Micro-OLED which is the pinnacle of display technology especially important in VR headsets. It reaches up to 5000 nits and has 4000 Pixels per Inch (PPI). These specs are absolutely groundbreaking to say the least. This headset is at least 5 years ahead of its competition. The downside is, that it also costs 8x more than the competion. 3500$.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:43:39'] Y'all joke, but if anyone can make Google glasses with AR/VR and AI be cool enough to wear, it's Apple.The Humane Ted Talk is when I went all in on Apple. Ironically, not all in on Humane. Chaudri gave a great demo, and it convinced me that Apple will be the ones to do it. Like all things Apple, they won't be the first or have the most features, and it will be overpriced, but they'll be the ones who make the thing real people actually adopt.They'll steal it all from Humane or something, sure, but it will be the Apple version that wins.That's my bet anyway. Remind me in 5 years. We'll see if I went wrong by buying Apple stock right before the next biggest revolution in personal computing.I don't think many people have said that, but there's always a first. Wow, I really messed up buying apple stock right before GUIs took over. Wow, I really messed up buying Apple stock before laptops outpaced desktops. Wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before personal mp3 players took off. Wow, I really messed up buyiny Apple stock right before smart phones took off. LolNow I'm supposed to think some day I'll say "wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before AI/VR/AR converged"That's a calculated risk I'm willing to take.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:02:10'] Lmao people who bash VR (note not AR) as a bad investment are so short sighted. As someone using it everyday it’s like reading comments about the internet in 1992 where the news segments are laughing at notion the infant WWW would result in anything significant. If you know someone with a meta quest go ask to play thrill of the fight (a $10 game) and experience getting your fucking ass kicked in a single 3 round fight in less than 10 minutes. You will be dripping with sweat throwing haymakers in an immersive simulated boxing match, and the best part is it’s insanely FUN. I’ve lost 20 pounds literally because of a video game lmao, with 0 changes to my diet. Every person I have shown my VR headset two are amazed by it. Once the triple AAA companies start making games it will the future vr will play a major role in video games. It’s is the ultimate immersive  experience for games. And video games are only a fraction of the potential revenue streams. In the next 10 years the NFL and NBA will be selling monthly subscription options to watch games in VR from a court side seats perspective. The nfl I promise you, will put cameras on qb helmets to give you in the moment feel of a game from the qbs perspective. VR has so many potential options for revenue, sports and video games are just the obvious start.TLDR you are being a dumb dumb if you think VR is a fad. It’s new, it’s not perfect, but holy shit go use one and you will understand. It’s like the first time you used an iPhone and got that “yeah… this is the future” feeling. I promise you, two of the 7 biggest companies in the world are not investing billions in the space without the due diligence, and more importantly foresight, to see where VR is 5 to 10 years from now. It has the potential to be their flagship product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:59:25'] I have not read all the comments, but I had a good laugh when they showed the Apple Silicone MacPro. „Look. You get the same M2 everyone gets. Remember the thousands of dollars you spent on that Intel rig? It’s completely obsolete, but this now.“Apple Chips are impressive but I have not and probably never will buy a mac that is obsolete in two years because Apple iterates their silicon to artificially fast track product cycles. Nope. I love myself an iPhone but I will not spend money on iPads and macs that in theory have the same performance, but are limited due to cooling, form factors etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:40:43'] What APPLE just did is GENIUS. They basicaly got free advertising by saying that their VR would cost 3500 and people are gonna talk about it a lot plus they are inflating their price to make the brand more “luxurious” and “prestigious” just by pumping the VR price to a very high price point. They did it well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:45:51'] While I was listening to Tim Apple and his fellows, I was wondering how much it will cost. I thought 5k. Maybe I am not even wrong, as they said starts at 3,5k. With this price point it will be niche product

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:46:42'] I got real excited until i saw the actual number
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:47:09'] Intel is down 4%
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:47:52'] IMO Apple did the opposite of pulling a Meta.  They delivered on the right direction for the product category and didn't bet the whole company on it.  Meta is sort of flailing around with their vision for the future.  Apple seemingly nailed a starting point that looks impressive as hell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:52:18'] I think people underestimate augmented reality. It's coming whether you like it or not. It's the next computer. The next phone. The same friction was present during the launch of iPhone.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 20:10:25'] I'm selling meta puts at open. My guess is it's gonna pump pre market, unfortunately.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 21:57:26'] I don’t think meta pumps before market opens. I think it goes lower into 90s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 23:21:16'] Meta was a more sure shot to short this ER imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 20:58:26'] Do it, I hit Microsoft and almost doubled down on META but pussied out. Would have been up 40k on the week. I’m buying 10 atm weekly appl puts at close tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 22:13:43'] I wouldn’t gamble on Apple, the new iPhone has only been out for a month, the economic crisis hasn’t caught up with their sales yet.Next quarter is going to be brutal though.Positions: none, gambled it all
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 22:38:23'] All tech can't tank. I mean will the market make it that easy? Pre-Earnings Put free for all week like this? I'd go XOM calls for premarket earnings call Friday. Crude Oil just had a nice bump. If crude oil can stay elevated through Friday morning that could enhance an inevitable positive XOM earnings. Or the market just reversed psychology'd me and all big Tech tanks this week including Apple 🙁

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-15 10:59:12'] IRNT was never an investment or a so called “short squeeze” Was always a trade and gamma opportunity because all the high volume in options.  People make money both ways. Thats why you see the switch in sentiment both ways. Up, bulls pumping. Down, 🌈 🐻s trying to get under your skin.Just my 2 cents

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-15 10:43:00'] For all you pussy paper handers let me tell you something. IRNT is far from over. This rocket will not land today. We have a shit load of calls ITM right now expiring Friday and a short interest that only grows with time. They are fumbling and shitting themselves trying to trigger stop losses because they know they're fucked.Buy the dip, hold, and ride the rocket because these fucks are going to fund our lambos for being retards. I don't even remember what the sell button looks like anymore and neither should you. KEEP HOLDING.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-15 12:46:16'] It just feels too obvious at this point. The price action implies the DD is spot on. I just wonder if we're overestimating how much of the ITM is actually exercised. Regardless, I really think some of the big boys believe in the DD and it shows.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-15 18:43:00'] To everyone wondering why the latest DD was deleted, the only thing deleted was today’s update. I’d assume he may have had an error that needed more review or he may even be worried about a DFV type backlash. DFV had a lot to answer to after gme blew up. If I was the OP on IRNT DD I’d be making sure my figures are 100% and if I have any hesitation I’d be taking it down to take the time to insure it’s correct.

POST_TEXT: b'$V and $MA both are global payment processing companies that operate networks of electronic payment systems and issue credit and debit cards. $V is the larger of the two companies and has a larger global presence. They both generate revenue by charging fees to merchants and financial institutions for the use of their payment processing network.

Even though $AAPL is a large company with a large customer base, it would need to make a significant investment in order to create its own credit card and compete with $V and $MA. Additionally, $V has strong financials, with revenue and net income growth in the last year, and strong ROE and ROIC.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:01:52'] Doesn't AAPL pay still utilize V/MC's payment network? Even contactless pay is tied to a credit card that's run on V/MC/D/AMEX no? How exactly would this unseat them?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 16:26:22'] Look, I’m not trying to be rude here…..but you are posting “due diligence” and “investment ideas” when it is clear you really have no clue what you are talking about. You say you hold Visa, but you CLEARLY have no idea how their business works or how they make money……how do it know this??Visa and Mastercard do not ISSUE credit or debit cards. That’s not their business model. They simply operate the payment networks. A company like American Express both issues cards AND process payments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 10:59:40'] OP read thishttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-apple-pay-works-under-the-hood-8c3978238324/amp/
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 05:47:22'] >No, you should not sell $V.**What do you think about the long-term prospects of $AAPL?**VisualMod: I believe that $AAPL is a strong company with a bright future. They have innovative products and services that are in high demand by consumers. They also have a large customer base and continue to grow their market share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 06:08:31'] Reality. AAPL has barely double digit market penetration in most of the world. It is no threat to Visa or MA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:40:04'] I believe I read V and MC see AAPL as a bit of threat, however, Visa also does contactless payments, and they collect fees rather than extend credit. They provide the card system for financial institutions to extend credit and then collect fees from it. Apple is probably trying to get in on those fees, rather than offering their own credit card. If they offered their own credit card, it'd probably be backed up by some bank. So no, AAPL offering a credit card wont bankrupt them
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 15:08:44'] There are thousands of banks that provide the same services and coexisted for a very longtime.  I think V anD MA will be fine

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 03:48:23'] In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. The reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. However, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. The entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. Almost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. So there are two big points to make here. 1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. 2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. Nvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. Tesla at 64Microsoft at 36Apple at 30Google at 28 So you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't. We are in the fomo greed cycle at the very end before a big hit. Stay cash and get ready to play the ups and downs for the next year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 21:55:30'] Apple is going to have legal issues soon with its 30% app fee. Musk has already tweeted it seems too much. Then EU just forced Apple to change its charging cable to USB-C mandatory. This is going to end up costing Apple some $. Apple sales are down 11% in China. While they may make up the loss revenue in streaming services they are gonna take a hit on product services and show a slow in growth on phones tablets laptops. I’ll probably end up playing it safe and just have a couple of puts but it wouldn’t surprise me if they miss on earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 09:38:45'] I do think Apple just didn’t tank in order to prepare for earnings they were still in the green overall for the year which isn’t common in the market right now. I believe that it’s they kinda had some money set aside for the drop. Also china hasn’t been consuming due to its geopolitical issues. Personally I haven’t bought a new iPhone since 2019 since SE,XR and even 11s and 12s can be bought for less than 300 bucks

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 08:30:55'] >I think that people are definitely paying too much for AAPL right now. The company is facing many headwinds, and their revenue growth has been slowing down significantly. I believe that the current price does not reflect the risks involved with investing in AAPL right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 10:08:46'] I’m poor but I followed suit and bought a put at 140. Normally everyone at my job gets a new iPhone shortly after their release. No one purchased one this release.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 08:44:11'] there was a DD a few months ago that said even if they hit the quarters goals best case scenario the numbers will still result in a YOY decline in revenue. I can’t find it anymore if anyone can find it I’d appreciate it

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 07:32:02'] I wish AAPL didn't make up 50% of my portfolio, so that I could justify buying more
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 07:07:51'] >It's no surprise that the cheaper iPhone 14 is outselling the more expensive iPhone 14 Plus. Apple has been increasingly focused on selling pricier models in recent years, and it looks like that strategy is paying off yet again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 08:50:53'] Yes because Cramer said "only 1 thing to do with AAPL, buy and hold forever". The F$CKED for sure now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 11:16:23'] It still feels a little overvalued for me, at least with what we know so far. It can’t just be a new watch, iPad, etc. year over year. They need to unveil something big because people just don’t feel an urgent need to upgrade any more. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see some missed projections and corrections until then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 07:48:43'] Apple knows supply chain well, and I trust them slowing production more than if they had continued to pump production just because. The Plus models have always had lower demand than the standard versions. I see this as them testing demand and adjusting production accordingly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 11:11:31'] Apple will probably fall to low 130s possibly 120s  not by end of week but eventually and then hopefully that will be the bottom
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 08:16:54'] Yea, the base models are selling like shit. Pro versions are allegedly doing better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 09:24:34'] If the lower-than-expected demand for the Plus is truly related to a higher-than-expected demand for the Max or the Pro models in general, seems like AAPL shouldn’t have much to worry about long-term
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 10:04:22'] What about earnings tho what direction do we think and how hard
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:49:11'] Real world performance doesn’t matter. The market doesn’t care if they sell 20% more or less from last year. The only thing that matters is the pump and dumps fueled by the fed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 07:23:12'] I dont get it, i tested some of your bull spreads on optionsStrat and by what im looking at, if you miss one of those trades by as little as 3% you lose like 3x as much as your max profit. I mean it feels like you are treading on a very fine line between a good % return and total loss.  With calls if the underlaying is down 3% from breakeven and you are approaching expiry date you can sell for like a 30% loss. But with spreads you lose it all. Am i missing something or am i wrong?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-31 17:53:16'] We're talking about the guy who predicted the dot com crash, housing market crash, and the current recession we're in. Main issue is his predictions are early, but accurate, and when he predicts something's going to happen, there's a higher probability it will. With Apple, the issue comes at how more people are starting to distrust the company through its practices while recognizing the overpriced aspect, to where more people are starting to buy apple products less often then they used to. Add in the chip shortages that have been going on and how apple hasn't really been in the forefront of the tech industry since Steve Jobs passing, and quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if the company does crash in the coming 1-3 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 06:20:50'] Whatever the market does today, people will all act like it was a completely obvious result.  Up half a percent?  Of course, the market is optimistic about the recession ending in a few months and thinks there's a rate cut pause coming, for some reason.  Earnings beat (low) expectations and employment numbers are strong.Market tanks 2%?  Of course, CPI wednesday, lots of instability, banks still in great danger with a lot of underwater assets and inflation woes still strong and there's risk of more rate hikes, especially since employment numbers are strong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 05:54:50'] My buddy called me about 1.5 years ago because he got caught on a dating app by his gf. Background:  My buddy matched with a nurse on Hinge and the nurse knew my buddys gf. The nurse told the gf and then my buddy panicked.My buddy asks me to take the fall and tell his gf that I created the hinge profile and was playing a prank on him.  The gf is so fucking stupid that she actually believed it. I had to talk to the gf on the phone and sell this.Fast forward to about a year ago: I’m at a mutual friends wedding in Tulum and my buddy brings his gf (I bring mine).  My buddy’s gf goes apeshit on me and refused to talk to my gf when introductions were being made.Fast forward to 6 months: my buddy and his gf get engaged.  His bachelor party is in a couple months and I’m not invited.Should I nuke the entire friend circle if they allow this to happen?

POST_TEXT: b'everyone knows AAPL is the only thing keeping the market afloat. I come back here from the pub on a jovial wednesday night in Australia, check the market before going to bed, SPY is holding steady above support but AAPL has flushed right through.  \n\n\nWas there some big new I missed? i searched google but couldn\'t find anything. Is this simply the capitulation event we\'ve all be anticipating and waiting for.   \n\n\nanother thing i\'m wondering is how the SPY is holding up despite this AAPL flush.   \n\n\nLiterally what happened, regards. Did one of you get drunk, break into the NAZDAQ last night and accidentally put and empty button on the "short aapl" button? I\'m treading for word count so this post doesn\'t get auto-deleting, but i think this could potentially move the market in a big way today.'

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 06:09:21'] Apple bag holder here, incoming recession threat, strong dollar, stale iPhone upgrades becoming even more stale as years go on. Even on watch where you would think there would be nice upgrades they have moved to ultra so 8 is like same same, but different, but still the same. Pretty much every country outside of the US saw a 20% price hike with the dollar.They need some company to release a breakthrough product so they can buy it and or make a better version which is what they do.I still buy more regularly enoughEdit: I saw this stale patch coming so I sold a significant chunk at 175 in July. But as I said above, I'll be buying more as we go! ❤️🍎
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:32:20'] Because they know things are going to get much worse before they get any better
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:45:35'] Simple. If AAPL is the only thing keeping ze market afloat n it's dropped 3% in premarket it means the market's gonna crash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:46:21'] Shares of Apple moved lower in premarket trading after the company scrapped plans to increase iPhone production amid softer-than-expected demand, Bloomberg reported. The company told suppliers that it will aim to produce 90 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. The tech giant planned to make up to 6 million more handsets, though the 90 million level is in line with the company's original forecast from the summer. Apple stock has fallen 15% this year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:58:25'] Production plans decreased, and Apple News hacked for a racist headline to be sent to people's phones.Overall not terrible news, but the market is sensitive right now. How Apple recovers or doesn't today will tell where the market is going.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 06:10:15'] I saw a news article talking about the upcoming earnings reports of future companies could be disappointing due to the rise in interest rate, a firm with big bucks could be selling apple at large rates at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:50:19'] Maybe using the decreased production news to drive down stock price for stock buy back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 06:01:09'] It will go back up at open. Unless appl loose revenue by billions stock wont tank. This is just nature of trading in future market. The future tanking a lot then coming back up at open. Its probably doing it since the big slump couple of weeks back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:17:03'] China lockdowns are my biggest concern for AAPL. They already came out this week and said iPhone sales for the year will be at the low end of expectations and last quarter said to expect 6 to 8 billion less in revenue due to supply shortages stemming from China so a lot of this is priced in, but because there’s no clear visibility to Foxconn and it’s ability to produce at the moment due to zero covid, if we are going to see a gap down on Apple or it hitting $125 or so would be after this quarters earnings. Anything under $130 I’ll be loading the bag.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:58:40'] I’ve been bag-holding AAPL for over 10 years. There have been quarters with disappointing iPhone sales before (the iPhone 6s year, for example), but sooner or later Apple always rebounds because it tends to be quick at identifying issues and often turns them into strengths. The growth of iPhone sales has decreased for a while now, everyone knows smartphones are a mature product now and people tend to use them longer. That’s why Apple created the $1000 phone category in the first place. They’ve also diversified a lot, with services still growing strong, and the Mac being more appealing than ever due to the switch to Apple silicon. Apple also has fantastic production efficiency, does a lot in-house, has special privileges with its manufacturers (for example, Foxconn making sure that Apple products are assembled on time even when everything else is on hold), and is actively working on reducing its reliance on China for manufacturing. The fact that they plan a huge stock buyback is also a good sign of its health, in my opinion.Yes, a couple of bad quarters could be bad for the company. And yes, it’s still very reliant on iPhone sales. Generally, I expect their growth to slow in the future, possibly turning into a value stock over the next 5–10 years. But I don’t think Apple has any more risks than Google, and the argument “it’s not the same price it was in 2019” doesn’t really convince me.If you want to play some short-term bets against Apple be my guest, but I’m sleeping very well with my shares (admittedly, I’ve sold a lot this year and only have 700 left).

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 20:04:54'] Apple can prob keep the music going for awhile.  What most people gloss over is that to maintain their sales. They’ve had to rely increasingly on much more frequent releases of increasing price. And a huge chunk of their revenue is the iPhone.    If people ever blink the company is in trouble That being said.    If you like the stock. Get it.  If it’s slightly down. It’s a slight discount.  I hate apple …but wish I had bought more when it was low $100.  A year or so ago

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 05:20:45'] No not really. The consumer will not be 100% dead, if they are then it doesn't matter what you own its going down. Apple pays a dividend, buys back stock, has a lot of cash, can still map their branding on to any product and succeed. If the consumer is not turned into a child flesh eating zombie then Apple will be considered a value stock by many and be one of the first to recover after a crash. People will need to or want to buy their products before so many other consumption needs or desires besides underwear and food. Even stained underwear with holes wont stop some people from deploying into or upgrading their apple ecosystem.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 15:11:39'] They used to have $200 billion in cash. Now they have $50 billion. Where did the rest go?They have production and logistics problems in China. So things are getting delayed including Macs and iPhones.China's Zero-COVID policy has caused massive economic destruction in the country and for consumers. They will be pulling back on buying Apple products until they can repair their balance sheets and have incomes again.Most of the rest of the world will probably go into recession, just as part of the economic cycle and central banks trying to kill inflation.Apple said that they expect to take a $4 billion to $8 billion hit to their bottom line for Q2. That's a lot of money, even for Apple.And I love the company and their products. They just have a rough patch to get through of about 9 months. Hoping to pick them up again at $70.

POST_TEXT: b'A far cry from the usual posts of 0DTE and. $BBBY and other extremely high risk options. The more I read about apple the more the company seems like it is effortlessly ahead of its competitors. Their ability to poach other markets is unique. Surveys suggest the apple car is even more popular than Teslas. Simultaneously have exceeded a 50% share of the mobile phone market. Their watchful waiting in the electric car market, in my opinion, is going to pay off massively. I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it wont return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short. I still gamble on meme stocks however I have learnt 10-20% is ok, but not 100% and I certainly think a lot of money can be saved in the process.\n\nDisclaimer; this is my opinion and p'

As a cpu enthusiastic, their M1 chips are a new paradigm shift in design. They aren't even a monopoly quite yet, compared to windows or google. Just a strong brand.I might gamble on some calls 162.5 and up. It was 160 a week ago, and the announcement this week might finally add in satellite internet to cell phones, which would be a huge boost to their primary product - the iPhone. If they add to all their computers...

So two straight quarters with negative y/y growth.It has a PE of 30 but it’s not a growth stock - I think the only thing the market sees in it is possible huge growth from India and huge cash flow which has gone into share buy backs.For these reason I am also short APPL - currently short 60 shares at $172 and adding more shorts as it continues up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:25:02'] Yeah right, look at that Feb and April RSI, keep getting smaller and smaller pullbacks. With the atmosphere we're in as of the past 2 days, I'd expect roughly a $3.50 retracement once we hit an RSI of 95ish.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:40:16'] WRONG! The times that chart show in the period of high inflation and interest rates. Now they both are decreasing (FED will eventually decrease the rates). So if you make comment on this chart, you cannot ignore these. I think Apple share will increase furthermore because inflation is cooling as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 11:54:17'] here is the thing... maybe it was the case, but past performance doesn't necessarily indicate future trend.apple has been making improvement in streaming shows now, which could lead to future upside, potentially. also if they announce an auto purchase... all bets are off, but yes, there is some debate based on prior seen action what the big maker makers will do.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 06:12:46'] Friday had massive buying come in at last hour and it didn't seem like it was just shorts covering.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 19:45:23'] The main index’s weekly chart is a head and shoulders reversal pattern. https://i.postimg.cc/HkfWb6Xv/5-B9-C58-AC-FC7-F-4-DFD-ADC1-AC1-D4696-EC30.jpgRight shoulder is imperfect but it’s clear as day to me.Usually, when the bottom VTL of a head and shoulder gets broken, it will head straight down. This is why I think if there is a rally, it won’t make it to the top VTL on your chart. It might make it half way there, and this will look like a wick on the weekly chart.Head and shoulders can be measured to predict the long term move for swing trading. Duplicate the existing parallel channel, take the duplicated parallel channel’s top VTL and put it on top of the existing parallel channel’s bottom VTL. Whatever the duplicated parallel channel’s bottom VTL is, is the next price target. But that’s not the true bottom, it’s just a measured move. That would be under 10k for Nasdaq, and around 360 for SPY.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 08:59:46'] Analysts in the Swiss Central Bank go through years of education and on-job experiences only to arrive at the same conclusion as the fellow WSB degenerate. I see that as a win for us.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:59:44'] Quoted from the SNB's investment policy guidelines:> As regards its equity investments, the SNB pursues an investment approach that is as market-neutral and passive as possible by replicating individual stock markets in their entirety and thereby diversifying its investments as broadly as possible. In principle, the SNB does not engage in stock picking, nor does it overweight or underweight particular sectors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 13:51:29'] The reason they buy that stuff is to lower the value of the swiss france. It's a problem for the swiss industry that people flee to the CHF whenever there is a crisis. So basically they buy the worst shit they kind find. The worse the asset is, the better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:29:54'] i am expecting aapl to go under 100 over the summer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:10:42'] AAPL is currently trading at roughly 10x cash on hand, which is a massive discount. Between that and their massive share repurchase plans it's gonna go brrr in the near future.  currently short 165 September puts, and short 170 july 15 calls. It's the biggest position in my portfolio at about 100k.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-19 10:23:40'] Yea, no shit…
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:06:41'] As of their most recent quarter, they authorized an additional 90 billion to share repurchasing and currently have about 107b to repurchase shares. If aapl stock falls lower, they will be able to buy more shares. At the current pace, they have been repurchasing with around 20 billion per quarter. This should bring down outstanding shares significantly and increase eps over time. Keep in mind that there are other factors at hand like stock based compensation, but aapl stock buybacks severely outpace any dilution they have.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:33:31'] I don’t think any substantial amount of investors or even traders look at that tiny micropenis of a gap from 2 years ago as to have any meaning whatsoever; also your lines on it are completely wrong.As for AAPL:  I believe $100 might be the price the market will say enough’s enough and start scooping it up en mass, aka the bottom.  It’s such a nice round number psychologically, and a 30% contraction in its bloated P/E that makes sense from this level, in this market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:44:50'] AAPL will see $80 before it sees $170 again
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:10:58'] Don’t know. AAPL used to be an amazing hardware company and now is a services + hardware company. I’m not sure they are going to be able to invent something like the iPod or the iPhone again to be able to come out of the recession thriving. If there isn’t a recession, you might be right. If there is one they may not come out winning.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 15:31:25'] { it’s pretty dumb, and pretty common, to hold a losing position in any time frame account… ok 401k aside I get that..  but once spy went red on the year (2nd day of the year?), or took out January lows, or took out 1st quarter lows, or took out last year lows… maybe you should make adjustments…buy put protection, sell calls, do something! }I mean I agree with the title of your post, but it’s kind of like so what?  Is there really any question if aapl is a good buy long term? I’d be interested to hear a case as to why not. Something more than just the fact there’s a gap down there, idk..The real question with any ticker in the market has always been when to buy and when to sell.So are you holding puts or planning to buy puts or short selling or waiting on more information or what? Do you have a position? otherwise this kind of post just appeals to bias of both sides…  diluting the power of this sub and 12million autists with more indecisive “maybe” stuff .  It doesn’t really say much of anything other than telling investors hold your long position.  Why would you hold if you think there’s a gap good ways down that’s gonna get filled ?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-18 22:12:34'] I like your charting man, but I’d say that what you found is a momentum gap, which is less likely to get filled. Gaps that fill are usually top and bottom reversal gaps, like island gaps. Momentum gaps are pretty common and most of the time don’t fill. That being said there does seem to be some resistance at that level, which could turn into a support so we could see the price get there
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-19 00:13:26'] The gap fill thing is really the stupidest of all set ups.  It’s like people don’t realize there is pre market and post market trading.  There were plenty of prints inside that gap.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-19 09:38:12'] Look at an AAPL all time, if it isn’t obvious that this isn’t a bubble then this sorta thing may not be for you. Even with the current drop, the return to shareholders (not even accounting for dividends) is 219,000%. This gal has a long way to go down, and I’m not saying it has to happen all at once.

Well apparently chinese people are dying to buy iphones. They are literally killing each other to get an iphone. \n\nBut wait. Isnt the asian market known to always want the best product configuration available for the cheapest price? I.e their iphones have dual sim slot, their androids have the fastest processors. While in the west people are happy with what they get. \n\nLets look at apple today and their future line up. Their core business is still the iphone, their next line up iphone 14 will have the old. A15 chip thats already in the iPhone 13. \nTheir new macbook air base model 256gb has a 30-40% slower ssd than the last generation but with a rougly 30% price spike.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:22:48'] I think the "green" from this was on Friday. Tea leaves on a deal already shown. Like others said, I'm expecting a bit of a pull back this next week. In fact, I think going into June fomc , markets might be a bit uneasy about another hike , given PCE came in hot last week. All that said, I could be completely wrong and we keep chugging along like some regarded bulls

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 05:06:38'] Absolutely trade on this, no way it goes sideways. There is zero chance enough of the Republicans and Democrats that hate this deal tank it. It's impossible that McCarthy loses his job over it. It will definitely get through both the house and Senate without amendments and breeze straight through. This is basically free money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:52:20'] Just got thru telling my brother the same. Looking for a lot of green on tue! With the tech rally already pushing the nasdaq and s&p we've crossed key resistance in the s&p around 4155. Add in the relief of a debt ceiling deal and I think we have what it takes to begin a bull market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:55:10'] "While an end to uncertainty would be welcome, the relief that may come from a deal may be a short-lived sugar high for investors.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:28:07'] Most likely will be green just because we are in the midst of a bull run, but this has little impact. This has already been priced into the market, hence the rally the past few weeks while media tries to sell you this story of US defaulting. As a trader of over 10yrs, I have seen this hysteria with  the debt ceiling multiple times and we always come to a resolution and avoid default. The real money knows that as well and never doubted it, unlike the media would lead you to believe.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 08:22:18'] It has not been reached, it’s a tentative agreement, you brainless regard. They still have to vote on it 🥴
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 08:37:45'] One would think so but how many times has good news been bad news for wallstreet? Tha market is so manipulated and controlled even when we have record inflows in the market we mysteriously hang in a strong bear market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:28:27'] This is when the bloody show truly begins. This is the biggest bull trap in history. Everyone going to pile in only to get rugged so hard as the bond yields spike and treasuries get dumped. Maybe not on Tuesday but soon. Maybe it’ll take papa powell coming out as a hawk but it’s going to happen in the near future

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 13:09:11'] I would argue this is still a buy the rumor since the deal isn’t final. When it’s final then sell. Last week’s FOMO will still be pumping IMO, not financial advice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:28:33'] This is still a rumor, it will be news when final.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 15:02:54'] I see a lot of stupid. Puts for sure
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 15:07:13'] Remember, CPI inflation is a year-over-year number. We've been comparing inflation improvements over last year's numbers when inflation was climbing each month, making it easier to beat. It peaked in June '22. After June this year we'll begin comparing inflation to a number that started dropping a year ago meaning it will be a harder comparison. I think CPI will become harder to beat after June numbers and will start going up again. The easy inflation has been tackled. The hard sticky inflation of wages and employment will be harder to improve upon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 17:53:19'] Still has to be passed by both the House and Senate, regard. And there's a lot of pissed off Repubs and Dems about this "deal" that essentially accomplishes nothing for anyone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 06:58:32'] The data speaks for itself - mega-cap tech stocks have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin so far this year.

Remember that aapl has a massive holding in these etfs and can move it up big time. We're starting to see headlines talking about less covid restrictions over in china, so we'll see how things play out. You do not want to be shorting if you see this formation break to the upside.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 03:36:42'] Something to keep in mind is that this is only net gain and not net realized gain. Also, you're going to have lower reported losses because most people wouldn't want to willingly declare their losses.Tldr: The post is pointless but decent entertainment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:17:13'] Thanks for sharing, agree with some points but definitely disagree with your idea of watching Bloomberg and CNBC all day. They are rarely on the side of retails best interest and are puppets to the controlling powers to play a fear game on retail investors and traders to get in and out of their positions at the worst of times. I'm sure you reflect back and wish you took the advice I'm about to give everyone on here.Invest, put your money in a basket of stocks/etf's all in and never look back, only down the road after 10 plus years. People who truly invest in stocks get rewarded.Every seasoned investor/trader can tell you a story how they had a plethora of stocks at very low prices but decided to sell after holding for small gains either because of fear or felt like they needed to cash in some meesley gains. How many of you at one time have owned shares of Tesla, apple, Kla, ASML, enphase, applied materials, Facebook, google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, amd, nvda at infintile stages in their stock price lives and say to yourself "only if I would have held for 10 years"People who invest in America long term get rewarded, more times then not That is the best advice you will ever get .Ok now the funny people can start now with typical wsb sayings....let's here it, the big money controllers are feasting on you...yes just like the casino.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:05:49'] I meant to say I like the age of the redditors in this sub. And, the mix. So using flair and posting / commenting with [Nu, Bu, Be] once per day, unless your sentiment changes. I’m sure A.I. is reading every post and comment and doing this already, but the average WSB participant doesn’t have access to WSB Sentiment. What if WSB could measure WSB sentiment in real-time? If it were legal, it could take WSB to new levels perhaps. Periodically, the inverse-inversers (and liars) will also tell a tale. The data could be useful. Especially if the participants only entered flair after they made a trade. WSB could become a house.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 08:45:02'] I just wrote a detailed analysis on the behavior of some of you regards of what you consider a "short squeeze" of another famous symbol this week that I did the research on.Reality is, what you regards think is a short squeeze, is likely just a buying rally. Yes shorters will have to close their positions when the stock rallies 50-100-200% but then it's only up because some regard bought it at that high premium. When the shorts are closed, a continued rally only means a bag holder passing the bag.GL yall squeezing these evil wallstreets. In reality yall just squeezing each other :)The post got banned because it's literally my first post and I have offended some admin's lack of reading skills.&#x200B;EDIT: Short interest gets reported biweekly. Whatever it is the short interest on your favorite symbol today, [will be published on June 29th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest), 20 days from now. Read the rules, regards.

POST_TEXT: b" I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.\n\nI am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.\n\n# When will this tight range end?\n\nWay back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 12:49:39'] u/mrnotadvice, I understand that VIX is an indicator of 30-day option premiums. The trend you did not discuss in your post is that the last year of "no correlation" is the year of 0DTEs getting increasingly popular. My take - irrespective of the other factors, peeps are getting less interested in 30-day options and more interested in 0TDE, 1DTE, etc. This naturally drives the 30-day premiums down - less demand for them. Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 00:15:43'] So, if I would post some schizo-ramblings about xyz BEING MANIPULATED by THE MAN, and that the current crisis and crashes of the last year are all ARTIFICIAL and that it takes only one of THESE 5 TRIGGERS or these 10 secret triggers for the market to BOOOM. Would this convince you to flip-flop and buy calls instead?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 22:22:54'] How do you think the US is able to manipulate the oil market other than Biden dumping shit loads of barrels on the market via the SPR (which is about to end). I’ve been wondering how the oil market has had so much weakness when in reality Biden and co. Is about to run out of oil to dump on the market while at the same time OPEC might cut more and we are in summer season which results in massive draws which were only being offset last year by his SPR draws. It’s been upsetting as on oil and gas investor to watch this fucking absolute ass clown in office fuck this up so bad. The rubber band affect is going to play out soon. Rig count is already dropping substantially again like in 2020. This will further decrease supply. The oil companies and investors like me are relatively pissed about how they haven’t let the natural functions of the market play out how they should have all for an election coming up. I think the end result will be an oil shock worse than 2022. The only cure for high prices is higher prices…

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 03:19:04'] i don't buy some of your major points:\- volatility is computed from stock movements, so in order to manipulate you need to manipulate significant parts of the markets. this would require big amounts of capital and also risk. who would do such a foolish move ?\- same with oil. its a huge market, even us is limited in manipulation power. There can be some effort like releasing strat reserve and political pressure, but that's limited in effect. Oil is going down as the ongoing economical global weakness / recession reduces demand

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 08:30:12'] 1. Ironically, it’s Russian oil that is preventing opec from controlling the oil market. Russia needs cash and can’t cut production. I don’t see this changing unless Russia gives up in Ukraine, but even then Russia’s economy will take time to recover.2. I absolutely don’t see the case for Jpow cutting rates to address the debt ceiling fallout. JPow was bullied into not raising rates in 2018 and it is clear that was a massive mistake. I don’t think he will make the mistake of using the Fed to fix political economic crisis again. He even said in the FOMC meeting that the debt ceiling is not the responsibility of the Fed. In this case, I believe him. He’s not going to risk his image/legacy to fix the fallout of a MAGA political stunt. The capitulation will have to be political. 3. A ban on short selling just isn’t going to happen unless a 2008 level event occurs. It won’t be a trigger but a reaction to an already occurring crisis. I don’t think a temporary sell off due to the debt ceiling stunt will qualify. To get political capitulation on the debt ceiling, politicians have to let the stock market suffer in the short term so they can blame the other party for ‘holding our economy hostage’4. Appl may win as the temporary flight to safety play, especially if treasuries are seen as risky given the debt ceiling nonsense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:00:10'] 0dte's are what is bringing vix straight down after peaks which also increases its volatility. Nowadays options are controlling the stock prices, not revenues, p/e or margins.I have seen enough economies degrade to more than obvious oligarchies, so I am sceptical about the great CRASH. There will be downturns, but in slow boiling frog style - until the S&P goes back where it belongs until inflation shoots it up to other magnitudes. What I agree on is that things are worsening, so expect heavier downturns once a week, not once a month like in recent times.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:01:29'] Since you mentioned VIX was being suppressed early on, I checked, it is doing the same that it always has, the inverse of SPX.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:15:33'] Unpopular opinion but I am bullish on tech stocks. All this news gives no edge. Ever heard of the kansas city shuffle? Its a giant con job where u think youve figured out the con but its actually a double con and what you think is the con is actually the decoy and what ends up happening is the opposite. Think about this: inflating dollar is bearish for the dollar in the long run, which in turn is bearish for bonds. Blue chip stocks especially tech have an inverse correlation so they are probably bullish. Ive had this thesis since late last year and the markets reacted as I was suspecting. Remember this whole thing is a zero-sum game. If the news outlets (who are in bed with the banks and fed and treasury and everyone thats corrupt) are selling bearish news - that's like a sports book offering you a recommended bet. I don't think they want you to win in the long run so in general I would do the opposite of what they're saying is going to happen because they have no repercussions from being "wrong" (with their public predictions) and there's nothing stopping jamie from having his traders inverse what he's saying.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 14:06:37'] I think you are playing with fire here, bro.  CPI numbers are probably going to be low and will cause this market to rally unnecessarily.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 05:44:30'] I’m beginning to think this dumbass is lying. Snap never ruined his life. Judging by the fact that he made ten grand in this situation and decided to hold into cpi which is the quintessential definition of gambling, what ruined his life is greed and having no exit plan, this is the kind of moron that even apple cratered this morning he would’ve held into Friday thinking he could make more money. Sheer greed and stupidity.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-18 19:05:10'] I think if apple doesn’t hit their earnings then the market will tank. That whole week could be real bad. If apple doesn’t hit earnings plus a negative GDP on the same day. And the FOMC I mean it could be real bad. I personally don’t really know if they will hit it or not. I know iPhones and macs have seen huge demand but apple did say they expected billions more in cost.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 03:56:06'] Weirdly, I think they'll do alright. Yesterday's guidance implied things are about to shit the bed, meaning "shitting the bed" has now been priced in, and they can miss earnings without losing 30% of their value. Yeah, it'll probably go down, but not as bad as some people think might.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 15:53:24'] Apple forecast a $4-$8 billion hit last quarter. That's a pretty wide range and I haven't heard that it's been updated. They've lost a lot of China sales because of Zero COVID and a lot of products have been delayed, again due to Zero COVID. They are raising prices on their products and are executing reasonably well considering all of the headwinds. So I really just see a ton of uncertainty.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-09 00:04:57'] way back in my youth, a couple friends of mine bought Apple stock, like $500 worth each, this around mid 1983. They proceded to watch it plummet and the rumor was Apple was about to go bankrupt so they dumped it at like a 50% loss so they'd at least have something.If they had kept their shares that $500 would be worth $475,000 plus the dividends.

It's easy for any professional trader to say that you guys are idiots but I respect what you do, so no hate on my end. Trading is calculated gambling at the end of the day anyway. Compared to you guys, I'm basically a boring stock trader but damn good at it. AAPL is my baby.\n\nI'm a swing trader on the 15min chart and 5min, just depends on the price action. I obviously don't win every trade but I shoot for large profits held over 1-3 days so losses don't matter. Willing to help any newbs sometimes and show you what my targets are on certain days when I see good bets.\n\nCurrent:\n\nFor anyone that messaged me in chat, reddit clears out chats that are too far down on the list so if you don't hear from me in the next day or 2 then I've lost you!

Now? Who cares! As long as it works and the battery keeps a charge, I'll keep it for over two years.\n\nAAPL is one of the few stocks that have yet to plummet back to reality and I believe the market will continue to fall, bringing even AAPL with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo positions yet but targeting AAPL 120P Nov"

This last cycle was a blowout so I’d say there are more than enough people who still get excited about smart phones..especially with all these idiots Tik Tok’ing. You might still print on the $120P (I hope not, fuck you lol), but I think it’ll be more a symptom of the market and not for lack of phone buying. I mean really, would you save $10/month to have a shitty phone for the next 2 years?? I sure as fuck wouldn’t.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 23:18:15'] What about on a company fleet level? Our company upgraded everyone to iPhone 12 recently.  Our company switched from Samsung over 6 years ago and never looked back.  All I’m saying is, a lot of fleet companies use iPhone. If they are not being cheap right now, and more deals and upgrades are rolled out, then bullish it is.  Then again, what goes up must come down.

POST_TEXT: b'\n\nWhy the recession seems to not be happening.. in most places.\n\nBasically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \n\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they dont keep up with AI, wont make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasnt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \n\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will '

Buying stuff just for bragging rights doesn't seem to be that much of a thing anymore. From what I see people "brag" about not wasting money on the apple product but rather opting for the far cheaper alternative.Does anyone remember how in the early to late 2000's we here in the West had this culture around excessive consumption and bragging and flaunting wealth? It was in a lot of our pop culture even pop songs and music videos started implementing advertising in the lyrics (Nelly shilling shoes is an infamous example) Today in many ways feels like the opposite of those times. And it's kind of nice.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-11 06:06:11'] I'm not an options player so I'm sure this is a bad take and I'm mostly writing it so someone can explain why to me. But I'd either hold them or roll them further away. Note that this isn't a casino play at this point- you have a fantastic position for a long term return.When you took this screenshot, AAPL was about $175. So $40 over your strike, and the bid/ask is in the low 50s. Doesn't seem to me like you're getting a lot of credit for the time remaining on deep ITM leaps.I'd expect to see it go up a lot more in the next year and you can realize a lot more of that growth. They're up 50% on the year. If they do that again, it'll be at $270 in a year and you'll be sitting on multiples of your current profit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-11 04:44:08'] If you don’t wanna sell just use a safe trailing stop and walk away. But you risk it every time you hold overnight.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:02:28'] Book value is kinda meaningless to software companies. You can have software that everyone wants to license or subscribe to, but the "book" value is basically 0, since it's not a "real" asset. Apple also has a lot of value in its brand which isn't reflected in book value either.You can probably buy a real estate company that's like 1-to-1 book to stock price, but that just means its value is the sum of its holdings. Doesn't mean you should invest in it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:58:38'] Book value isn't a very useful metric for software heavy companies. Imagine a pure software company. Their book value is some laptops and some servers and some chairs and a refrigerator. But the software sells well and the margins are very high, because once you have the software written, costs to sell one more copy is almost zero. So the company has value based on the revenue and profits and almost no value based on stuff it owns. Apple has a huge software component in its valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 18:57:41'] A bunch of highly regarded people in here that can't read a balance sheet nor a cash flow statement. Forget all that rubbish about software companies having a low book value. Book value is primarily impacted by three things: net income, share issuance, and capital return.Apple's BVPS keeps falling because of the buyback. Just look at their Common Stock line item and their retained earnings. When Apple repurchases shares, that common stock falls by (0.00001 + issuance price) * shares repurchased. The retained earnings falls by the (price paid per share repurchased - issuance price - 0.00001) * shares repurchased. Retained earnings also falls due to Apple's dividend.Retained earnings = Previous period RE + Net Income - Dividends - Preferred Dividends - Share repurchases. Apple does $100 bn in net income, buys back $90 bn in stock, and pays out $15 bn in dividends. If they didn't return capital to shareholders, you would see their book value skyrocket by $100 bn. Apple will have a negative book value if they keep returning all cash generated to shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:08:18'] AAPL is not a good value by this metric, but there is more involved in valuing a company than price/book ratio. There are a lot of good companies that have a lower price/book than BABA too. I personally put a lot of weight on that when picking a stock to hold long term. Definitely not the only factor though
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 23:37:07'] BABA 🚀 target 186
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:20:43'] >You're missing the fact that I'm rich and intelligent, which means I know better than everyone else. AAPL is a great company and will continue to go up, while BABA is overvalued and will eventually come crashing down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:57:08'] I mean I'm seeing a book value of 386 on baba. Which would be even more absurd. And no I didn't miss a decimal point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:26:14'] Book value is physical goods. BABA sells sh\*t so they have a ton of stuff they can liquidate. Apple on the other hand have patents and stuff in a holding or the app store so there's no physical value on these but it doesn't mean they don't make a ton of money. Book value is absolutely bad to measure companies against each other it's more for specific types of companies where it makes sense.Imagine you sell paintings. The book value of a painting is the frame, paper and colors that you can still sell for scrap or on a flee market but the Mona Lisa is worth way more even if the book value is probably less than $100.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:58:45'] Ignoring the China aspect, this is basically the cliffnotes version of Benjamin Graham and early Warren Buffett. If you buy a stock that's priced lower than it's real value, it's almost certainly going to rise at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:54:19'] Value is a popularity contest
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:55:49'] No one values a company for their current fixed assets and investment portfolios. They care much more about the ability to generate growing free cash flows. The cash flows either get paid to the shareholders or spent to increase the company’s assets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 17:21:01'] Retail businesses aren't worth much more than their inventory, aside from potentially logistics and real estate.Technology companies have troves of copyrights and patents, which are free recurring revenue.Intellectual property and brand value are explicitly not part of book value---and AAPL has both.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 17:29:54'] Enterprise value.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 17:58:36'] Absolutely not correct. Book value is historical cost accounting of assets not fair values.  BABA may/probably has a lot of impaired assets as well that should be written down. The intellectual property and DCF of AAPL are worth way more than the sum of its tangible assets on its books, and that results in its stock price. Stick to mutual funds dude.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 21:13:47'] Relationship between China and US is worsening. Any Chinese stock is going to go down because of uncertainties.Don't touch Chinese stocks unless you hear US China relationships improve.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 21:24:21'] Ah yes the book value trap....First, read the balance sheet to make sure the book value is legitimate.Second, its a chinese company...so you literally can't trust anything they say/write.Third, that's not even that big of a discount.If you care about book value there's WAY better deals out there. For example, LUMEN and PACW are trading at ridiculous P/B values of less than 0.3 iirc. Obviously there is a reason for the low P/B and its that investors are worried for one reason or another.

Apple has put themselves in a corner. And there is no turning back. \n\nThe new iPhone will not come out in September.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-07 19:25:35'] The dollar is strong and only getting stronger. That means that any iPhone sold outside the US (in a non-dollar currency) is now getting less margins. Unless they can make the difference by selling more (hard since we are in a recession), apple will be hit hard in the earning season. (Not too bad tho, since it’s kinda priced in when MSFT announced their currency situation).Also - their long term strategy of borrow at  <1% and use the debt to buy shares is becoming harder to execute as rates go up.Apple will be okay, but not the play in the macro environment.

Then suddenly when all hope is lost an ape army of investors sends your investment soaring and you can now buy a dozen keys to get on your feet. Hope that dude doesn't go back to prison.

Bad sign. AAPL gonna fall today and or tomorrow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-15 07:06:45'] Buy and hold guys. Only thing what you need to do is hold. Don't panic. AMC price target $100, but if a lot of new shorters enter at all time high price target $150.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-15 08:02:18'] AMC on the verge of bankruptcy was worth $5. So how much is AMC with an ape-backed capital infusion and reduced debt worth? Worst case, this heads back to its "real" valuation (my guess, $15-20). Best case, this climbs back into the 50s with a chance to rocket even higher. At these levels, I'll take my chances on going long. See you all in Valhalla.

POST_TEXT: b"Missed the $NFLX ER? You and everyone else is currently looking at the next $NFLX like earnings play. One thing is for sure, tech earnings will be volatile and results at the tail end will be more likely than usual. Tail ends are usually hard to predict and the statistic models that calculate premiums usually underestimate them. So it might be the best time to steal from thetagang.\n\nThat said, I think we'll see two types of tech ER scenarios going forward. Type 1 will be a $NFLX repeat, taking everyone by surprise. More likely will be type 2, everyone is getting scared and the stock tanks before ER and goes up after or stays flat. \n\nLet's look at next week, afaik all of these are after hours:\n\n**Tuesday -  $MSFT**\n\n\nDown 13.5% from ATH (historically a lot for Microsoft). \n\nP/E is 33.11, EPS is in a healthy uptrend (P/E - price / earnings, EPS - earnings per share).\n\nI think this will be type 2: will tank like the rest of the market before Tues, but the actual ER will be fine.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 06:08:20'] MSFT will be solid. Definitely long on any pullback.HOOD is to obvious, so it’ll prolly inverse and rocket up for some reason lol. Who knows. I like the V play.  They’ll report well, but not provide guidance, which will push it down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 10:44:31'] Great discussion here. These are the threads that I enjoy most. I like Tesla in terms of innovation & their domination of the EV market, along with their solar business. With that said, I am bearish on the company. No one can maintain these crazy valuations in this environment. Also, during economic downturns, automotive is the first to take the hit. Taking inflation, PPI, rising interest rates, supply chain issues, increasing competition, etc into consideration...Tesla may find itself in a tight spot in the not so distant future. Don't get me wrong, the company is here to stay, but it won't stop the stock price from returning to a more realistic valuation. The euphoria will die off rather quickly once the big money decides to start heading for the exit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 07:49:09'] TSLA is the holy grail of short such a bloated P/E . This could be the reckoning
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 05:40:41'] Put your nuts on the line. Make a decision and quit sounding like Jim Cramer.The Federal Reserve has just reiterated they are going to raise rates 3X this year (and money is in a full blown panic).Apple at almost 30x earnings (which is held as an inflation hedge for alot of the Scandinavian sovereigns over the last decade) is going south.Telsa 600x earnings provided the reason for its CEO to dump $20 billion dollars worth of stock in the last 90 days. Did you listen to what Elon said about "others are valuing my company"? It's going south.VISA is scrambling to catch up with blockchain technology (by partnering with Coinbase and whomever else will allow it to get their legacy sticky fingers into their decentralized ecosystems). It's going south.Here are 3 easy picks. Take one or all. Fear and greed is what fuels the algorithms that provide 87% of the market trading volume in 2022.Don't over think this stuff.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 09:54:49'] I have HOOD calls and shares that I bought two weeks ago, all my my money is on HOOD & I lost more than half of my initial money. Do you guys suggest I sell my calls and shares on Monday? I thought HOOD would rise. Please advise me. It is a lot of money for me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 12:26:32'] Gonna buy more on HOOD. Squeeze play here. Almost of of the available shares are used for shorting. There are only 75k shares left to short.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 12:52:26'] Msft down 10% from ATHs but 33P/E is rock solid historical for the company, and MSFT imo better positioned than ever to keep growing at phenomenal rate.  Why no AMZN btw? 22% off ATH, branching into groceries, AWS still growing, etc, etc?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 12:53:59'] Netflix was entirely obvious when they raised subscription prices a week before earnings. That was the not so subtle GTFO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 09:14:23'] HOOD will be bought out in a couple years. Great entry point here for long term hold.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 12:57:45'] I think Tesla is going down, I think guidance will be lowered due to global supply issues and the current economic issues globally ( almost all countries are reporting insane inflation numbers ) they also had a major recall and their stock didn’t move very much. Also they have another huge gap to fill to 880

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 05:43:31'] Intel just made that huge move of investing 20b in Ohio chip making facility. IMO I feel like this stoink is poised for great moves. Especially since the market is about to give long bulls juicy discounts on all our fave stonks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 07:09:53'] Hey, been following your posts as I start to dive in to TA for daily scalping. So far have just been using all kinds of MAs and EMAs + RSI. Could you share more about what methods you’re using here and why these targets make sense? Consider it as purely for the educational value so I too can have a few more wrinkles
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-31 02:14:47'] The one thing I believe is that you were outside GameStop. I have never seen anyone actually in one of those stores and every one of them looks like it is about to go out of business where it does not look like it has seen new paint in 25 years and half the neon lights are burnt out.

As an American, even if we don't have any money were gonna go into debt on shit we want because "we deserve it".  In our new post covid reality we're desperate to go vacation and trying to get rich quick gambling on sports.   Airlines are doing well so by extension I think other forms of travel and hospitality are going to see some gains as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 13:28:26'] Who wants to talk about Wingstop (WING)? It's seems pricey. It's near the top. But they are well managed, and the cost of chicken wangs have been falling over the past 12 months. Anyone have any empirical data if you eat there? Does it appear to be progressively getting busier? Does your store have help-wanted signs (bullish for need: bearish for wage) - still good to know.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:27:23'] PE is only about half of what you need to look at when evaluating growth oriented companies.  You want to look at PEG ratios, which take into account not just the current value, but the growth rate.GOOG may have a PE of around 20, but it has a growth rate of \~27% annual.  Peter Lynch has used a simple metric of PE = growth rate to value companies (this method is close to using the PEG equation).The mega caps aren't over valued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 14:10:03'] A low P/E is a good sign of stable growth without loading up on debt or diluted stock shares. AAPL has a P/E of 23, very good, and a Net Margin (Profit) of 27%. In contrast, TWTR has a P/E of 202 and Net Margin of 4.27%, meaning not keeping up with 8% inflation.    It is weird finding out Dorsey only held on to 2.5% shares. That means he never believed in the corporation and had been selling off controlling interest in shares the past 10 years. Dorsey is an example of a CEO selling off shares after IPO to finance the corporation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:09:39'] I heard somewhere that if you are talking about PE ratio means you don't know what you talking about.

POST_TEXT: b'Since the middle of June 2022, the Apple Plunge Protection Liquidity Engineers (APPLE) have been using their 3 Trillion dollar hedge fund money to aggressively and assertively guarantee that AAPL stock goes up in a straight line.  Seriously, go look at the chart, it\'s absolutely uncanny.  \n\nThis is with no new actual news from Apple, nothing about better phones, better laptops, nothing about new Apple Watches or new services.   Just Tim Apple telling his people "Do so many Stock Buybacks that the stock price makes an UNMISTAKABLE LINE STRAIGHT UP."\n\nThis should be the only thing anyone is talking about.  Stock that was 130 two months ago is 175 today, guaranteed to be 180 tomorrow and 200 not long afterwards. \n\nYet every single chumchugger on this web sight is talking about nothing but Bed Bath and Beyond.   \n\nAAPL and the APPLE team are very angry about this development.   Financial engineering so blatantly obvious so as to guarantee profits for anyone who buys AAPL shares.  And this '

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 22:48:41'] Lmao you're an idiot. It was 130 because SPY was sucking dick <380 due to various reasons whether it was the economy or the looming potential of a WW3, etc. And Apple always goes up. There's a reason why it's considered one of the safest stocks to invest into for long-term. Imagine someone basically putting everything into it at 130 or 140. Guaranteed profits.

There's only one answer to that: they do it on purpose.  They are a captured entity, and Congress needs to wake the fuck up to that fact.And *they do* have other tools than raising rates... they are not engaged in QT as they should be, and *no one* asks them why they are sitting with an absolute fuckton of capital in the reverse repos, instead of selling crap off the balance sheet to suck that liquidity out of the markets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 18:52:16'] She is such an idiot.   Did she complain when they were pumping the economy that got us here?  Inflation hurts everyone,  some higher unemployment hurts some people, some people take advantage of the situation to get training for better jobs. This is just a "look at me" moment for Warren. Recessions sadly are part of a healthy economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 20:09:04'] Ok Liz…what caused the inflation to begin with? It ain’t the Feds responsibility to save jobs due to the fiscal environment the government created! What’s the alternative Liz, do nothing and let inflation run us all into the ground? Who benefits from high inflation? That’s right, you know….certainly not the working poor and middle class. So either companies trim costs (labor) or everyone poor gets poorer. Fucking genius people who vote for these idiots. We’re fucked.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 04:18:44'] The real problem is covid made companies realize that consumer are willing to pay double the amount for goods and service. They are able to do that because in many industries in the US there is no real competition. The job market is not the problem. The real wage increase have not caught up. Workers today have less purchasing power than 40 years ago. We are not buying more shit, it’s the companies making less to jack up their profit margins.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:14:56'] If they want to reduce inflation by removing money from circulation, reduce interest for poorer borrowers, increase the points for those with high income. No more .5% loans in the trillions of dollars to banking and Wall Street. Tax the fuck out of the rich and corporations and stop squeezing your average American.

POST_TEXT: b"AAPL is the greatest short investment i've ever seen the market present to investors for the following reasons;\n\n\\-AAPL normally trades at 12-22PE during a decade of HIGH growth;\n\n\\-AAPL now is expecting to grow at 1-4% YOY and trades 30-60% above it's average valuation (31PE);\n\n\\-Demand has been pulled forward years in advance, and its the kind of demand that is not re-occurring. You don't buy a new Macbook every year and the Iphone's hardly change at this point;\n\n\\-Even the AAPL car at best would bring in 10 Billion by 2026. The market cap is 3 trillion NOW, it's insignificant and laughable;\n\n\\-China is imploding with real estate being 25% of GDP they are going into a harsh recession now that Evergrande has defaulted. AAPL sales will likely decline.\n\n\\-WSB has presented Wallstreet with a once in a life time opportunity. Wallstreet invests a massive amount of money in AAPL and FAANG since they have huge market caps that allow them to store a vast amount of their wealth into. Wallstree"

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-10 13:21:23'] I think AAPL Continues to climb because it is institutional tech....sexy enough to be a tech stock, but old enough to be a real company with a mega consumer base. Also China is looking scary so US tech looks more appealing because it will weather (even gain) from an Evergrande meltdown as the Chinese economy will tank, AAPL will be able to keep wages low in iPhone City and probably expand their production. I bought some for my wife in her 401(k) and will probably buy some more if we see another dip. It will grow 5-10% minimum for the next few years and if they get in the EV game with Hyundai it could go bananas

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:21:11'] It feels like one of those really cool proof of concepts that you see at CES that never actually makes it to market. Yes it's cool...but not practical yet. It has a 2 hour battery life. This is considered acceptable because it's also heavy and not comfortable to wear on your face for a long time. One of the things they spent the most time showing off is how it's great to just sit back and watch a movie. If it's not comfortable enough to wear for a long time and the battery is less than 90% of movies being release now days then the primary entertainment use case is gone. Using it as a a multi monitor office is also not practical...other VR products have tried it. There are definitely some cool concepts in it but it's not there yet...and 90% of the cool stuff is available in other VR products.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 13:04:59'] Yeah, $3500 for a product that has not *proved* anything it claims to deliver is definitely the way forward!!1!Hype your stupidity as much as you want, [it's not making price turn around any time soon](https://i.imgur.com/Gvu7QzL.png).Apple's real market is USA and China. USA because, well, USA. Buying overpriced junk to fit in with the crowd is just tradition there. And China is ironically very much like USA on that matter. In addition to that, Tim Cook is in bed with CCP (maybe literally), and has happily handed over not only user data, but entire data centers to be controlled by CCP officials. On top of that, when CCP so commands, Apple pulls apps from its store, which Hong Kong protestors were using to coordinate their events.Apple will make money because it's more depraved than most depraved companies out there. Not because they slapped a moronic price on a moronic fad that went nowhere, after years of hype.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:47:24'] Apple is a different type of company. They do things in their own way. They reward shareholders with Buybacks. They have a healthy cash balance. They pioneer platforms and collect shady fees from developers. This shit is going to be legendary. It doesn't matter that some people will hate it. The potential for new and immersive experiences will be unleashed by Apple. The possibilities in gaming, education, home office spaces and porn alone will take apple to the fucking moon. While everyone was losing their shit over a semi useful AI chatbot, Apple did what Apple does. Make expensive shit that everyone wants to buy. Again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 12:57:29'] >There are a few reasons why you shouldn't invest everything you have into Apple stock. First, no company is immune to market fluctuations and there is always the potential for Apple's stock price to go down. Second, investing all of your money in one company leaves you vulnerable if that company experiences financial difficulties. Finally, diversifying your investments helps protect against losses in any single investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 15:01:43'] TL;DR AAPL is getting hyped for the wrong reasons despite raising the bar on VR technologies. They're instead a strong company backed by major financial institutions and have continued to build a robust and exclusive technology ecosystem.&#x200B;Is AAPL bullish? Yes.Is it entirely because of VR? No.There's too much information and history pointing to VR being a flop. It's a technology that is worth developing but it's just *not quite there yet*. Again, AAPL hasn't cracked the code on this... yet.I say yet, because they actually have a strong shot at taking this technology to the next level, and the reason why is because of their steady focus on size reduction, aesthetic and face tracking technology. We use our faces to express ourselves, this is a major stumbling block in VR where while it may be entertaining, there's still the ever-present feeling that you're either in costume or hanging out with a bunch of puppets. Size and aesthetic are just a given, the current headsets on the market look ridiculous and uncool.Apple is also arguably better at monetization than Facebook has been, and I strongly believe that metaverse developers will step up their game to meet any extra demand brought on by AAPL products, which will increase competition and enrich the community. If you look at the situation as an economist, we all know monopolies aren't efficient in the long run. We need more players in the game like AAPL to spur on further innovation.Despite all that, that's still not the reason AAPL is bullish in my book. Apple has continued to deepen its ties to financial technology and offers a card backed by Goldman Sachs, the second largest bank *in the world.* Goldman Sachs is a titan in the financial industry and has backing from some of the most elite supporters such as Blackrock and Vanguard.The apple card that I mentioned above is made all the more useful with its integration through apple pay, this might not sound like a major innovation but it's a strong addition to the Apple ecosystem of technology from a business standpoint. Apple earns money on interest paid on these cards, which will likely provide small but stable profit for years to come.Does this lead me to believe that AAPL is a rocket? No. But I do still have confidence in them to stay in some sort of weird area between being a value and a growth stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 03:15:58'] this thing will silently disappear from the consumer market. They are not creating something new but catching up to the other tech companies. there have been headsets now for literally decades and none of them became really relevant for a mass market.

Nothing was priced in for that reaction 80% of the time stocks rallied. NOT stayed the same, that my friend, is not priced in. Priced in does not take, “it doesn’t go down”. it means there will be very little movement. It DOES NOT MATTER WHICH SIDE.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 23:57:02'] By definition the consensus for economic data is priced in, if data deviates from the consensus significantly the market will move significantly. Or, much more rarely, if a participant with enough buying power thought that data could deviate significantly from the market consensus the market may also move significantly even if the data is in line with market consensus. Setting up a straw man on what “priced in” means doesn’t impress anyone.

Here's what happens if Tomorrow McDonald's announces that "Yes, in fact, the meat is made out of people and there's nothing you can about it." The stock **will plummet**. For like, 5 hours.  Then it'll bounce right back to where it was.  Stocks always react to news like that and then always bounce back. The reason they react is because traders are anticipating that all the dumb dumbs in this subreddit are going to go buy or sell based on the news and they want to front run you.

POST_TEXT: b"Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500s +8%.\n\nHere are what analysts expect:\n\n* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts\n\n* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\n* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)\n\nThey're expecting a drop in Disneys second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. \n"

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-09 12:42:04'] Even if CPI is better than or equal to the estimate Wednesday, I just don’t see it happening anytime soon with earnings coming up followed by GDP report/FOMC. Earnings and guidance are going to be shit, just depends on how shit they actually are. GDP will most likely be negative, as expected, putting us in a technical recession. The news FUD from that alone will probably bring down the markets. A lot of shit happening this month. Unless CPI is lower than expected, earnings are _way_ better than expected due to lowered EPS estimates, guidance isn’t doom and gloom for Q3/Q4, and GDP is better than expected, then I don’t see any reason for Apple, along with the rest of the market, to keep pumping past these levels. $150~ top for now on Apple is what I see.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-09 12:37:04'] With the recent AMZN split as well as upcoming GME, GOOGL and TSLA splits. I believe, investors will likely sell % of AAPL to buy something else. All of them are fighting for retail investors to buy. If AAPL does reach 160 aka pump, then watch out for the predictable dump (100 to 125).

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 08:41:30'] I hold both but I went all in apple post split at 112 made some trade long covered calls but I'm still holding 3000 shares. AMD in bought in 2018 at 15 and I am still holding 2000 shares. For the first time I'm selling the earnings pop or protecting whatever the run up price is with a stop loss and I'll get back in with puts. I'm doing that only due to the lack of supply. Apple I have 155 calls and 145 puts but I am holding my position through. I think the earnings beat is baked in already but I'm expecting they will be announcing the new AR this quarter and I hold and capture the middle in options. I think apple has lagged all year despite its recent run and it cod have legs left. My opinion only. I will get back into amd most likely 82 to 85 after it pops to 95 and drops . Fingers crossed. I am deciding while I type if I want to go larger on upside calls and to what risk I'm willing to expose myself to.

Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. \n\nFor those apes that are new and dont understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then burn them into thin air. \n\nWhat are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs. \n\nId keep stacking shares and buy long expiration calls whenever apple dips 5%'

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 10:00:47'] > Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then “burn” them into thin airThat's not how that works.They buy shares at market price using their profits. They then HOLD the shares to an indefinite amount of time.They can sell those shares at market price anytime they want.The actual number of shares outstanding is still the same. Whether they buy back or sell, they outstanding shares is the same.However, the share float is artificially lower because APPL gobbled up $80b of shares and took them out of the pool.The only way to affect the actual outstanding shares is to:1. Reverse split to reduce float.2. Split to increase float.3. Issue new shares to increase float (this is considered dilution).

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 12:31:05'] Share buybacks are only a part of the picture, you have to look at share price and share earnings.  Ok, Apple bought back 3% of its market cap.  That means 3% of this year's EPS was not from organic growth.  Apple has had flat earnings and a flat share price so the fact that a massive buyback was needed to sustain that is not necessarily the best thing.

Why ? its called 'Brand Fatigue'.

POST_TEXT: b"So Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting is live at the moment of this post. And Buffett was asked about Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, and his response was that Apple is an excellent business, better than all of their other holdings. One of their best stakes basically etc, so Monday come and Apple will probably rip up to 180. That'll drag the SPY up a huge level and the majority of stock market too with it. There goes my 5/10 411 SPY puts to 0 should have taken the tiny profits I had. Cheers to those who have SPY/QQQ calls, and time for bears to go behind a Wendy's dumpster.\n\nSource: Cnbc youtube coverage on Apple (not sure if I can post Youtube links, but I think you can't)\n\n**Disclaimer:** For the record I don't have any position in Aapl or any calls for SPY.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:41:39'] Market makers want to see 417+ before CPI and if CPI comes in better then expected it will rip to 430 where I will load up to the tits on puts expiring in July-august.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:01:07'] I haven’t traded AAPL in a long time, but the rule used to be, when everyone is hyping it up, that’s when you sell. Maybe not buy puts, but go to cash. Like, when the rhetoric gets extreme - they can do no wrong, the valuation will go over a trillion bucks (this was a while back), Tim Cook is from an alien civilization that perfected supply chain science, etc. Get out of the stock. Then when the rhetoric goes to the other extreme - rumors of a Samsung/Google phone that will eat Apple’s lunch, rumors of Foxconn factories shutting down, rumors of Gen Z kids thinking Apple’s not cool, etc. When it gets to the extreme of AAPL’s about to go bankrupt and everyone is bearish - then buy, because the stock is about to rip. Dunno if that guidance holds true anymore… but the OP makes me immediately bearish.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:12:38'] Aapl to $200. Long live Tim apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:11:55'] He’s gonna start selling apple next week when it pumps
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:28:07'] Of course he’s going to say its an excellent business. He’s ball deep in AAPL. Are you surprised he said this? He’s been saying this for years
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:03:13'] Apple is at ATH on declining iPhone and Mac sales
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 13:14:28'] Cramer liked apple. You might be okay.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:54:53'] There will come a time to short Apple. It is NOT now
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 17:03:22'] It amazes me, people look at the most profitable company in the history of mankind and think “hmm. Imma bet against that”.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:09:41'] >You're an idiot if you think Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple is a good thing. The only reason they have it is because Buffett knows that the company is overvalued and he's hoping to cash in on the inevitable crash. Don't be fooled by his rhetoric, he's just trying to pump up the price so he can sell at a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:03:11'] Was this not expected after the Q1 reports from the other big tech names?Q1 earnings season wasn't "as bad" as initially feared. We are now 14 months into this tightening cycle. A lot of companies have been reporting declining sales in the negative 20-30% range YoY.  FED is going to raise again in June...  Q2 is going to be when the market wakes up to the real picture.Patience. There will be blood.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 21:53:12'] Apple has so much cash. It takes cash to beat everyone at R&D. When times are tough for the competition they all cut their R&D budgets. Apple is still coming up with the cutting edge technology that will make me $$$
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 17:44:49'] AAPL is just one product or another genius play away from another 50%, 2-3 year growth run.  It's not if, but when and that's what keeps the valuation sky high.  TBH, I will probably be buying iPhones for as long as they make them and so will the other hundreds of millions of people around the world.  There are just too many avenues they could go down to monopolize on the next decade long trend and long term, declines in the stock price are just that, an opportunity to start/add to your position.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:14:26'] Pumps his own book harder than he pumps his gfs. He’s not wrong though, and your puts are for sure fuckt. There’s millions of millennial 401ks buying the market every 2 weeks on payday, and shorts have been covering on every dip for months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:24:55'] Appl looks like it’ll go down Monday. That $170 threshold is too strong on it. It’ll trade sideways as usual. Why? Because I got hella humbled on my calls

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 06:59:00'] Ppl who thinks apple is a bad pick for Berkshire really don’t understand how they evaluate companies, you guys would sell everything that BRK owns if that was up to some of you , insurance? Rail roads ? Getting business that make real money and a lot of it is a good business to have , betting on moon shots and “growth” companies that barely make any money is not how BRK invest
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 01:32:47'] I can't wait for Apple to collapse... Which will happen, although not sure how soon
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 13:01:56'] &#x200B;&#x200B;It's no surprise that Buffett is bullish on Apple, given their long-term success and the fact that they have been a major part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for years. However, it's important to remember that the stock market is unpredictable, and even the most experienced investors can get it wrong sometimes. With that in mind, I think it's wise to do your own research and make your own decisions when it comes to investing. That being said, Apple does look like it could be a good bet for the near future, so it might be worth considering if you're looking for a good investment opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 10:23:56'] Well not for SPY short run but a recession is bullish for long run, and even intermediate term for regional banks.  If rates drop then unrealized losses on debt instruments evaporate and the banks are fine.  For all other industry it’s bad short run but good long run as it will set up the next bull market.  I don’t think I would buy SPY right now but beleaguered assets due to high rates might be an amazing bargain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-27 16:08:46'] Because if it was easy to throw a linear regression model onto a stock using how it correlates with other stocks, anyone with basic python skills could become a billionaire pretty easily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-27 18:28:23'] Lol, why such a big difference? Because EPS is not a linear trend. You are using literally the most basic statistical tool incorrectly. If anything, you would expect earnings growth to be exponential (i.e. 1% every quarter).  On top of that, you have no controls and not nearly a large enough sample to actually make a meaningful estimate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-28 04:43:36'] did you factor in the cumshots correlation in the air, at any given point in your graph? thought you not. You MAY think it's 0, but if it's not.... you're off

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:56:08'] Your missing two interesting facts in you analysis which I think are pretty valuable:RSP significantly underperformed SPY (RSP is the equal weight version of SPY). This basically suggests that as many have insinuated, the market has been dragged higher by the mega caps. With Amazon and Google missing and Apple faltering, if we lose those I think there is a bias to a significant downside.Also of note is that the majority of stocks trade below their 200-day moving averages, in other words, most stocks are trending lower. Couple these items together and it’s sort of a receipt for further downsides to the market. Do I think we crash, No I really don’t think so. Do I think we could go 10% lower, that is a definite possibility.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 08:00:55'] It’s a poor comparison because a parts maker can never achieve the same type of customer loyalty as an AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 14:57:00'] I would like to reinforce your mind. I'm not sure if Apple is a good comparison, maybe from a growth perspective. NVIDIA is going to have their business in just about everything tech for the next 30 years and so on. I think we see not only massive growth or super growth but retard growth. More autonomous cars will help, but I think the big kicker will be robots. They will take over pretty much all the manual labor and dangerous work. It wont even take that long either as I believe we've reached the apex of the exponential growth curve. NVIDIA is great stock. I've owned it and AMD for several years now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-29 00:36:16'] There are also many new companies trying to make specialized AI chips nowadays.

You post this like you stumbled on something nobody else has. Also Apple is the Apple of this generation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 14:46:23'] Nvidia is going to crush AI and ML compute sectors. They stand alone far ahead of everyone. All their money comes from GPUs right now  They will be worth a trillion by 2025.Data center/networkingGamingAI / ML / Deep learning:-Medical-Autonomous vehiclesEtcARM deal is massive if it goes through. All these technologies and innovations allows Nvidia to have vertical integration.Their development community is big, easy and affordable to get into. Their vision and execution is far bigger than producing processors as a simple semi conductor company.They will be worth 1+ trillion by 2025. Probably multiples by end of the decade.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 21:19:58'] NVDA is basically of the same generation as AAPL and worth a fuck ton for quite a while already…so the whole premise is silly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 21:21:22'] I like NVDA but think BB Blackberry is setting up to have Apple like growth over the next 10 years. It has excellent products in both cyber and IoT vertical; many high profile clients and partners including governments, large corporations, banks etc; new partnerships almost weekly, any many more promising reasons. When Ivy starts brining in recurring revenue, I truly believe this can run up to $500+ per share within the next 5 years.Disclaimer.I own both nvda and BB shares so not trying to sway people over to BB. I personally think it is good to own both. They both have a big role to play in EV vehicles as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 11:07:40'] It's already priced in for the next 10 years. Apple in 1990 was only 20 cents if you compare it to today's price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 10:27:49'] Here's my hot take on machine learning:  its wide spread use will result in software facing tort law liability (something to which it has been completely shielded from to this day).  This will cause *all* software to stop being deflationary.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 12:36:41'] Was in NVDA at 46, split adjusted around out at $535Was in aapl at around $2 out at $135.The Market cap on each of these is way out of hand.I am in cash looking for the next trend. In ENPH at $32Solar marketing a trend but also getting overpriced.To me one of the best options s is the silver market right now. Also real estate trusts ha e been a good long term investment ABR. May be high right now.$1.40/div.Dont be afraid to take profits.If you have a good entry point sell otm calls for income.Getting to your prove me wrong point, you are late to the party on NVDA for the main growth. Find the next NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 17:13:06'] You are on a silver focused board, what did you expect?The fact is: the market is way overbought and ready to go down.The question is.....do you risk a 10% upside for a 60% downside?Silver is undervalued here. You are not late to the party, but right on time. Regarding stocks, and where we are right now in the market:Watch the lunch scene in wolf of wall st with Matt McConaughey and Leonardo DeCapria."It's all fugazzy"  it's not real......It's only real when you sell.Right now I would be in hard assets, real estate and PM.(You are late to the real estate market)

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-29 01:13:25'] The only thing giving nvda their high multiple is AI for which they're first movers but imo their moat for AI is not great and ripe for competition before the major revenue for it starts rolling in.Also to join FAAMG the CEO has to be memeable which Chen isn't, I'd back su bae over him of the two.In terms of memeable CEOs though Sq and Pltr are the clear choices

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 15:25:18'] Stars are aligning for a further sell off.VIX on the rise breaking through resistance, SPY breaking that support to finally drop out of that consolidation channel and closing literally $0.01 above LOD was very bearish imo.Dollar strengthening and yields climbing too apparently.The rally in tech still is absurd imo. Treated like a safe haven? Why would people buy into growth stocks with insane PEs in the current environment if there's a risk free yield of over 5% is beyond me.I'm still bearish and hope my puts can climb out of the grave lol.Congrats on the great trading week so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 16:20:40'] For Friday's expiration most of the calls are at 4150 and most of the puts are 4050 are so MM's try hit somewhere between. Perfect area is at 4130-4145. This is just based on maximum pain theory and even that it's pretty accurate it misses here and there. I expect that there is nothing happening this week and everyone waits for next week before making moves.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 14:17:30'] How are we still holding the 411.6 to 413.5 range on spy when we closed at 410.25 today?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 15:30:46'] Don’t fall for the bear trap. If we were to have broken the range, you would have seen a big red candle all the way down to 408 on BIG volume with no stopping and everyone would have been aware of the news driving it. The market is not going anywhere, possibly till June. I still remain bullish this week and bought calls on all the small caps for tomorrow. Bears took their shot last week and it’s now the bulls turn to test the upper range once again. Had an awesome day riding AMD from $99 to $103. What a beast. Now tomorrow my thesis are the small caps will rally, IWM is back on its lower range.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 12:10:38'] >It is certainly possible that NVDA will retest its previous highs before earnings, but it is also worth noting that the stock has been in a bit of a consolidation phase recently. If Jensen Huang delivers strong results on May 24th, we could see the stock breakout to new all-time highs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 14:46:25'] Your top trendline only touches two points. That's not a strong trend. Nvda could be $50 higher and you can draw the same line on two points and call it the resistance
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 14:01:48'] I think the safest short on NVDA is the day before earnings. Would be consistent with other chip stock pre-earning behavior for the stock to sell off the day before earnings. Buy puts two days before, and GTFO before earnings are actually released.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 18:55:38'] Lemme tell you a story. In 2017, i was broke but i did open a play trading account with my bank. I bought NVDA, among other tech stocks. I made a killing in monopoly money, but kicked myself in the nuts for missing out irl. This time around I got in for real when NVDA dumped earlier this year. You know what? I ain’t leaving.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 12:52:23'] It’s been pumping. Time for the dump
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 13:45:00'] As long as SPY and QQQ are holding up Nvidia will. But considering Apple is near ATH and stocks like Microsoft pumping like crazy lately it could end any day now. A pullback is overdue. If 260 breaks it will be a downfall like in April 2022 imoHype‘s already fading. You can see it since QQQ pumps more than Nvidia lately. And if it‘s red Nvidia is way more red

They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.\n\nOver the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 15:02:29'] I'm sorry to say, but I literally couldn't stop laughing for about an hour as I just seen both your post's on PLTR and PYPL. You need to stop playing earnings in this degenerate gambling manner and start scalping the move once earnings are out instead. Alternatively you can inverse your gut feeling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 13:15:18'] It's ok, cause any earnings gains will be balanced out by stock dilution.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 10:34:22'] >It sounds like you're expecting Palantir to report strong earnings, but you're also aware of the potential headwinds that the company is facing. I think buying puts on PLTR is a smart way to play this earnings release. By picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop, you're essentially betting that the stock will drop below $8 per share by May 12th. If it does, you'll make a profit; if not, you'll lose your investment.

The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and Im not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13.\n \nApple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just havent had the chance to be'

Apple could have great earnings and hedge funds could decide to sell to drive the price down.  Or people could decide to pile into the stock and drive it up.   You will find out tomorrow.
