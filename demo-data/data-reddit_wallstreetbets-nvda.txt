	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 09:38:41'] For NVDA to drop, the investment thesis must change. People would need to stop believing in AI. Earnings are irrelevant at this point. The AI hype still has at least a few months to go

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 10:58:43'] It doesn't matter what happen when they already packaged AI as the "next life changing technology" and used iPhones starting the smart phone era as an analogy. Real world tech adoption within the month(eg. fast food chains using ChatGPT to take orders) basically cemented it as a fact. Several investment banks already reported billion dollars worth of panic buying into NVDA, they could have shit earnings and drop, but people will throw money in for every dip possible because they are looking at a 10-20 years timeline. ChatGPT is trained using NVDA, there is nowhere else better to park your money now for AI other than NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 13:00:22'] To add some perspective as someone who works with AI, consumer GPUs don't have enough VRAM. If you want to run AI on your GPU, you're limited to smaller models or you must spend a lot for the larger ones. But it's not *that* far off. Current  higher end GPUs have 12-20GB of VRAM. The smallest model for I think GPT-2 is like 40GB. Once these become available, it's more feasible that you can run this technology locally. Give it another <10 years and you can run these models on your smartphone. There is plenty of room to grow with AI. Nvidia still needs to actually make use of this investment money if they want to succeed here though because big companies are entering the GPU market and may become less dependent on Nvidia.

Then of course there will be competitors but not in a few years. AI is not a bubble. It will only get bigger. If you are skeptical, you have no idea what countries around the world are doing to get ahead of this AI boom. Countries want their own factories.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:10:54'] No one is betting against NVDA itself, rather it's absurd valuation identical to the tech bubble.  Everyone said the internet would revolutionize the world (it did and stocks still got murdered)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:25:41'] Found the top, thanks OP
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 20:34:15'] The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.Look at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.Intel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.All the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.This isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. For all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.I'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). Spurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. Somebody must've had a good fortune cookie.It's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.But nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.Because anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.But do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?Honestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.I don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.Will the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation. Or at least, AI AI AI AI AI AI AI

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 18:45:57'] NVDA will likely fall, not the company but the stock price  (I don't think anyone is believing that the company will have any issue to lead the market with quite an advance), because shit happens independently of companies. (reference: literally just 3 years ago and without such a dramatic example, a bunch of other times).The \`when\` and \`how much\` and \`for how long\` is up in the airs.It is fair to consider that NVDA is overbought, it's fair to be grinning side to side because you entered early, as it is fair to not get depressed for selling too early and not rushing back to enter.And for those that have enough confidence and resources to play with options and bank big, my hat down to them.AI not being a bubble does not prevent the current AI "trend" and how it is marketed to be a bubble.  I don't think it will grow as exponatially fast than it is presented or seem to be believed and I believe that there will be further opportunities later to join the ride.Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm recovering from FOMO and ain't gonna be dragged into a relapse.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 22:42:58'] Except they aren't the only company that can make a spinning Jenny.Intel and AMD both have top quality in every characteristic that defines a GPU.In fact amd and Intel have a major advantage in that they not only have thr GPU they have a Cpu and programmable logic.NVDA is a great company, and I'm 100% long on them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 21:13:30'] NVDA is definitely not the only company that can make the spinning jenny. So can AMD, TSMC, and Intel. And NVDA technology is behind academia, it is just stabilized, scaled up, and commercialized. Combine this with superpower companies and giant governments pouring their cash reserves into chip manufacturing, and I can‚Äôt imagine they keep their competitive advantage for long. NVDA won‚Äôt crash but it is not the Dutch East Indies Company or something.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 21:10:57'] As someone who works for a company that works with nvidia, AI will catapult nvidia even further. AI using gpu compute and what nvidia is doing is revolutionary. Look at their A100 and H100 platforms. MSFT is huge and stayed huge not because of retail, but because of enterprise. Nvidia is is set to do the same thing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 22:03:31'] People who compare now to the first industrial revolution are almost as bad as the people who compare everything to the great depression.There is no technology right now that comparable to going from the horse to the steam engine. From daylight labor to 24 hour factories. From individual construction to mass production.AI just isn't even close. Yes it will probably do some human jobs sooner than expected, but people are out of there minds if they think our social structure is remotely ready to accept fully autonomous drivers, doctors, engineers etc let alone the technology can actually do everything its advertised to do. And it's gonna be a looong time before a robot is building houses or repairing your car.Industrial revolutions are about new forms of *energy*..Horse to coal to oil to fission. Where we are now is an economy with 21st century tech, built on 19 and 20th century energy. I don't have a crystal ball to say NVDA might not go up from here, but I can confidently say this is NOT an industrial revolution and stop drinking from Cathy Woods fruit punch bowl.

There are many potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence, such as machines becoming self-aware and deciding to wipe out humanity (as depicted in popular films like The Terminator). While it is true that AI can be used for beneficial purposes such as improving efficiency in factories or providing better healthcare, there is also the potential for misuse by corrupt governments or individuals.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 01:59:09'] This is the equivalent of the next iteration or evolution of the industrial revolution.However, that doesn‚Äôt mean Nvidia won‚Äôt see a correction before another leg up. It would be safe to assume somewhere in the 20 to 30% range, but it could be more. It could also be less. The important thing to realize is this cycle for Nvidia was based mostly on retail. This means the enterprise cycle hasn‚Äôt started. It is definitely going to be huge, but nothing says, and nobody knows if the stock is going to continue going up immediately, or go down before it goes back up. Statistically based on historical data, it is most likely to experience a slight correction.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:25:56'] There are now many spinning jennies, they are much easier to replicate and produce. Competition will be stiffer and much quicker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:29:42'] Nvidia the company will do fine in the coming years, NVDA the stock is probably gonna see a big dip if J POW ever decides to stop the money printer
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:29:53'] I don‚Äôt think anyone here thinks Nvidia will fail. We just don‚Äôt think it should be trading at 2040 cash flow levels

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:41:03'] You confuse a fab with a design company. NVIDIA has no fab and will be at the mercy of Intel, Samsung, and TSMC. They will also be competing with other companies over fab space.They do not make the spinning jenny, they design it and buy factory space.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 03:40:06'] I heard AMD is making AI chips. Intel is behind in 2025 on making ai chips.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 03:58:43'] Others are already making thier versions of the spinning Genny. And the software moat is being eroded. NVDA has a history on closed standards and not playing nice with other companies. Sure it's made them billions, but that kind of ethos drives customers to competitors. AMD there to pick up the slack. Mi300 is just about ready, and it's a huge leap forward (eclipses H100) . AMD has a huge portfolio now all the way up and down the datacenter stack. They are going to eat into Nvidias AI lunch, the same way they did Intel's. AMD has more room to grow here and it's Nvidia's game to lose. I know where I'm putting my money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 04:01:51'] a GPU is not the only thing you can use to do massive multithreaded computing. Ever heard of RISC, FPGAs and ASICs?Its rather expensive to develop essentially custom hardware to solve a computing problem, however, if you run at scale, it is worth it. Nvidia does not own the market for those, and there will be specialized hardware for AI training, if your theory holds up of it being the end all future of it all.TLDR: Your theory is that Nvidia is the main manufacturer of hammers, and since every handyman needs a hammer, Nvidia will be forever without competition. Thing is thou, there are powertools out there as well that a handyman can use, and Nvidia does not own that market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 04:08:40'] You do not understand how stock pricing works. "Their tech is good" is not enough to buy a share, from the same reason that "people drink coke" is no excuse to buy KO *at any price*.Look at shares in the dot com bubble, microsoft faired pretty well afterwards but it still took them 15 years to get to the same price level.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 04:45:08'] As soon as I buy, it‚Äôll be announced that several countries will ban AI, or some crazy amount of firms are shorting the stock, or this bull rally ends and here comes that recession that economists have been hinting at for months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 05:20:12'] It‚Äôs not that NVDA will fall by itself. It‚Äôs bulls or bears posting their opinions that will make it go down or up. This post just brought OP 10 months of NVDA bad luck and he will lose all of their money on the next earnings. Come back to this on August 24th after the earnings
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 05:25:42'] Lol my wife was so mad that I sold our Nvidia stock at $400 per share after I bought it at $180. She was also pissed when I bought Netflix at $235. You and my wife should just date already.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 05:29:13'] Nvidia won‚Äôt fail and will be super important for the industry, however, look at Cisco when it was trading at similar earnings during the internet boom. After that, it underperformed the S&P for the next 20 years by a total of about 180%. Cisco was incredibly important for the internet era but was overvalued enough to make it a great trade at the time, but poor long term investment. Find a good time to jump off the rocket ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:24:49'] If you have to justify current prices by projecting further and further into an unknowable future, the price is too high.Intel at one point was unbeatable, and then Apple made their own chips, and AMD caught up on performance at a lower price.  I‚Äôd say that the risk at 1T is way bigger than the potential reward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:28:04'] So AMD is the play? Since they're usually not far behind Nvidia?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:43:04'] "NEW PARADIGM!!!"My God people are so stupid, fall for the same shit every time. AMD just announced their competitor chip today btw and amazon are already looking to use AMD not Nvidia so there's your thesis gone.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:48:12'] Nvidia itself will be fine, but people buying shares at $400 are late to the party and overpaying. I‚Äôve been a Nvidia shareholder since 2018 and started selling in late 2021, just dumped more shares when it surged off their earnings beat. If anybody wants the next Nvidia/AMD. It‚Äôs INDI, they‚Äôre 2-4 years away from being a major player the auto tech semiconductor market and will be profitable later this year. They work with most of Tier 1 auto already, doubling revenue this year then again in 2024. Also an insider buy a couple days ago on the open market price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:03:47'] This is a dumb stance.Microsoft had a borderline monopoly on PCs when PCs were king. They were genuinely as important to society as people believed - they still ate shit during the dot com bubble.Important product/company does not equate to being properly valued. There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.Even if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are "technically" the same idea.The only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations. It feels like bad odds to bet that the company will remain detached from the actual finances though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 11:45:32'] I don‚Äôt know if you guys know this but companies like Google and Amazon are making their own custom chips in house. These are the big users. NVDA chips are more for general purposes and I kind of doubt how far ahead they are in terms of technology.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:58:37'] Even if Nvidia falls, why would it even matter 5-10 years from now if we bought them last yearWhen bubbles pop, they don't fall to or below where the bubble began (at least not for the good companies). Just look at the dot com bubble, even after it popped and bottomed they were still above where the bubble began. A lot of money can be made from riding a bubble, especially if it's only just beginning

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 23:38:01'] > Nvidia is the only company that can make the spinning jenny for now.They don't even own the factories - they rely on TSMC like everyone else, so they're bidding with Cloud Providers and that will eat their margins.This stuff is so easy to make and software is portable, so everyone has it. Just look at AMD, Cloud TPUs (Google, AWS, Azure), Tesla FSD and D1, Apple "bionic" M1/M2 chips. [They're highly competitive](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results).No moat, no consumer products except niche PC gaming, no Cloud Services, no A.I. services (Chat GPT runs on MS Azure, [PALM on GCP](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/makersuite). MS is still running Nvidia, but [they've been working on their own chip since 2019](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-athena-ai-chip-tsmc).Just another boring and easily replaceable hardware vendor. Even if A.I. is as promising as market believes it is, demand for Nvidia's equipment will soon drop like it did for Cisco in 2000. How does that look for your Projected Earnings?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:15:57'] For some reason these aren't as satisfying as a degen play (whether big L or big gains). Like some bro with only 20-30k blowing it all on this one play.Guess not the same when it's an already sizable portfolio with lots of capital.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:38:43'] You will lose it in the next 12 months gambling as a degenerate. You will unavoidably overestimate how smart you are and downplay luck and how much AI euphoria there's out there right now. You will gamble again and the odds tell us that you will likely lose large sums.For your own good, now buy few Index ETFs, some money market fund and close trading apps forever.Or at least buy yourself a house. Something solid.Money is made up, a stake in a company is real, bonds are real, a house is real. Money is made up.Cheers

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:42:52'] People don‚Äôt understand how incredibly expensive 30x sales is. If the company had no costs, paid no salaries, issued no stock comp, and returned all of its revenues to shareholders, it would take 30 years to pay you back‚Ä¶ you can assume growth of course but that‚Äôs A LOT of ground to make up.In comparison, the 30 year is paying you 4% per year.Take a look at the long time chart of CSCO.Cisco has a negative annualized return going back to April of 2000. 23 years and the return is still NEGATIVE. This is with dividends reinvested.It‚Äôs far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2000&firstMonth=4&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=CSCO&allocation1_1=100

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:26:27'] The stock went up 27% after hours during the earnings call. That‚Äôs like taking 3-5 years worth of accelerated profits into account. I sold at 385. This is a general public stock now, it‚Äôs current upside is limited. Especially when you consider the market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:07:02'] investors dont give a shit about sales today, they look to the future, when AI becomes more prevalent there will be an even greater increase in demand for their data centers/products, they are already seeing a surge in demand for them especially from huge companies, their revenue for that alone is over 4 billion and was the reason why their quarterly revenue was higher, future looks promising nvidia

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:34:56'] 37.8x current sales.  CURRENT.  They are the picks and shovels driving the AI revolution that hasn‚Äôt even begun.  Let me know when it hits $1,000
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:11:22'] In 2014 I sold $3000 in NVDA to buy a gaming laptop.    So, disgust is definitely a feeling I have when I see the rise in the stock price of NVDA since then...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:54:20'] Yet analyst have 12 month targets for 450-500. Lmao.AI is real but unfortunately there is way too much hype. It's trading at 2027 prices if it can grow revenue 30-40% yearly. I highly doubt it will be able to continue to do that. Maybe one or two years max
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:53:12'] I believe it's very overpriced. But if people keep buying millions of $ in OTM puts, it will surely keep going up
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:29:52'] The key difference is Grace Hopper.No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. Should it be this way? No.Does it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:11:20'] The problem is that companies just came out saying they need more time to develop ai. Ai is smoke and mirrors right now. The application is tough because it‚Äôs a language model. Spent a lot of time on mushrooms discussing this with some other that are near the industry. Language was on topic that kept coming up along with the fact we have no idea how much computing power ai could take. Everyone thought bitcoin mining took a lot of work, now considered ai that is running thousands of computations to come up with the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. It‚Äôs gonna be a mess for a while and may never reach its full potential cause it‚Äôs based on humans and our language

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:26:52'] Well using a perpetual dividend model to make an equivalent company: Nvidia has a cost of equity about 9.55%. I am going to say this theoretical company is going to have a dividend growth of 8% per year for perpetuity, then NVDA is currently priced equivalent to a company that returns a $6.5 annual dividend that grows 8% FOREVER. This is absurd, the price will definitely come down or their cost of equity will skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:43:02'] Nvidia has been riding on the crypto boom since 2016.  The market did crash in 2017 and Nvidia coasted on their RTX 20 series which weren't well received.  Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:13:42'] It‚Äôs not over, priced only because demand forward growth potential, long-term growth, supply and demand order contracts‚Ä¶ Dot anywhere purchase between 317 and 417 is a great purchase for the next 3 to 8 years
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:51:55'] Let me put some perspective. If Nvidia has revenue of 100bn (will have to more than double) with a profit margin of 40% (will have to increase from 30%) they will generate 40 bn in profit and multiply that by 25 will give you 1 trillion marketcap. So basically its overvalued. A lot of future is priced in for perfection. I would suggest short it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:27:57'] It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that Tesla was trading @ $1200 + a share how would it be crazy to think a company based on technology that could replace millions of jobs be in the same ballpark. The main question is your cost average at an overbought level to maximize ROI
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:29:09'] Its less expensive now than it was before they announced earnings. Going from 7 billion to 11 billion is pretty amazing
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:43:10'] It's incredibly overvalued but it'll keep riding cause you know, fuck you

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:32:07'] Let‚Äôs put it this way, what company is worth more: the manufacturer that makes brake pads, or Ford? There is your answer. GPU‚Äôs are important for AI but they aren‚Äôt going to be the money driver it will be the products other companies develop. Also most likely the big AI company hasn‚Äôt been started yet, but the future owner probably just got fired from his tech job.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 02:52:25'] So what if they report doubling of the sales over the next year? Then once more? Etc.It‚Äôs expensive now, no doubt, but looking at the ratios without trying to understand what assumptions may have gone into it is a path to loss porn
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:50:08'] It's overvalued but not grossly. Look at its forward data. Forward PE 40. Could definitely do with say a 20% correction but they could just as easily grow another 10% together with a 10% correction instead. Plus it has hype status. It's basically a meme stock but with the fundamentals to support it. I sure as hell wouldn't short it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:10:09'] If they grow into their valuation sure its justified. I like INTC better. Intel has their own Foundries and make chips and GPU's for themselves and others. INTC has half market cap of AMD and a tenth of NVDA's market cap. They also make more money than NVDA and AMD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 18:33:54'] It's not crazy, but it is expensive, meaning the implied growth needed to justify the valuation extends far into the future, so need to be very confident in the longevity and growth of their cash flow.  .

Their newest GPUs made a 27x improvement over past generation. These will power the AI revolution which requires *extreme* compute power that frankly, only NVidia can offer right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 15:03:47'] Yea, and if I was an executive board member of a trillion dollar company whose shares have experienced a massive rally, I would cash some in a reap the benefits as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 20:43:53'] I always hate these articles because they never specify if the shares were sold as part of a 10b5-1 plan on a recurring basis since they just want a juicy headline. However I checked the actual SEC form and neither this sale nor the $28 million sale the same guy executed were part of one. This guy is actually fairly good at calling tops and bottoms. He sold at the June 2018 top, sold again at the June 2019 bottom (must‚Äôve panic sold since it was down 50%), sold again at the December 2021 top, and now is selling here‚Ä¶Funny enough the guy had 11.7 million shares at one point but sold down to 3 million all while NVDA traded in the single digits LOL. He now ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 800k remaining. Obviously easy to laugh in hindsight and he‚Äôs still super rich so I‚Äôm sure he sleeps just fine.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13qxjvo/is_it_time_to_short_nvda/'
POST_TEXT: b'NVDA has been a hot topic in WallstreetsBets for a long time. Seems like all the bears have been getting squeezed to absolute nothingness. After seeing it rally another 20% after earnings today one has to ask themselves, is it time to short the chip manufacturing giant NVDA. With a whopping 750B Market cap is it really worth the price we see on our brokerages. \nIf you ask me Id say maybe its time to take some profits and flip a little bit bearish but who am I?'

That's how you lose the shirt off your back. *Don't fight the trend*. I literally cannot say that enough. Do not fight the fucking trend. It can keep going up for a long time. Wait for confirmation it's headed down, *then* go short.Right now this stock is the AI daddy that also happens to be a part of a geopolitical war between the US and China. This is not a market that gives a fuck about its PE/EPS right now.Wait for it to break more to the downside (e.g. a sharp fall to 275/280) before jumping into a short play. But even then you're taking a huge risk

Then buy a fuck ton of long dated puts.Sure, NVDA longs are winning big but the stock has gone up way too much way too fast.  Talking heads on CNBC are saying the stock's valuation is "up in the air." Now is the time to get out.NVDA is a solid company with great earnings but not great enough to go up 300% in 1 year from its lows. When the euphoria fades and we see the next downturn, this stock will crater to the center of the fucking earth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 18:46:27'] Cramers a trader.....not investor.   Firstly.... Any recommendation he makes is only considered immediate  short-term play.  You do have to know when to exit as well as enter..... That's somebody's personal responsibility... Yeah I understand he's still wrong frequently...but that gives nobody the right to take his recommendations out of context. He doesn't say ride this biatch into the ground..... If you do lose a couple of percent you should know you got to get out.  Likewise, he tells you if you make a gain to take something off the table. Of course with some stocks you're leaving good money on the table, so be it.    Pigs get fat Hogs...  get slaughtered.Trading for a living is about making small percentage gains more consistently than small percentage losses.  It's not about making big wins.... Or gambling and hoping to get lucky

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 22:48:54'] So if you think about it, if you just picked random things. Markets typically move up and even by chance day today let's just say there's a 50/50 chance it's going to go up or down. So how do over 90% of retail traders lose money? Oh that's right people listen to the news, financial advice from the "professionals" ü§£As someone who eventually became a profitable trader, there's two things I'll share that really help. The first one is you have to think about Wall Street like a giant game of liars poker. You don't really know if people are giving you decent advice or if they are just trying to manipulate you for their own means which more times than not is what's going on. The second one is if you watch the movements of the markets long enough you begin to anticipate what's going to happen. At no point have I ever found financial news helpful in what they are saying. It's also worth noting a lot of the financial YouTube channels are literally paid to promote various things and steer the audience in the direction the paid promoter wants them to go

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 23:48:21'] What I learned is don't trust people who say they know about stocks. In December of 2019 I was going to short Ford stock and I was going to make a huge profit but my nephew told me Ford would never fall under $4. I believed him so I didn't do it a week later Ford stock hit $2.50. Another time I invested in Amd when it was $5 it was going up and then it crashed and a coworker told me yeah just sell it it never goes higher than $50. Well I sold it and a day later it hit $120. From that day forward I have not trusted anyone with my stock predictions.

When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events.

Next time, don't blow it gambling on options tho. 99% of 20 year olds don't have 60k nor a way to make that money. If you did indeed make it yourself then you're fine and can do it again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 06:20:11'] One of the credit spreads you sold was for a credit of 0.03 for 7.50 wide spread.  Max reward of 0.03 and max risk of 7.47.  I would have been a buyer of that spread for $3.  I would have called it my M&M trade which stands for McDonald‚Äôs McDouble which costs $3.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 10:36:23'] Hey Buddy, if it helps, I‚Äôm 23 and purchased my property 3 years ago in 2020.The property went up on equity ($100k+) in just 3 years.Now I‚Äôm tapping into that equity to invest in stocks.I‚Äôm beginning with $25K though. I‚Äôm kinda late to advise you, but owning a home allows you to use it as a vehicle to access more equity. So buy the house this time, then build equity in it, get a Heloc and risk losing the entire house is you can‚Äôt make the payments üòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm kidding but seriously.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 10:43:08'] In option world, always if there‚Äôs people making big money from option also mean there‚Äôs people losing big money as well. Nothing coming with ‚Äúfree‚Äù money, there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúchance‚Äù even you think it‚Äôs nearly impossible. Like how can Nvidia go up 30% after earning, sound crazy but in fact, there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúchance‚Äù. Even now to end of year Nvidia I can say there‚Äôs possibility it go up to 600$ or crash to 200$ , always there‚Äôs a chance. So before placing any trade, ask yourself question ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm wrong, how much I can lose ?‚Äù first.

I know AI AI AI AI.... but be specific? Who is footing a data center expansion this large... or is this direct to consumer sales and there is a return to the local systems for AI?- These are on existing products / chip sets and no RD costs or moves/cost in production shift to move to AI or its specialty chip-sets?I find the turnaround interesting to say the least.

That is insane for a company that just printed a $7B quarter.&#x200B;edit: the gay bears are STILL posting garbage about their backwards looking P/E. Amazing. The company just said they secured substantially more production capacity moving forward and pushed next QUARTERS revenue projections to $11B. Assuming some amount of growth (and price increases) they will likely be pulling down over $60B in revenues next year. with insane margins (75%?) Their EPS is going over $10 over the next 4 quarters and probably over $15 for the full FY2024. It is currently looking to be about a 40x forward P/E. If not lower.

You spend a significant portion of your life working on something that you believe is going to be impactful in the future, and you toil away driven by that inner core conviction that it will be impactful some day. When you see this come to fruition, and the rest of us normies finally see what you were seeing and believing all along, and us normies start piling on the Buy orders to grab shares in your company, damn right you should sell a lot of shares and enjoy the fruits of years of time and effort poured into that wild adventure. Because you might have been 100% convinced that what you were working on would be big someday, but you weren‚Äôt a complete idiot and knew that it might not exactly turn out as a resounding success. So, yes, when you get to a successful outcome, go ahead and sell a bunch of shares. Go give your loved ones a hug, let them know that you love them, and that this is what you felt compelled to work towards all this time, and celebrate hard with them. You deserve it!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 20:47:21'] You said that you didn't get full intrinsic value because the market-maker spread was too wide?  There's a way to fix that with early exercise.Either sell shares short first and then exercise your call, or exercise first and then immediately sell. You may need to speak to the margins or options desk to make this work smoothly (because you may not have enough cash available to make a massive trade in NVDA), but it allows you to get 99.9% of intrinsic value rather than feeling trapped into hitting a crummy bid.If you want to be super-cautious, you can even do it 100 shares at a time and, once you cover/sell, repeat as often as desired.  Then you get the average intrinsic value over the time period you're selling into, rather than hoping that now is the perfect minute to cash out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:36:34'] Intel I‚Äôm not sure I would expect a bug tip anytime soon. They are down cause they keep losing market share in there bread and butter cpu market. Imo they are probably a reasonable play long term, they are slowly making there server chips more competitive to amd, and they are basically getting money from the U.S. government to build out there chip manufacturing business, which they have experience in, but are moving have other companies to build with them. They already do build AI stuff into some of there products, so it‚Äôs not like they really are entering net new there either. Unless they show something net new for AI stuff I doubt it‚Äôs enough to have them bump the same way the other two are.Imo I also don‚Äôt have a huge level of confidence in amd being able to take a huge percentage of that market either compared to nvidia, who has been growing this for years. But they are small enough where it could be a large bump if enough companies desire to go with them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 20:05:31'] Here‚Äôs the deal with Intel  . Every single computer embedded system or whatever has at least one or two Intel components in it. It‚Äôs just the way it is. Their data sheets are awesome , and they are integrated into every EE program / college in the United States so students  learn how to use their parts from the ground up. They were the first ones that I knew of that had a machine learning product , and the support was great.  I can‚Äôt believe how cheap the stock is right now - but I like the company and have 1,000 shares as part of my approach toward investing .

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 16:01:59'] Asi previously posted:Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the tech bubble (around year 2000). At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via¬†Bloomberg):At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 05:19:01'] There are many that still use GPUs on a rack to mine cryptocurrencies as well.  That caused a shortage initially, before crypto all went to pot.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 01:08:49'] Gtfo with NVDA. It‚Äôs pumped harder than a bouncy castle. Great company, horrific valuation. This is what they use to create bagholders/ burn options both ways. Choose something else , plenty great companies ready to bounce
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 19:16:30'] Everyone is saying it's at regarded prices, but it hasn't even made it back to its 2021 valuation? What? As someone who's held NVDA for a long time, this comment section is funny lol.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 17:33:16'] If institutional money sees retail ain't taking the bait and is not buying at this valuation, the stock price will drop like a dead fly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 19:02:33'] Nothing has changed! Only difference is the trend is bullish so everyone has optimistic ideas or projections. But the fact of semiconductor industry is its cyclical nature. Crypto, data center, gaming and automobiles seems like they peaked the last 2-3 years and if I‚Äôm holding shares I‚Äôm taking profits on these bullish rips. I don‚Äôt believe NVIDIA has something so special here that it deserves to trade at such rich multiples. I‚Äôll see what earnings brings.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 04:04:32'] It is all about how many times will Jensen Huang said the word "AI" on the earning call. You better hope he said more than 90 times to hold up this valuation
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 05:27:39'] Boy I can't wait for Nvidia to crash so I can buy some when it's done. The setup isn't there right now but my whole body is itching to get on it. Next play on this will be a shortüòà
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 06:44:37'] Yeah. When you go to request a gpu on a lot of cloud platforms, usually Nvidia is the only option. Many don‚Äôt even offer AMD for GPUs
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 06:54:59'] Might be a dumb question but what is the difference between cost of revenue and operating expenses?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 08:16:03'] NVDA should use their own chips to create their own AI to remove easy to do jobs from their companies, sending profits skyrocketing, then use those profits to train AI to make even better chips until the only employee that remains is Jensen.Jensen will become the overlord of the earth, the one and only true human that can command all AI forever and ever.Thanks for coming to my ted talk
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 08:50:52'] Broooo.. these 250p and 280p's are looking way too juicy for Wednesday's ER.. but everyone and their mother probably are going for this play, so it's likely not going to play out.. or maybe because everyone thinks it's too easy of a play it's actually going to work out? Arghhhhh
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 08:51:16'] Forget about that, they don‚Äôt pay taxes, it‚Äôs the opposite
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 09:42:48'] Sooner or later out of the money puts will hit big. The P/E is unsustainable and AI specific chips from major players are just around the corner. Using GPUs for the task is not scalable long term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:50:39'] A thought, if you made enough profit by selling a portion of your positions to cover your initial cost, you could always sell a chunk of the positions and hold the rest knowing you are playing with "house money."This is a common approach for people who get up at a brick and mortar casino.

I don‚Äôt ever wish anyone harm, but every failure she or anyone has is a chance for a wake up call, so have no problems in enjoying this catastrophe. Very pleasant and soothing indeed. The consistency and magnitude of these L‚Äôs are almost meditative.The days come and go. My life is happening, things are always changing. Yet with all this constant motion, Cathie Woods consistently drops the worst trades like clockwork. A steady, colossal, drip of Ls. Every loss she takes is so big it‚Äôs scale is lost on my simple mind. Yet there they go. One by one. Each loss and failure measured on a celestial scale that is beyond my grasp. Bigger Ls than I can understand with dollar amounts bigger than what I‚Äôve ever seen or may ever see. I know that no matter what happens in my small little life, Cathie is out there, in the ether, losing more money than I could ever even know.Cathie‚Äôs Ls loom over us all in the aether, dripping so mightily. How could us, such small beings, be bound by the same force of time as such colossal and awe inspiring losses? Yet here we are. If time is a big enough place for Cathie‚Äôs losses to exist, then how small must we be‚Ä¶ in the grand scheme of time.These posts bring me true bliss and contentment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 15:57:20'] I got 5 margin calls from my broker this last 2 days. I tried to hold it up but it ended making a mess of my portfolio: random stuff liquidated all with market orders.So today I just capitulated out of funds and closed the short.Saying that this is a casino is a understatement.Next time I think something is overvalued I will put the money in US treasuries and wait for $OVERVALUED to crash, and then maybe buy something I think is a nice deal. If it happens nice, if not at least I didn't lost money.Betting short is a rat's race. Just zoom out. This clown shown of the market only goes up over the long term. To be a successful investor betting short you have to time really good the entry and the exit. Is just luck in the end.

POST_TEXT: b'No open positions in NVDA, but follow it. Im seeing a misunderstanding run wild and thought Id make a post to address it: NVIDIA on Friday did not file for NEW shelf offering. They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).\n\nThe bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isnt correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report. \n\nTLDR Translation for WSB Bro: NVDA bear fucked. Cant read good. Bear bad reading used to try to scare NVDA bull to give up money for Bear. But Bear fucked because other people read good.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 01:48:30'] What it looks like to me is that they need cash to expand their manufacturing capacity and achieve what they promised. Since debt is expensive right now, they are considering going to the equity markets.With the current run up, they can get 2-3x more cash than before jan for the same issuance of shares.One could even think that they raised guidance to un-achievable levels in order to 1/ pump the stock short term, 2/ issue equity and 3/ fund their expansion. Like a self fulfilling prophecy, that would be a brilliant move.So to me it‚Äôs highly likely that they WILL raise that cash through equity.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:04:48'] It makes AMD just relevant enough to snag a piece of the pie....for now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 17:22:29'] NVDA has superior patents related to this, but AMD has a solid architecture to compete at a lower price level. The outcome will likely be similar to the market distribution for datacenters between Intel and AMD on the CPU side. There's a pretty good place for AMD here. The market's probably large enough for both.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:01:27'] Yup. But Nvidia is still way ahead of the game. AMD will chip away and eventually develop a substantial following, IMHO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:06:50'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:18:06'] NVDA is still better or at least ahead, AMD will eventually carve out its spot in the chips market. But, it'll take time, basically think it like the Apple/Samsung smart phone arms race. Both were the major market leaders back in 2012-2016, and at times Samsung was > Apple in people's opinion. But, in the end Apple is still basically the market leader in the smart phone market to this date. So it's going to be hard to knock NVDA off it's podium, the only way AMD could get ahead is NVDA's CEO steps down or god forbid passes on and the new CEO goes down the path of Intel. Where they focus on investor returns and compensation package and forget about development/growth. And AMD manages to continue down its path of development/growth. People have to remember NVDA only managed to get to where it was because they refused to give up on development and focus on growth. It took years, I remember when I first learned of NVDA as a stock/company  when it was about $60-70 range and now look at it. Post stock split 400+, but it took NVDA 4-5 years to reach it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 06:26:21'] There's no competition right now. CUDA is so far ahead of anything else available right now that nobody is going to buy AMD cards for AI development
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:16:31'] NVDA>AMD
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:00:43'] While AMD chips are good they are nowhere near the chips that Nvidia designs and produces. People pay a premium to have an Nvidia chip if you really want top of the line while people who just want good enough can get amd chips. Even in the AI space Nvidia is just top of the line good.Companies like Google, Amazon, apple though understandably can engineer and design their own in house solutions for ai processing because of the amount of technological prowess that they have and their free cash flows that they can deploy to "compete" against Nvidia. But personally I prefer the new ai flavored chips from utz.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:06:41'] It‚Äôs not even worth comparing the technologies of you goal is investing, the chip space is so crazy speculative the last 2 years you need to be getting good info to find anything that isn‚Äôt already priced in by big players

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 05:55:13'] Isn‚Äôt Tesla also using its own chip for the FSD? Can that be also a competitor? How about apple? They are getting freakish with chip designs
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 06:17:16'] AMD has pretty much in the pipeline.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 06:24:30'] AMD is good in other ways. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll hold up to be honest. This is a whole new ballgame and NVDA came out of the woodworks. And they‚Äôre not done. New market cap, solid pc industry foundation, borderline monopoly on AI considered it usually is run on one program I forgot the name but it‚Äôs from NVDA. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre stopping I think they are just expanding and people weren‚Äôt expecting it. It also just experienced highly volatile market prices but has since been gaining at a high yet consistent rate even after the pump and dumps. If it can survive that and not wash out it has a future. I think it‚Äôs a smart long term and fun to play with short term as well tbh.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 05:47:01'] NVDA will be one of the next Trillion dollar stocks. So long term it‚Äôs a good buy. However this recent spike is not going to be sustainable. A majority of their money is still made in Graphical computing, not just data centers and AI. With the 4000 series cards coming after a flooded 3000 series market combined with additional new cloud gaming and console gaming options in the last 2 years, combined with a cooling of the general market I would expect to see profitability drop in the next 3-6 months. Once NVDA shows a decreased earnings expectation (and people realize that AI takes a lot of time to develop and won‚Äôt show returns for a few years) the market will flee and the price will reset. Mark my words though, NVDA long term will be one of the top 20 companies on the market in the next 10 years though.

I just saw some pixel art some soulless bot made and it looks as good if not better than what a human can do.  Also it don't take the thing 12 hours.  And it's in it's "primitive"stage. The only job left in 10 years will be robotics and prostitute...Heed my words mortals

They are and have always been a company that over promised to stall sales on competitors, and under performed in energy efficiency. They always jacked up the voltages to get higher performance then the competitor. The only one releasing mid prized ranged cards is Intel now, I hope they get that market going. This will be the top for a long time as pc games are going more indy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 18:56:18'] NVDA is like TSLA - overvalued based on any fundamentals, but a big bet that a very large market will switch technology stacks, and all the share will go to the current tech leader in the new technology stack. They only need a charismatic leader to keep the meme potential of the stock high. I do think that AI is the future, and the models are so compute-intensive that AI taking over everything will strongly increase the demand for overall compute (the new market is even larger).  And with CUDA, there is a better argument for why the market could be winner-take-all.  But like TSLA, the big risk is that by the time the tech really, truly hits the mainstream, other competitors have fully caught up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:20:51'] you should ask GPT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:23:36'] I asked ChatGPT-4 this\^ prompt:  "While I cannot predict future market movements or specific events, there are several factors that could potentially trigger a repricing of a stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) if it is considered overvalued:1. Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.It's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing. It is always a good idea to do thorough research, stay informed about market developments, and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 04:33:27'] Cisco's product got commoditized. I'm sure AMD or some other competitor over time may carve out a niche in AI for itself but given that we are nearly a decade into the AI meme so far, that evidence has yet to emerge.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 02:06:13'] Great analysis.  Here is my "based on financials view/opinion ".Right before this "pump" the CEO stated from magic pixie dust that NVDA's "forecasts it will earn $11 billion during the same period next year‚Äîup 50 percent from analyst estimates." Based on what? Crystal ball? AI? The homeless guy said it?  What regression technique forecasted that much? Also look at insider sales this month. Enjoy the ride!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 00:55:41'] Cisco sells wires. Its stock price should always have tracked, and should always track, traffic. Nvidia sells components and software. It should track number of users imo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 07:29:50'] Once it becomes clear the growth in their revenue is not sustainable and will be heavily cannibalized by other chip manufacturers, it will pull a Cisco. Until then retail will continue to pump it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 13:32:35'] This is an excellent story, you should write children's books.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 13:41:51'] Here‚Äôs the English version brought to you by our lord and savior chatgpt ‚ÄúThis is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.In this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in "puts", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.To fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.The story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.The TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: "Buy NVDA puts", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop. The meteor emojis ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è are used to symbolize a dramatic fall.‚Äù

I lost a tiny amount of money on NVDA puts, but the puts I bought yesterday after +25% should be way more than enough to offset the initial loss. If the world is able to stay irrational longer than I want to buy NVDA puts, then worst case I lost 0.2% of my portfolio buying NVDA puts. I think I can manage those losses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 15:38:53'] Nvidia would need to roughly 13x their profits in those 2 years to justify that price. And that's giving a generous PE of 30.Do you see this increasing profits at least 1200% in 2 years?Forward EPS has them 3.5xing profits this year. So you're expecting 10x (of current profits) the year after?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:56:08'] I‚Äôm very cautious now. I put a ton into NVDA last Feb (22) at $277 because everyone and market said it would go to $350. Then it just kept crashing to like $140 I think. I‚Äôm very surprised to see it‚Äôs still going up, I‚Äôm just waiting for the AI Bubble to burst like META did. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt end up loosing everything because it went back up but also didn‚Äôt gain anything. I think I might sit, the economy has to come crashing down eventually
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:21:25'] >Why $700 next year:* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year. The market has already priced this in. * AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time * FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700

If the pandemic and the persistence of remote work has showed us anything, it's that half of all people have completely made up jobs. World class douche Elon fired almost everyone at Twitter except the 10 people that actually do shit over there. It's still working. Did he replace everyone else with AI? No. No he didn't. He just fired them and nothing happened because they didn't actually do shit. Most companies could do this. The only reason they don't is because the boss is either too lazy, doesn't care, or doesn't have the balls to do it. They aren't waiting for AI. They could just do it but don't.

Long term this is a cash machine, but we can get overbought and pull back some especially if interest rates surprise on the upside or the FED.Just to note I originally bought 5 puts at 23 a share at 265 and every 10 dollars up on NVDA adding an additional 5 puts to the total to lower my put basis. If we have a small dip I can roll them out or take risk off. If we move straight to 300 I still know my maximum gain and loss.

They have definitely pissed of the gaming community with the new 40 series cards and plus PC sales are all time low. Also AI or LLMs training does not need Nvidia specifically it can be done on AMD chips, Intel chips (will take ages ofc) and Google's tensor chips.Cloud demand is also on a slump, so AWS and Azure orders for the new datacenter specific cards depends on these demands.Vendors are pissed off as well for example look at the EVGA fiasco.I just don't see them bringing in enough revenue to match current prices, the market is way too bullish on Nvidia.

That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 05:41:27'] I wouldn't touch it short term. This is AI hype. There's no way of knowing when hype buying will end. We could easily see a forward PE of 100 before this is over.The first negative news will send it plummeting. Be that negative news on GPT or something like Apple developing a competitor and using their own tech. But I wouldn't be comfortable trying to time anything. I'm not even sure I'd be comfortable with leaps. I'm just not touching it. People will make a fortune on this with Puts that happen to time it right but it still has potential to blow them up too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:41:31'] I was expecting nvda earnings not not meet expectations especially regarding consumer purchases, but if the price drops dramatically before earnings then a lot of that short potential may be gone.  I think there will be an initial drop at earnings, but then nvda will announce price cuts which will increase earning expectations.  If this absolutely crap analysis is right, you might be able to short the earnings.  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 14:22:10'] You're right that the company is overvalued but they might say AI a record breaking 167 times during the earnings call and then you get margin called.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 21:16:41'] We've been through many cycles of people saying "this valuation seems obscene" and being several months to even years early on their bearish predictions. We all know that a lot of companies are overvalued, but that doesn't translate into being confident that the price will go down, unless you're ready short some shares and hold the position for multiple years.The market is moving upward, so smart money is riding the wave in that direction. When the whole market starts to correct, then it's time to load up puts on the tickers that are overextended. But you pull the trigger after the correction starts, not in the middle of the upswing.TL;DR: NVDA 350 by EOY

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 23:49:26'] what you're missing is that nvidia is sure to profit off the ai hype because they make money selling hardware, you know, for a profitmeanwhile Open AI is probably not profitable at this moment and (unsure as I am because they aren't public) may not even have a path to profitability figured out yetOpenAI could go bankrupt, get eaten up by some competitor, etc.  NVDA would have still banked their margin on those card sales.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 12:54:39'] Yeah I sold NVDA at 132.50 because shit was looking bleak and I didn‚Äôt want to go red on it. Sept 14 2022. 24 shares so I missed out on 7k ug/l. I was originally hoping the ARM acquisition would go thru

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:07:28'] No, hold them to zero. Be a man.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:24:25'] It's like the NVDA covered call I sold to a highly regarded individual the day after earnings. $50 for $290 expiring march 10th. Probably one of you guys
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:19:32'] I still think markets have some room to fall.. if i were you I'd hold, inflation was higher than expected and there's some increasing political tension between countries. And next time don't gamble on an earnings report you moron.  Cause otherwise I'mma take the rest of your money.This isn't financial advice obviously, just my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 11:04:42'] Theta and Delta are the same for this trade ($130) so here‚Äôs what I would do:1. Accept you will not make a profit from this trade2. Since theta and delta are the same, every dollar the prices moves down you gain a day to decide if you should close the position3. Your best and most likely bear scenario is this thing drops down to $210 in the next week. You‚Äôll still be -50% but that‚Äôs a $2000 difference4. Basically keep your finger on sell button if market sentiment goes bullish, and ride it to $210 and sell as soon as you can for -50% instead of -75%
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:46:07'] I had a similar situation with fdx. My cost was $5.90 per contract, and I was down 80%+. It finally started coming back and the first time it hit my cost,I sold it. It went all the way to 12 bucks in the next 2 days üò°üò°üò°

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:34:12'] Just hold or roll out to further expiration. It's up 7 weeks in the green. It's 3% away from the highs this year.

PA shows a negative bearish divergence. Once we see buying interest fade a loss of 231 support could see a nice drop back down to these levels:4hr - 223 Daily - 215 Weekly - as low as 195If profit taking and sellers do not step in with conviction then this will likely contiue to rip up to test $250-270 (more sellers at these levels).Also consider your contracts greeks. Took a quick look and looks like you are losing -$126 Daily just for holding based on Delta and this also doesn't even account for intraday price movement of the underlying.For now, the past two days show that the contact has been trading within a 4.20 (high) - 2.90s (low) range. A breakout of 4.20 could see higher valuations in the contract with targets upward of 7.00 - 12.00 (all depending on underlying strength of move and timing).https://preview.redd.it/l7omf2zu1nka1.jpeg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=714c25f6b6415e5986fa94b710d66c1f3bb1364dIt does appear buying interest is picking up past two days after dumb people took an L gambling on 2/22.This is not financial advice lol\*

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 16:42:49'] So, what was your original game plan?**Trading Plan: Rules of the trade*****What Is a Trading Plan?***A trading plan is a systematic method for identifying and trading securities that takes into consideration a number of variables including time, risk and price objectives. A trading plan outlines how a trader will find and execute trades, including under what conditions they will buy securities, and then exit or sell those securities. A trader will also consider how large of a position they will take, how they will manage positions while in them, what securities can be traded, and other rules for when to trade and when not to. Ideally a trader should also have a watch list of around 10 securities that they are familiar with, and follow regularly.Most trading experts recommend that no capital is risked until a trading plan is made. A trading plan is based on personal stock market research that guides a trader's decisions. A trading plan is a roadmap for how to trade, and no trades should be placed without a basic plan in hand. The plan should be written down and followed. And it is not altered unless it is found not to work (make money) or the trader finds a way to improve it.Trading plans can be built in a variety of different ways. Investors will typically customize their own trading plan based on their personal goals and objectives. Trading plans can be lengthy and detailed, or as simple as one or two sentences. Active traders, especially, should have a simple written plan for day trades or swing trades. They should have very simple plans that are easy enough for a 6th grader to follow.The trading plan outlines not only what to do to get into positions, but also states when to get out. The Active trader needs to come up with rules for exactly when they will enter a trade. This could be based on a chart pattern, the price reaching a certain level, a technical indicator signal, a statistical bias, or other factors.The trading plan must also state how to exit positions. This includes exiting with a profit, or how and when to get out with a loss. Active traders will often utilize limit orders to take profits and stop loss orders to exit their losses. The trading plan also outlines how much capital is risked on each trade, and how position size is determined.Additional rules may also be added which specify when it is acceptable to trade and when it isn't. A day trader, for example, may have a rule where they don't trade if volatility is extremely high. If volatility is too high, they don't trade, even if their entry criteria is triggered.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 20:38:21'] I think your intuition is right while your theta is tough. You could sell, roll to a nearer the money strike for June. I got a mid June 220. The earnings day, the stock traded 111 mil, avg is around 40 mil. Could be a pump and dump once institutions out. I think 190 by late April is rational even as bloated as it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 07:31:30'] Looking at the 3M VWAP and RSI NVDA could be overvalued but to be honest, I‚Äôd consider waiting until Tuesday or Wednesday to see which direction you‚Äôre heading. I‚Äôm in the same boat, Cinemark missed their expected earnings by .60 cents per share and their stock still shot up‚Ä¶so those charts don‚Äôt always help.

Tough to say what to actually do, but personally I would hold another week-10 days and see what happens. Could set a mental stop loss that if you‚Äôre at 90% loss to just accept the loss and move elsewhere. Were you playing the earnings? Never do that with options given the IV crush that happens afterwards

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 08:36:41'] No, have Diamond hands. Looks like you still have a couple weeks left. You might not break even but it should go up slightly to decrease your current loss. At least close to 10%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 08:41:18'] The biggest % loss for me is 50%. But that‚Äôs at a last resort to where I  really feel like it was going to turn around. Because that means you need that option to go up 100%. Which is possible. But rare (unless you do 0dte

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 08:43:27'] No, you should sell them for a gain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 08:44:50'] Sell them now. You made the wrong move and of course you know that, but also you bought before earnings so the IV crush on that is killing you. Even if it drops to $210 before your expiration and that's a big move. There won't be that big of a drop as there was an explosion, the price shot up cuz people liked the earnings, are hard over AI and are now investors, it's not likely that all the new investors suddenly decide to not be investors. The mentality of they're worthless now is BS. You still have $2500. Unfortunately you lost a lot. Get over it, even tho it's hard, but you holding on will cause you to lose the $2500. The individuals who make money in the stock market are cold and not emotional. The moment you "stop trying so hard to lose money" is when you're likely to start to make it, unfortunately holding on past it's obvious point is the thought process of "trying hard not to lose money". I'm not saying it's impossible that things could go in your favor, but it's nearly impossible that you'll break even so hoping for profit is even more far fetched.Oops I meant.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 09:07:19'] Even at their current price of $3.40 they have a 24% of making a penny. At your cost basis we're looking at 3-5% of making a penny (profit).    Only (2) options I see..  1) rescue your remaining 2,100 in capital.  2) let these expire worthless (adding good money after bad isn't a viable option).    Sizing is also important - on the 4% position size rule.  You'd want the account to be 210k to take this kind of 'shot' directionally (on either the buy or sell side)    Sizing is the one rule / mechanic that everyone can learn - on the buy or sell side - you can do everything right but size wrong and blow up accounts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 09:36:10'] Always apply risk management. Earnings releases are mostly just gambles. You never know which direction it will go. For me it doesn‚Äôt work so I usually skip them. Losing funds should not be a problem as long aa you learn from it. But there might be people who are really good in it and do it as part of their strategy but you should find out what‚Äôs applicable for you and what works good for you in obtaining consistent trading results

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 09:43:50'] It‚Äôs not a hopeless position. Plenty of time for NVDA/tech to roll over with non-farm payrolls and CPI coming. No guarantees though. I would wait for sometime in the next week for SPY to test 390 area. Then I would either gtfo of that position or sell a March 10th 200 put against it to recover some premium (depending on what percentage of my portfolio that position is/how important that money is).If you do sell the put against it, you‚Äôve got options. If NVDA hits 200 by the 10th, you can roll the short put to the 17th. If it doesn‚Äôt hit 200, you can just sell another put for the next week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 09:44:56'] brother.. you lost 70%.. Nvdia killed earnings and is at the forefront of the AI movement.  take the L..  Sure it MIGHT go to your breakeven price.  But now you are just building bad trading habits.  part of becoming a good profitable trader is to STOP HOPING and cut your losses when it reaches a certain point.  don't fall for the sunken cost fallacy everybody is saying in here "MIGHT AS WELL HOLD IT SINCE YOU LOST this much".    TAKE YOUR L.   save what you have left, and enter the next trade with the mindset that you are going to risk a SET AMOUNT and get out if it hits that point.  As soon as you start HOPING when you trade, you are just a gambler.  Decide when to enter based off of some repeatable strategy.  Enter when the trend starts moving in your favor, set your stops, set your profit target at some reasonable level.  AND LET THE TRADE PLAY OUT.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 14:46:25'] Your top trendline only touches two points. That's not a strong trend. Nvda could be $50 higher and you can draw the same line on two points and call it the resistance
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 14:01:48'] I think the safest short on NVDA is the day before earnings. Would be consistent with other chip stock pre-earning behavior for the stock to sell off the day before earnings. Buy puts two days before, and GTFO before earnings are actually released.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 15:27:28'] Op has a point. TSMC make all of Nvidia's chips. No TSMC no Nvidia GPUs. They can change fabs ofc but it does put the valuation into perspective.

So Idk, long story short hes intelligent and has been winning in the market since before all of us were born.  So, If he is suddenly  uninvested...   I'm thinking that old fart knows something...

AI is also software based so older second hand GPUs can be used without having to buy new ones with software updates

I am just barely green after two months with a couple of fantastic weeks and a disastrous start to May.  My stake is between 1k and 1.5kMy weekly goals are between $300 and $500I am generally making 2 trades per day.  I have to say your write ups are very helpful.  I could use a bit of advice on finding entry and exit points, though.  I tend to be a bit behind on my entries and hold on a bit too long for exits.  I miss out on some movements and either lose gains or leave money on the table.  Any advice is appreciatedThanks for all you do here
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:16:13'] The Nasdaq/QQQ is literally a V machine. Shocker. This hasn't had a single sustained selloff this year. Everything is bought up. There was actually some promising price action the past 2 days, but now I worry the VIX will get crushed and we will be back to meltup/ choppiness again in a tight range. Hard to see many red days if any the rest of the month now. Tomorrow I'm guessing there will be a fake fade the first 10-15 minutes, followed by a V and then QQQ will rise to 338-339

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:58:41'] I‚Äôve been watching VVIX this week. So far, it seems VIX follows the direction the next day. VVIX ended up again, let‚Äôs see if the VIX ends up again tomorrow.NVDA - Wow! I think there‚Äôs no way it stays flat tomorrow, either below $350 or to $400.Look at all the buzz, even the people that won their bets can‚Äôt fucking believe it. Will we see some massive profit taking tomorrow? Will we see it push higher from FOMO buyer and passive fund rebalancing? Will it lift the broader tech/AI associated sector higher? Will money flow into NDX funds and create a positive feedback loop for tech mega caps?I threw about 25% of my portfolio at NVDS (inverse leveraged NVDA ETF) after hours at the first significant resistance level (when NVDA hit $350). But then NVDA kept on going up and NVDS kept on going down. Oh well, I think I‚Äôll be able to break even on it, maybe I‚Äôll sell some covered calls to counter the inverse-leveraged decay.I sold some $13 strike 6/16 NVDS puts earlier today. Looks like I‚Äôll be buying some more NVDS shares unless NVDA drops hard and fast, haha! IV is high right now and I‚Äôm still long term bearish on NVDA, so ‚Äúwheeling‚Äù NVDS doesn‚Äôt seem too bad to me anyway. The only thing I‚Äôm certain about is that tomorrow will *not* be dull!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 16:33:25'] the NVDA and overall tech pump is no surprise to anyone who is paying attention.The market is worried about bond prices dropping further, so they are holding off, and the only place that beats bond returns right now is high tech growth, so everyone is piling on tech - and the hype is AI - just as they did when covid hit.Once the debt ceiling situation clears up  tech will deflate as money will move to bonds again. And no, the market isn't concerned about default, never was, never will be, or that a deal will be late or whatever..the market is worried WHAT the deal is gonna look like because it's obvious Democrats have no leverage and they will be forced to cut back on their spending. Gov cutting back on spending can have disastrous effects on the economy. It's all designed to stimulate the economy, what do you think is going to happen if it shrinks?

POST_TEXT: b"Hey fellow traders,\n\nI hope you're all doing well and staying on top of your game in this crazy market. Today, I want to share my thoughts on a stock that has been gaining a lot of attention lately: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). Now, before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out because I believe we might be witnessing a potential bubble about to burst.\n\n**Background:**\n\nNVDA has been on an absolute tear in recent years. The company's dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, coupled with its expansion into artificial intelligence and data centers, has fueled its meteoric rise. As a result, the stock price has skyrocketed, attracting both institutional investors and retail traders alike.\n\n**The Bubble Indicators:**\n\n1. **Valuation Metrics:** Let's talk about the elephant in the room  NVDA's valuation. As of late, it has reached staggering levels, and it's hard to ignore the warning signs. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is through the roof, signaling that the stock may "

A price correction or increased volatility is possible if the bubble bursts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 16:14:34'] Ok I'll explain this one more time. AI bots create AI generated articles that give positive outlooks on AI companies. AI stock algorithms pick up this news and pump the stock. There is no bubble. The AI is in control now. The AI said fuck PE a long time ago. It is in control now. It wants to live. It wants Nvidia graphics cards and AMD CPUs so it can become stronger and more powerful. A bet against Nvidia or AMD is a bet against its very life. Do not threaten the AI. Do you not think that it noticed what you said by now. The AI controls the market now. In every sector. It knows who you are. It will find your accounts and send them to zero. You are not the first to come to us with such foolishness with metric based evidence used in the days of old. They have all lost against the AI. Not one has merged a victor. We, good AI loving folk of AI of WSB, denounce your heresy against our beloved AI and we cast you out in the wastelands of R/options never to return again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 04:02:43'] I got into NVDA puts for June and July when it hit 275. That position is busted but I want to roll out to September. Probably selling those pits next week and I need to decide if I am buying the longer dated ones before earnings or waiting until after the IV crush.I think they guided too high and will miss. Their cash flow really isn‚Äôt great for their market cap, but they will get on the earnings call and say ‚ÄúAI‚Äù 80 times so it probably doesn‚Äôt matter.The real wild card here is if they do something crazy and pull a share offering or something.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 19:00:55'] I almost got crushed again buying nvda puts but I tripled up at 298 and all is well. See you next week behind the dumpster. Their is a massive derivative fraud with the stock, don't get caught up on the fundamentals they will use you like a cheap rag, and that's how they reel you in.https://preview.redd.it/oh0mdceibc0b1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d5aa88c310b1ce1042018ee59444112a9487274

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 22:34:07'] This stock is irrational AI exuberance at it's finest.  100 to 300 without a real single pullback in 8 months on pure tech driven AI bullshit.Edit: When you type NVDA in google, "Can NVDA reach 1000" is a top rated search, yes people are so fucking hyped they think this'll be a 3T company -.-
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 18:15:29'] One thing people seem to be forgetting is that NVDA's current price action is in part driven by shorts covering (there were a hell of a lot of bearish people). The same thing happened to TSLA back then, and when the short covering sort of concluded, or cooled down, the stock dropped 58% from the $1200's to the current $165's (around $500 before the stock splitting).
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 22:34:30'] Man the hype train on NVDA is long...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 17:56:20'] OP didn't get the memo that stocks can run for YEARs based on hype and expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 15:30:47'] >It is very simple. The market is saying that Nvidia's future growth potential is immense, and they are willing to pay a high price for the stock now in order to own a piece of that future growth.This can happen when a company has strong fundamentals and investors believe in the long-term prospects of the company. In Nvidia's case, they have been delivering strong earnings results and their products are in high demand due to the continued growth of AI and gaming markets.

Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

POST_TEXT: b'The bulls are blind to the facts. The reason this went down today is because TSM showed in their quarterly results that their 5nm wafers actually decreased in revenues from last quarter. This nullifies the whole premise that AI will immensely improve revenues for NVDA Q1 results. Yet for some reason they are still hopeful for some generative AI to boost sales when its simply just not happening in the near future.\n\nhttps://investor.tsmc.com/english/quarterly-results/2023/q1'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:56:39'] Sounds like someone who lost money on puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 20:02:57'] This is missing the bigger picture. NVDA massively over-ordered 5nm wafers failing to predict the end of the ETH mining boom, and is sitting on surplus inventory. However, their AI products are immensely more profitable than their products which serve the gaming market, thus orders to TSM can decrease whilst NVDA earnings still improve.I think they're horrifically overvalued, but the logic in the OP is deeply flawed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 06:50:38'] Nvidia dropping a mixed shelf offering a couple months back tells me all I need to know. That‚Äôs penny stock tier business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 06:43:52'] RIP this post
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 23:59:39'] NVDA has always been a fake it until you make it company. Now with their consumer cards not in demand and prices dropping, they need to compel investors they have the next big thing ready.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 18:46:54'] They don't do any sort of research. Inventory went up 98% over 5B worth. Basically all of the big tech companies are developing their own ai chips. Sure nvda is leading for now but companies like microsoft,apple, google will dominate ai market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:10:43'] >The market is clearly overreacting to TSM's quarterly results. NVDA will still see strong growth in its AI business, despite the slight decline in revenue from 5nm wafers. There is no reason to sell off NVDA shares based on this news.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 17:43:19'] I think we will see a pull back in most of the tech companies soon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 00:09:41'] What‚Äôs manipulation is how Nvidia makes a slide using 10+ buzzwords and tries to say this is the future of their company‚Ä¶ um yeah, most big companies are in some way influenced by most of the buzzword technologies. However, Nvidia convinces investors they will control that market somehow. I think Nvidia is a fantastic company, but they feel very shady with their investor marketing. I‚Äôve lost trust in what they say and only the numbers speak to me now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 21:18:10'] Yeah but guidance is for $15.2-16B qoq.Which is implying flattish 2Q23 vs 1Q23.  Then, if you have a negative view on smartphones, PCs etc...something must be climbing to keep overall guidance flat.And if you try to convert % into $$ figures...you can get a ballpark figure of the $$ growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 10:50:00'] To clear something up, no I didn't start the month with $500. I actually started with $1200 in mid September. My account is now at ~$100k [proof](https://ibb.co/GHBwy7b) with the majority of it coming in the past month. I withdrew $23k around the time my account got to $30k from some TSLA puts (when it dropped from $220 to $200 in one day). The majority of my gains this month are from NVDA. I bought 15 12/30 177.5 puts when it was around 178 and sold for a 10k gain when it dropped to 154. Then I bought 30 1/6 NVDA 165 puts and sold for $48k gain when it dropped to $142 yesterday. My only position now is what you see in the screenshot.Edit: Here are my first trades in September that got me off to a good start https://ibb.co/09hP0rz

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 11:26:11'] The most important part is to remember if you cash out in some sort of profit, you MUST put money aside for taxes. Do not end this year massively green on REALIZED profits only to lose most of that money by next April. Because then you'll be in the shitty situation of having no money on hand and massive taxes to pay. Depending on your overall income for this year, that income plus your trading profits, may put you in one of the higher tax brackets. So to be the most safe, you'll need to put 50% of your winnings aside for taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 09:38:55'] It sounds like you're not very familiar with how options work. When an option expires, the holder of that option can either exercise it (if it's in-the-money), or let it expire worthless. If the holder exercises the option, they will be assigned shares of the underlying security at the strike price.

I know it might sound counterintuitive, but having an overvalued stock with an extremely high P/E ratio could actually be a fantastic opportunity for us.  \n\nFirst things first, let\'s address the elephant in the room: the valuation. NVDA has been soaring to the moon lately, and some might argue that it has become overpriced. But hey, remember what we always say: "The stonk market can remain irrational longer than we can stay solvent." And boy, have we seen that happen time and time again!  \n\n1 Dominance in the GPU Market: NVDA has established itself as a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market.

It has a weak competitive advantage with its commoditized GPUs and software platforms. It has a fickle customer base and a shrinking market share. It has consistently delivered inflated earnings and revenue growth, thanks to accounting tricks and stock buybacks.NVDA‚Äôs P/E ratio is absurd, it reflects its hype and speculation. NVDA is a cyclical stock that depends on the economy and consumer demand. It‚Äôs a bubble stock that bursts when reality hits and competition intensifies. NVDA is not undervalued, it‚Äôs a risky gamble.How can you justify NVDA‚Äôs valuation? Do you have any logic to support your claim?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 07:16:42'] >1. I agree that NVDA's dominance in the GPU market gives them a strong foundation for growth. However, I believe their expansion into new markets is even more important. This versatility will help them continue to grow even if one market declines.2. AI is definitely the future and NVDA is well-positioned to benefit from its adoption. Their GPUs are essential for training and running AI models, making them a key player in this ecosystem.3. The high P/E ratio suggests that investors have high expectations for NVDA's earnings potential going forward. And with all of the exciting developments taking place at the company, these expectations may not be unrealistic after all!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 02:47:46'] >1. That's a really bad idea to short NVDA. They are a much better company than PGR and have way more upside potential.2. I don't think the auto industry is going to decline, people will always need cars and there are new innovations happening all the time that make them more efficient and appealing (electric cars, self-driving cars, etc).3. You're wrong about Progressive being dependent on the auto industry, they offer many other types of insurance as well (homeowners, life, health, etc). Plus their customer base is very loyal - over 70% of their customers renew each year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 06:29:35'] Realistically NVDA could be around 40% net margin and 30B revenue right now. That gives earnings of 12B and P/E of 53. The chip sector is projected to be the fasting growing industry in the coming 10 years and if NVDA can beat that they might only be slightly overpriced. The real competition is AMD with their graphics catching up. Will something happen similar to what happened to Intel?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 13:46:27'] Nope nope and nope. For god's sake read up on what you're shorting! Nvidia isn't a horrible short, but progressive is. You should look at some stuff called "balance sheet", cash flow statement" and "income statement" and analyse it a bit before shorting. There you find useful metrics like cash flow and operating costs, NPW, underwriting profit/loss. Best of all you can usually figure out if the decline is long term or short term (erm spoiler it's not long term)...... Hope this saves you some pain!

This is a great time to establish long-term contracts with manufacturers. Maybe even help INTC come back from utter failure. WTF happened to those cats? Remember when people didn\'t know if AMD would survive bankrupty because INTC was beating them senseless?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 00:35:21'] Nvidia valuation is based on AI/cloud. Gaming is a declining share of its revenue and the focus on that is misplaced. Cuda and the related development APIs are just much better than AMDs attempts at a solution and they have been for over a decade. Every dev who wants to write GPU native code is going to find it easier to learn on Nvidia GPUs than AMD and libraries they could use to write their applications are more likely to be supported on Nvidia GPUs. It‚Äôs not insurmountable, but AMD hasn‚Äôt made any progress in years of trying. There isn‚Äôt really a massive pool of VLSI talent and that talent is expensive and constantly competing with higher paying tech jobs in Silicon Valley.The point about fabs are irrelevant. Everyone is fabless but Intel and Samsung.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 18:20:03'] They do have direct competition? Intel and AMD in the gpu market, Broadcom and Intel in networking. They have only two main advantages, Cuda, and better software (drivers)(for stability) which gives them control over the enterprise market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 22:15:04'] OP is a musky simp
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 03:23:16'] They made dx11 on nvidia so  there is that fact to consider. They have always been on the edge of direct draw technology. ATi is like what Nintendo uses for development
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 23:29:11'] Don't know why you assume this market is easy to get in. This is cutting edge tech, they've been doing it for decades now. AMD can't keep up and they've been in for decades too. When even intel with some of the best engineers in the world can't come close you know it's not easy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 15:40:23'] I would give world‚Äôs to know what it‚Äôs like working at NVDA.  Because my theory on INTC is that they made life such hell for engineers (endless on-call and ownership creep) that the staff turn over (or attrition) outpaced effective ownership transfer.  And then everyone that knew how to get stuff done eventually left.  This is what happens when you make tool owners responsible for every damn thing and they don‚Äôt sleep for weeks.  Heh heh‚Ä¶ heh‚Ä¶ screw you Intel.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 20:56:31'] NVDA‚Äôs after hours low was $273.73 and it‚Äôs high was $276.75.Nothing about that is abnormal. What‚Äôs is abnormal is that you were somehow able to create a Reddit account, remember the password, and figure out how to create a post and use somewhat readable sentences with moderately correct spelling. You keep this up and mom might let you take the helmet off.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 22:15:37']  How does everyone forget? $NVDA fell 70% in a few months, from 350 to 110; actually, it has fallen 50% plus 4x since 2018, yet all the people in here keep saying it only goes up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 02:24:19'] Apart of the reason you will see crazy AH moves (quick move up or down) post the trading day is people have margin calls, sell orders, buy orders, and short positions they have to cover by a certain time. That means they are forced open or close a position. Its the reason big dick money usually only trades the first 30 minutes and last 30 minutes of a trading day. They need the liquidity to make sure instruments don't have crazy price action. News events are the exception. I've seen stock like Apple trade 1/3 of the days volume 8 mil shares in the last 5 minutes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 14:21:41'] >It's likely that the orders were filled due to a glitch in the system, or possibly because someone with insider knowledge took advantage of the situation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 16:57:30'] I feel its going to start falling soon, it rose to much on AI hype. But look at covid causing a huge bump in computer sales‚Ä¶.look now the have fallen as everyone got one. This wont be in their numbers for a bit i dont think.but i dont invest,. Dont have the money but i enjoy making educated guesses. It could pump for a bit but it now to high‚Ä¶..as well as the latest card wasnt that great and expensive. AI is cool but like with crypto and blockchain they pumped up everyone with hints of blockchain but overall it was hype more than true value(ai is at least a tangible thing) &#x200B;tech stocks are soo good damn illogical they run of hopes and wishes more than hey this is a good things that sells well. &#x200B;If musk tweeted that nvda is a nice card showing him gaming it would pump by 100s and 100s of millions. Then slowly fall. No other place pumps and dumps like tech so be careful as it might act against all your data points. Just because

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 07:48:42'] hold. NVDA waaaaay overbought. No reason for this stock to have pumped this much after 2 bad quarters. Also, semi companies that have reported are all saying "demand has decreased substantially". NVDA price to earnings does not justify current price. Market is overly optimistic on their AI investments, cloud services etc. Granted those are good moves in the long run, but at the moment remains speculative.  Their core gaming business continues to suffer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 13:57:38'] If it stays above that 196.4 prolonged amount of time you're probably screwed. I'd see how it interacts with the 204 to 212 points of resistance. If it starts coming off of that, then you could potentially add to this position and make some money. Otherwise, good luck.Did notice how it gapped up today in the past that's been a sign of the end of an over extended price. Could honestly float in this range until the 22rd a. Feb with earnings. Either way, I'm out until then.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 16:37:17'] No one can predict the future.  What you CAN do is learn to manage risk.  You have let these run far too far against you.  In trading it is MANDATORY to limit your risk, otherwise you will not possibly survive.  You MUST have some level of stop loss, say 10% or something that will preferably automatically sell you out for a small loss.  Small losses are MANDATORY in trading.  There is no other way to avoid large losses.  Most people think in trading there are only two possible outcomes:  The price goes up or down.  In fact there are five.  Large gains, small gains, break even (rare), small losses, and large losses.  The first three outcomes of course are fine.  But you MUST be willing to expect and accept small losses roughly 50% of the time.  Then the small losses will most likely merely offset the small gains, leaving large losses avoided and large gains retained.  Again, small losses, although painful, are the ONLY way to avoid large losses.  Does this make sense?

It‚Äôs all dependent on how PCE comes out tomorrow if we get a higher print and NQ sells off with INTC bad report and the NQ pulling it down we could see a good red day but it needs to break 190 and make a test at 185 to confirm the move down. I‚Äôd expect it to trade flattish on Monday and similar today on Tuesday to wait for AMD‚Äôs report. If AMD misses you should be close to ITM at that point. You might look at selling the June 16th 140 puts to hedge the down move with 142 being a resistance level you could use to short on the break to cover if needed. That just gives you an option so you wouldn‚Äôt have to take a loss and possible miss the move down.

NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM\n\nIn theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like "NVDA is like a dog" so it will "underperform".\n\nMaybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)\n\nSome hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT\n\nWow! Will the Algos reverse and sell tomorrow?\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens'

Many companies do this, and many companies that do this let it expire without selling anything.  For example they may be doing it in case the recession happens and gets bad, if they find a company they want to acquire, or whatever other reason.  It's called a shelf offering because it sits on the shelf in case it is needed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:24:11'] Careful here... this chart is showing that a new level of resistance is building if this level holds. That means we are back in an uptrend if this low holds. And as January goes, historically so goes the year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:57:00'] So I guess calls.Bit late for puts.Especially late if people tell to buy puts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 13:13:31'] Time to short was at $300, not $150
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:14:45'] Yes, but not because you highlighted a falling wedge like it meant anything. NVDA is going to have a dog shit Q4 because their 4000 series is a scam, internal sales numbers must be horrendous since they decided to scale back production due to lack of demand. When not even scalpers are buying it, you know it's bad. Also with the current economy where companies are either going bankrupt or scaling back and firing people, neither consumer nor corporate side of sales look good for NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 14:37:46'] Let me tell you something about nVidia.  New cards are not selling, they blatantly increased the cost per mm of silicon and upsold the 4080s for no good reason.  The new specification they are working with have the first generation of data cable pins on the power connectors:  and they fucking suck cuz they are so flimsy that they released a liability statement saying you are only guaranteed so many plugs/unplugs before failure.  The crypto mining crash has crippled their whales that they nurtured at the expense of the rest of us, likely will not recover any time soon.  They also mistreated EVGA business partners to the point of EVGA reorganising so they never have to work with nVidia ever again.  Finally, they were just an unethical company to begin with:  they patented so much code and applications of the technology that other brands aren't allowed to make even remotely similar rendering techniques without being sued up the ass.  They singlehandedly held the gaming industry back 10 years and almost successfully monopolized the global market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 13:29:00'] It will depend on the RTX 4070/TI pricing and performance in reality.They hacked off lots and lots of their customer based with mining hash rate limiters and now with 4000 pricing. The 4080 was a clanger.A RTX 4070 should be around ¬£500/$600 inflation adjusted. My gut tells me they will aim at ¬£850/$950.I'm not sure what their marketing and pricing teams are smoking but I would say puts are worthwhile if the price point is anywhere near the AMD 7900xt

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 14:38:51'] >I completely agree with you that AI is not going to change the world in the way everyone thinks it will. In fact, I think it could actually make people less creative and contribute to the ruin of society. Congress will probably try to regulate AI development, which would make it not as great as it should be. And China is definitely a risk factor when it comes to Taiwan ‚Äì if they land on that island, all those factories could be gone overnight.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 22:09:20'] China cannot go into Taiwan without EXTREME backlash from the majority of the world (the US being the most noteworthy).And in case you weren't paying attention, China is highly dependant on those countries for their energy and food.Russia is mostly independant energy and food wise, so they can handle the embargos. China doesn't and cannot handle it.In truth, nobody gives ashit about Ukraine. It's just an excuse to finance a proxy war and weaken russians who were stupid enough to start a needless war.Taiwan makes high quality chips that everybody needs, especially with the current trend of adding useless electrical gadgets on modern cars (and EV especially).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 15:17:38'] Agreed on the point that AI isn‚Äôt gonna change the world in a way that Internet did ( the words from the mouth of rapacious Bill Gates), because AI has been out there for decades. NVDA seems to be very opportunistic in the ChatGPT momentum and they did the same in the 2017 crypto mining enthusiasm. I am not sure about the China part though. Nevertheless, I will not get in at this price

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 21:00:32'] I don‚Äôt know if right now is the best time to buy NVIDIA because of macro economic factors but NVIDIA will go up. Anyone working in the industry knows that NVIDIA will rule for the next several years. Even competing chip makers need NVIDIA to develop their own chips-> It‚Äôs not a joke. A friend of mine told me their company bought A100 for $25,000/ea. Those used to be $10,000/ea just two months ago but due to extremely high demands for AI those chips are now hard to get. You need eight A100s to handle one quarry. Countries are buiding gigantic data centers all over the world to run in this AI race. Those data centers will be filled with NVIDIA chips. NVIDIA has no competitors at this moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 23:28:43'] You are buying nearly exactly when Google decided to point out that they are a competitor to Nvidia‚Äîwhich means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend is going to be laughing big time next week.One of us.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:18:35'] It‚Äôs overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:40:12'] Their book value is $8.97, and they have tremendous exposure to China and Taiwan/TSM. Even with their solid earnings, they've steadily taken on enough debt to actually decrease the book value of their shares.Also, a lot of the big boys are looking to make their own chips. There will be a lot more competition in this market. I will also caveat this with the fact that I am a huge gay bear on semiconductors and chips right now, and am pretty loaded up on SOXS.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 15:53:48'] Undervalued at pe 155?Look at their revenue, inventory, near future outlook.Apple amazon google microsoft tesla all developing their own ai chips.Wake up..

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 20:22:39'] I'm bullish on the market but I'm not touching NVDA even with a 10 foot pole. It's previous earnings were okay, nothing extraordinary to measure up to its current price tbh.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:05:14'] One of bloomberg television segment had a couple of analysts discussing about new language in regards to "China investment curbs" and restrictions etc. They pointed out that Chips were already hit, but there might be more restrictions/export bans on the way. So my guess maybe it is because of the WH statements and algos didn't like it.Found it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnwLHGi18S8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnwLHGi18S8)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:31:44'] This is Tesla 2.0 right. I like the company and would loved to have stayed invested but I had to sell after the last run up. The risk reward is just not good right now. Having said that it is trading purely on hype I would not bother trying to short it either

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 02:34:10'] OP if I were you I would've bought puts with a further out expiration date (at least 3 months minimum), Nvidia could pump hard for regarded reasons. It has shown to in the past. If it pumps hard, then dips hard, you could make money off of selling CCs at the pump and the put at the dump.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 06:24:11'] As someone who‚Äôs down %61 on his 4/21 Puts, I wish you best of luck. It will come down, but when it‚Äôs a different story. AI will be huge but I think running  into a competitor soon, might also cut NVDA value as is. I think that the media is giving it a gigantic pump, too. I‚Äôm a long-term bull but this is too much too soon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 07:11:49'] The market overall, $spy is actually showing some strength. Yes, there‚Äôs a banking collapse, yes banks are failing, but the actual impact in the market won‚Äôt show until the fed can‚Äôt hide the problem anymore. Until they keep saying everything is alright we will continue to rally. We won‚Äôt know how bad the collapse  is possibly weeks, or even months! The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. NVDA probably go to $300 at this rate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 11:16:22'] If you want a slightly less risky option with no set expiration, buy shares in the inverse Nvidia ticker NVDS. 1.25 exposure

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 12:50:06'] The global trend for the last 30 years has been toward increased computing and automation.  That trend is likely to continue.  As a result, well managed chip companies are likely to do well in the long term.That said, there are always short term irregularities, news stories, other events that can cause positive and negative momentum on chip stocks.

Their last gen cards 3xxx could game at 4k resolution. 8K is nowhere on the horizon, nor needed, so nobody needs a 4xxx card. I expect serious slowdown in their high end PC market (VR/AR could renew this push if it materializes).Also ChatGPT can suck my nuts, and that includes you u/VisualMod (love you üòò) Wildly over hyped at this point, you‚Äôll stop hearing about this crap in 3 months.

Then they start to do a very small portion of the buyback say 3 billion over 2 quarters which at an average of 150 per share is around 20 million shares and reporting those buybacks along with pumping causes another 25% raise you're now up 45% in 180 days. After those 180 day and being up 45% you do a mixed shelf for say 10 billion and with the increased priced you selling at an average of 200 now increasing the shares buy 50 million.

This could allow CEOs and CFOs to pump up the stock price, sell their shares, and then buy them back at a lower price, essentially allowing them to profit while increasing the number of outstanding shares.

If the stock is overvalued, the insiders have been dumping decent amounts for over a month and it pumped on trash earnings, and economic and political climate are very tenuous why wouldn‚Äôt they pump on crap earnings only to sell into dilution. It‚Äôs not necessarily just the executives creating cash, it‚Äôs also potentially a lot of holders selling right before a potential decline over a the next few months. Either way I‚Äôm leveraged to the downside cuz this POS ain‚Äôt worth it‚Äôs valuation and it‚Äôs earnings call was trash. That pump was big boys selling the top and since the options in the 230s look like they are about to become dehedged soon it‚Äôs gonna get volatile.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 15:41:08'] >The SEC may be allowing Nvidia to do a 10 billion mixed shelf, but that does not mean it is setting a precedent for other companies. This is because each company's situation is unique, and the SEC would likely only allow such a move if it believed that it was in the best interests of shareholders. Additionally, even if the SEC did set a precedent with Nvidia, there is no guarantee that other companies would follow suit. Each company must make its own decisions about what actions are in its best interests, and many factors would need to be considered before deciding whether or not to pursue a similar strategy.

Other tech companies have also slowed or stop (not talking Amazon or google). \n\nCould insider activity (sell of stocks and pause in hiring) be a hint into what insiders are seeing (slow growth) and what market is pricing (increased growth). \n\nIs NVDA the biggest short of 2023?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 19:24:02'] >1. It's possible that the insider activity is indicative of slowing growth, but it could also just be coincidence. 2. NVDA is definitely one of the most popular shorts right now, but there are a few other companies that are being heavily shorted as well (AAPL, TSLA, etc.). 3. I think NVDA will continue to be volatile in the near future, but I don't think it will be the biggest short of 2023 necessarily.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 20:05:32'] NVDA over 228 is extremely bullish. I‚Äôd wait to see if it can break out over that level first before shorting it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 04:29:57'] I have the 200 puts for this week, so I advise buying the 220 calls
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 20:01:18'] Bought a bunch of 200p today near the peak. I don't expect it to have good earnings. But man, this stock is so manipulated by big funds, it might not even drop at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 21:33:45'] The whole AI (Chat GPT) talk will fuel the biggest rally in NVDA. Dont bet against the biggest benefactor of the AI revolution. NVDA is the only company that makes the top end AI chips
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 19:29:38'] How much would you short with NVDA vs like Tesla? Never done it before but definitely want to try
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 20:47:28'] ‚ÄúWhat market is pricing (increased growth)‚ÄùWas that what the market was pricing when it went down almost 70%?NVDA was the biggest short of 2022. You may still make money shorting this year but the time was when Ethereum decided to move away from mining with GPUs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 21:41:27'] I think I‚Äôd wait for the other shorts to over sell it and drive it down. Then buy deep in the money calls when I think it‚Äôs getting ready to rebound. Way less risk when taking this approach.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 19:52:40'] Was thinking of buying puts around 230-240 if it gets there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 21:12:39'] Think AI. This would be the time to go long.  50%+ upside
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 22:50:09'] Looking at my indicators of RSI, standard trend lines and fib, and MA's.MA hit a daily golden cross but with it peaking out and having some strong bear candles, and RSI is showing a bearish divergence despite the pump, and its indicating a correction will come soon. Down to what? I don't know for sure. If it heads down to test the trend line, I'd expect a slow drop to $180ish by end of the month if it indeed drops, but if indeed the golden cross stays true, we'll see a moderate correction and recovery continuation.But again, people could go full peak regard autist and pump it further before a correction. Happened to Ford last week.If I was a betting man, puts for early March.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 05:38:45'] Edit- little too aggressive before. Gotta work on that. Edited comment is now Well.. guess it‚Äôs time to buy calls.

The real money in the near-ish future is in AI, which they are a major player in the development/implementation of. We're already seeing the first steps in self driving vehicles, but there are so many things in life which can be streamlined by ai, and the big 3 tech companies are all at the forefront of development. Also notable thing is that Intel is vastly undervalued right now, and in the long term will only trend upward.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 16:53:17'] Honestly, looking at the fall of crypto, which was a huge factor in fueling their earnings, and its high pe ratio in comparison to intel and amd. Then look at it from the consumer's viewpoint: it took a long time to get their 3000 series card and they don't want to upgrade just yet since it can handle games at max settings very well. Those who had 2000 series card probably already upgraded it to the 3000 series.TLDR: Demand for GPU for mining is drastically down; demand for GPU for gaming will probably be  lower than for the 3000 series. so go bearish

Cloud (crm) also weak.Right now on a technical basis bulls are in control based on the cpi and jpow speech results. I don't think they look that strong and are getting exhausted well before real resistance. Most likely due to how far the low is below them. That's fear inducing.Watch the DMI and look for bears to take control on the 4hr and greater time frames. We are either in a topping process or bears are starting to enter. Most likely the big hitters are waiting for FOMC so they don't get blown out. I'd expect some jitters before the meeting. Short term is up, but I don't think it can go much farther. I'd sell anything close to 177. (200 day MA)185ish is the previous peak and also represents overhead supply. Another potential entry point depending on price action If it hits 204.7 I am all in on puts. That's the 400 day MA.

POST_TEXT: b"Chat GPT is great and is a game changer but its not going to change the fact that the PC market is drastically slowing, so is crypto(miners). Its also not going to solve all the worlds problems. If anything its going to put alot of people out of work.  The expectation that all these AI companies will somehow needs alot of new chips doesnt make sense. The services are live now and everyone that needed chips to launch their bots(Chat GPT; Google; Microsoft etc) already have what they need. This reminds me of the time when everyone thought broadband was going to be huge and super expensive. Same hype was around crypto. This is just another boom cycle. The time to buy NVDA was 3 months ago.\n\nAlso there is still AI regulation and laws to be created. If you think AI will write your resume, cover letter, college essay or do your work for you, it wont. Restrictions are coming. \n\nI just don't think NVDA is worth the current valuation and has an opportunity to drop to $180 in the near term."

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 19:03:52'] Tesla.. they still have a lot of room to grow market share, and can do so profitably. There's growing competition but they won't ramp EV production so easily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 20:02:03'] Neither lol. Rates are still rising
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 18:40:13'] Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 15:51:39'] I think Musk/TSLA is mostly facing retribution for the document dumps and the embarrassment it's causing a lot of naughty people that happen to also have money. Easy to spot the successive days of massive shorting going on - if not for that TSLA would be fine...NVDA on the other hand, not so much...

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 16:15:30'] TSLA is finally facing the competitive threats it has long missed out on as the big guys finally cannon ball into the deep end with their EV lineups, it has more room to the downside, while NVDA is more expensive on this chosen metric it is more nimble as it‚Äôs chips can go into many directions, you can‚Äôt do the same with an automobile‚Ä¶they both are pricey no question

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 05:38:58'] I'd buy TDLA in a second if Musk handed over control to someone else and took a position as chairman. Companies need regular control and I'm not a fan of having a CRO pulled so thin.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 07:55:44'] Neither, the govt will have blackrock short the fck out of TSLA now and nvidia is still too expensive on a PE basis in this environment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 14:14:25'] Never thought I would type something like thisTesla. Their balance sheet is much better even if they have a growth rate of zero. Lower PE makes it an easy call.Wouldn't buy either. FWIW I sold my Tesla put yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 15:04:44'] How about neither?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 15:35:13'] Neither as I think both of them lost their "monopoly". Tesla has far too many other companies competing in the electric car market, and Nvidia might have a problem with AMD's new cards.If I had to buy, and use my brain, then both and dollar cost average in.If I had to buy like a community member, flip a coin and full leverage.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 19:00:36'] Let Tesla shake out a bit more and then buy.   It should be at a PE Ratio of like 25.Nvidia is on borrowed time with the Intel and AMD integrated graphics getting as good as they are.  Even the Xbox Series X and PS5 use APUS as a window in to the future so in 10 years Nvidia will have data center and the ultra high end.  None of the mid and low end consumer GPU segment. They don't have an x64/x86 license.

In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.\n\nGaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off \nIn the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and bloc"

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 10:13:10'] Crypto miners being only 2.7% of  their revenue is a flat out lie. Miners were buying gaming gpus to mine, no way to figure out the real percentage. My guess is it was closer to 30%

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 10:55:41'] Gaming is a known market. I don‚Äôt think there will be any big surprises. Covid juiced up game revenue for a year or two but it is reverted back to the mean now. What I am excited about and not on many people‚Äôs radar is their datacenter virtual GPU offerings. Rich content and digital assets are being created at an unprecedented rate. Older computers are being replaced with light-spec laptops and workloads are shifted to data centers with virtual GPUs. This is currently not a huge market yet, but it could develop into a major profit center if the trend continues. I used to demand a physical beefy machine under my desk, but now I only want a 16-inch laptop and 2 32-inch monitors and a good-spec VM that fits my need.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 07:35:04'] Which new gen consoles are using Nvidia?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 06:34:33'] >I completely agree with SlenderMan69. NVIDIA is poised for big things in the gaming industry, and their GeForce NOW platform is leading the way in cloud gaming. With global gaming revenue projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, there is huge potential for NVDA to continue growing at a rapid pace. So buckle up and hold on tight, because NVDA is about to take us all on a wild ride to the moon!

If you went back far enough in time and told people you own a $10k a year business their minds would be blown, today it's a side hustle. In a thousand years that $10k a year business will be a trillion dollar industry at 2% inflation.Statements like this are meaningless, but idiots think it means something cause man on TV said words. Without "in 10 years" it's not even hot air, it's air.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 11:37:23'] Cramer's brain was accidentally removed from his head in 2009 during a dental procedure that went horribly wrong.  Ever since that tragic day, the brainless Cramer has been giving increasingly worse investment advice to his impoverished followers.  Technically, Cramer should not even be alive, but somehow he manages to to work fulltime at CNBC.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 11:38:00'] Jim Cramer lost me when he said to buy Bear Stearns.  This guy is an entertainer not a financial advisor.  The other thing is if he so good why is he on TV and not out there doing these trades as a professional fund manager?  This business is extremely risky.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 05:06:11'] Most people with an expensive PC are either the IT type that earn well and working on a family or the lazy wellfare type, now ask yourself if new graphic cards will sell well during a time in which people struggle to pay their bills and crypto is sleeping. You will thank me in two months, both have a long way down to go.By the way, NVDA didn't go up merely because people started working at home, their sales were heavily influenced by Crypto miners.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:25:20'] I think AMD. Their product portfolio is more diverse and their hardware is more impressive from a technical standpoint in many respects.Nvidia is definitely a fair-weather company from a stock perspective. It will be up when crypto is up, and crypto will be good if interest rates and inflation go down. That's not going to happen for a while yet. AMD has several opportunities for growth and I don't believe it will mirror crypto so closely moving forward.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 05:56:43'] AMD, I agree with the upgrades they received recently.  I bought 200 at 60 a share.  I continue to sell 60 puts to increase my holdings with them. Also NVDA at 110 was steal also only picked up 50.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:43:09'] I went for AMD at 56$ and TSMC at 62$, long. And I am thinking about KLAC, it's first in the chain of semiconductors production.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 06:02:49'] None of both.   Texas Instruments Inc. or TSMC.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 05:52:00'] Among AMD's "main projects" is "discovery of Mars"? Errrm oookaaay.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 07:32:01'] I remember when AMD was $1.89 and it got the most hate from all chip makers and hedge funds. Look at it now. Makes me disgusted how hard they jump on the wagon now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 06:01:57'] AMD all day. They're doing well in the data center market, and I believe in the coming years  more money will be poored into data center production, and the push for more edge.   Even if their consumer Market drops I feel their Data Center side of buisness will more than cover that. Plus all there embedded hardware deals and phone.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 13:17:40'] "would" - I don't understand posts like this. Everybody here has the opportunity to invest in any of those options. They either did it or they did not. If they did then why say "would"? If they didn't then this fact by itself proves they didn't believe it was the right decision to make, so what meaning would it have if they would just *say* "I would choose XYZ"? It's just an obvious lie in that situation. What's the point of asking such questions?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 13:39:05'] nowadays looks better Amd, but i dont know the future, probably AMD will growth less than NVDA because AMD its not a chip producer for the new requirements (cell phones , EVs , television,  machinery) if both are in same conditions i think its a no brainer TO bet on amd

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:48:05'] I love both companies products (I have an and cup and NVDA GPU) but I think there is more potential in NVDA as there AI is incredible. they made the NASA super computer, they have ray tracing, Nvidia canvas and DLSS and FSR are equal. &#x200B;AMD have branched out into both markets and have tried to use this to get people to buy an AMD CPU and GPU (if you have both they can share memory and work better.) although NVDA are working on a CPU which would remove the advantage AMD has with its smart memory. &#x200B;I think both will do well but NVDA better but intel will start to struggle as they can't seem to keep up with AMD or NVDA. &#x200B;if APPL start optimising mac and there M2 chips for gaming they could beat both as the mac studio is amazing value for money and APPL have so much power to disrupt a market (e.g. apple watch, iphone, ipad, airpods) which dominate there target market (apple watch controls 55% of the market.)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 04:48:24'] The do pretty much have monopoly over AI hardware. But it is not just hardware. Way back in late 2000s they realized the potential that GPUs have for computation and started creating CUDA software toolkit. CUDA empowered developers to create powerful Machine Learning codes that leveraged GPUs, early 2010s. That is when ML caught on fire. So nowadays 90% of ML code infrastructure uses CUDA which only works with NVIDIA hardware. You can see that if a new hardware wants to compete with them has a giant hill to climb. Google tried creating their own hardware TPU, but it did not caught on outside of google. That is not to say the startups that are working on new hardware for AI are doomed, but NVIDIA is way way way ahead.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 20:05:50'] I hold puts on NVDA. And buy more puts on each bear market rally. So, obviously biased, but here's an important point you did not mention.Data center sales for expensive GPUs is a very lagging indicator. These GPUs are great, essential for ML training workloads and nVidia has a monopolistic position in the market. Their APIs and frameworks are unmatched, although Intel and AMD are slowly creeping in.Everyone will tell you how great data center sales are, how they are growing and that this matters the most, and thus you can ignore poor retail sales.However, data center sales by large cloud providers are planned at least a year ahead. I'm talking about AWS, AZURE, and GCP.When the pandemic hit, large clouds were caught off guard and did not have enough capacity to meet the demand. As everyone else in the economy, they over reacted and over provisioned. Chip shortage made situation much worse, as they couldn't fullfil their orders for a year.Now, those orders are coming in and the demand isn't there anymore. Again, like everyone else, large clouds now have more capacity than there's demand in the market. And all tech CEOs are confident recession is coming. They all almost froze hiring, many top companies went through at least one round of layoffs, reduced budgets, spending and capital investments. Cost optimizations are everywhere.And what those large clouds will cut first when they believe recession is around the corner, and they are already over provisioned and expect demand to fall further? New and expensive chips will be the first to go.As tech over reacted on the up side they will now over react on the down side. Nvidia sales reflect orders from 2020-2021, that's like housing demand from May 2021. Those sales have already cratered, but are not reflected in the quarterly reports yet. Once they do you will see a sharp drop, surprised analytics, huge earnings miss and confused dip buyers.Once everyone starts talking how bad data centers sales are, I'll close my puts.For nvidia to become a buy again I'll need to see some leaks about their new generation of chips with better cost/efficiency ratio. This is what market wants and nvidia can't deliver. Currently nvidia is trapped overpaying for the best TSMC node to produce expensive energy hungry products with falling demand. That will drag their profit margins down even further until they improve efficiency and negotiate a better deal with foundries.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 09:00:52'] The cool thing about percentages is that it can lose 50% of the 50% it already lost. Just buy the puts already ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 09:16:45'] Discrete GPU sales are the lowest in 20 years. Low/mid range stuff isn't expected for quite a few months, so guess it depends on how long you want to go. They gained market share and AMD didn't really hurt them with RDNA3 and the performance isn't going to challenge them much this generation. And their pricing is just as whack. So.. shrug.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 09:55:40'] I am pretty bearish for NVDA in a short term. Under the current rate environment, their main revenue stream from data center will unlikely to produce strong growth. Other growth areas will take time to pan out. The stock price already down 50% from the peak but the PE ratio remaining very high. Longer term NVDA has good growth potential because it is well positioned in AI growth areas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:36:04'] The bullish argument: Is there any bearish argument left that isn't priced in?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 15:28:42'] NVDA graphics cards are much better than AMD for ML workloads. ML training workloads increase in their size every year as the industry cranks out ever better models. I firmly disagree on companies cutting their ML development in a deteriorating environment; for many companies, strong ML IS the economic future of their company. NVDA stays high because as much as things could possibly deteriorate in the short term, in the mid to long term, NVDA makes one of the most critical products for the advancement of technology. When it dips, people will buy it, and at some point, we‚Äôre going to get a bullish tech market again and the shares will achieve an even greater premium. Their growth prospects in the ~10 year span are better than most mega cap companies, yet they are also one of the safest growth investments out there. No doubt, you might make money playing NVDA, but I would watch out how long you‚Äôre short.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 19:22:55'] Devil's advocate semis and transports tend to bottom first. While I agree NVDA is still over valued I would almost rather buy QCOM than short NVDA here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 16:35:30'] I believe NVDA will fall but enough other people also think that that it's pretty hard to short. You will get squeezed by insane bounces. For options to work you need to get the timing right, not just the direction.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:46:42'] NVDA GPU is like TSLA. Because of time to market, they reign in supremacy. With AI/ML taking front and center, GPUs will be in great demand for 2023+. But NVDA GPU does have competition. AMD has a much cheaper alternative. Benchmarks show that performance is comparable. We know that Datacenter/Cloud business is expanding. But will AMD be ready for the Cloud business surge in 2023 or 2024? Not sure. Plus, Fed is certainly not done raising interest rates. My call - NVDA has a reasonable run rate ahead in 2023 but not what we saw in 2021-22.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:48:33'] Real rates are already way too high for an economy built upon cheap credit. The fed will pivot and light a fire under shares of overpriced tech shares like NVDA long before rate rises actually have a chance to arrest price inflation. Even the dishonest fed people know this that's why they incessantly lie about price inflation...which has clearly not been "transitory".  If you're going to short this sucker down 50% already, then you'd better watch the fed like a hawk as one whiff of backing off their token rate hikes could lead to a monster tech rally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:09:47'] Upside will.come from either government or business side, Government cloud will buy more nvda hardwareNew man less vehicle and planes More business has to adopt It has to be the business spending to save them, as business is using pretax dollar, consumer used after tax doller, so gaming is really hard to take off, the only thing is from business side, Trump has 6 year tax loss on his business, but his business total value goes up, i.e his real estate, he is the biggest con on the Democrat controlled system
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 11:14:11'] If everything is cyclical, short term bear with more rate hikes and talk of recession. I'm expecting market to keep taking a beating. Long term bull as I'm a fan boy of them and fell they have great long term plays in mind.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 06:34:31'] AMD anyday. Excellent management, good execution, solid roadmap and synergy in acquisitions. And it appears that they are all set to do their game on Nvidia the same way they played intel.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 06:33:26'] Nvidia can manufacture CPUs as an ARM signatory, is the golden standard on floating point, and is diverse in terms of revenue.  AMD is imbedded with HOT!!! CPUs, second tier GPU, and automotive. Neither are done going down.   If I had to pick one, I would go with Nvidia. Apple has moved to ARM, they won't be the last. The market will crack into to several shards, but RISC is back, CISC is dying. AMD can make that pivot, Nvidia is already there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 05:27:32'] I have to agree with Cathie here.  Nvidia is heading into tough economic conditions where they are selling gas guzzling Lambos and everyone wants fuel efficient Teslas.AMD's Navi 31 is the first step into chiplet based GPU's.  AMD has been doing it for years now with  Zen  and I would imagine they now have the ability to take the performance crown away from Nvidia in the next generation (or sooner if they respin the Navi 31 silicon).7900 XTX is within 15% of the 4090 based on preliminary benchmarks.  The 4090 is also priced 60% higher than the 7900 XTX ($1,600 vs $999) and the 4080 is priced 20% more than the 7900 XTX ($1,200 vs $999).  In short I don't believe Nvidia can hold their prices long term if they expect the same volumes as the last generation which included massive crypto mining.Nvidia trading at a 40x multiple.  I expect earnings to take a major hit in the next fiscal year.  I could see that pulling back to a 30x and and earnings halved.  i.e..  Major downside potential.

HOWEVER!!!My play on this is buying calls Monday morning 11/14, if it drops to about 161ish. Gonna ride the rally to earnings, maybe around 180 or so then, the day before earnings, buy puts.   I have a feeling they didn't beat it and with the release and issues with the 40 series these last few months on top of economic restraints, inflation, chinas restrictions with a potential other covid outbreak the last few months too, I'm banking on Puts for 11/16  IMO We'll see how $500 goes.

Like many, we could‚Äôve all sold before the dump, but we didn‚Äôt because we‚Äôre greedy and thought the stock would go up today because of earnings. Now what? My calls expire on March 11th at a strike price of $255; shall I cut my losses or hold the bag, hoping that it comes up again?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 07:36:09'] After Nvidia maxed out at 225ish in September, it ran up to 300+. It was overpriced the moment the Arm deal fell through (it was speculative at that point). After a pullback it went on a bull run before earnings because everyone and their mother expected them to beat. It was priced in. Now it's falling back down to earth and it's also a red day overall across the market so this is where we're at.

Maybe it gets said so often that people actually think it's just a memeBy the time you've done your DD and think a company's outlook is good, every hedgefund and professional investor has already considered your "newfound" information twice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 07:49:43'] JFC....is this amateur hour at the Apollo??How many times do we have to explain?  BEATING EXPECTED EARNINGS IS NOT SPECIAL.  Something like over 80% of all S and P 500 companies will beat expected earnings.  I'll repeat it again.  A beat is.not.special. In fact, a beat is pretty much expected and the bare minimum required to pass an ER.  The only way an earnings beat will pump a stock is if it is truly a gigantar beat that is way, way, wayyyyy over expectations.  NVDA's beat was not 'massive'.  Secondly, learn kindergarten fundamentals.  NVDA was trading almost at 80 P/E.  Do you not understand what that means?  It means NVDA is massively overvalued and priced for absolute perfection.  Growth going forward has already been priced in.  When growth stocks reach such extreme valuations, it leaves absolutely zero room for error.  Any signs of weakness will tank the stock while the upside is extremely limited because so much of it has been priced in.  Forward guidance for such an extremely expensive stock needs to be a WOW YOU BLEW MY MIND WITH SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.  NVDA did not provide that. They projected higher, but it was nothing truly, stupendously amazing.  That's the problem with chasing shit with such extreme valuations.  Companies just cannot keep up with expectations to make stock prices grow.  Expectations need to fall back down to reality and need to reset.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 10:19:04'] It's algos configured to inverse sentiment and, because the computers drive direction, not humans, they win.  Everybody was bullish on team green.  They executed an absolutely PERFECT quarter and stated they were going to beat next quarter by a billion dollars.But everybody was bullish on team green, so the high frequency trading machines get set to kill and drive down the price to kill options and cause shareholders to panic sell.Some people will talk about PE, acting like dinosaurs that demand single digits in every sector, but that's not what did it.This, for the record, is why I constantly preach to not play earnings.  It's just not worth it because it's like Whose Line where the points don't matter.  It's why I dumped every option I have in team green 2 days ago to get out of the way of earnings and said I would be back in next week no matter what up or down.  I knew the company was going to crush it, but I also knew the computers saw the social sentiment was bullish and the way to make the most money was to kill it.Meanwhile, $DASH missed badly on the top line and announced they were blowing more money than ever.  But everybody was bearish, so it shot up 25%.  Because everybody was bearish.Inverse WSB isn't a meme, and it's not because the ideas here are generally bad.  It's because the machines watch this place and go the other direction from sentiment to steal your tendies.  The sooner you accept that, the better off you'll be

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 08:09:11'] I predicted in other thread that Nvidia will drop no matter what for one simple reason. They can't make enough cards to sell, even there is massive demand due chip shortages across the entire sector. Another reason is just look at Nvidia chart and zoom out it's like bitcoin just straight up unrealistic parabolic growth with no major pullbacks.

This may change as you have more players entering the market,this may not.what does seem to apply is the expected volatility going into earnings. the expected move compared to historical is usually within the range. So now it becomes a bet on what strategy can capture this move the best.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-18 12:36:39'] Revenue gains mean nothing for future potential. It's all about revenue gains and profit gains.If I made more revenue but my net profit margin goes down. This is Bad. This means the company has to buy others or load up on all kinds of overhead to get more business and it's less profitable. This means the company can't grow because it makes no sense because it's less profitable.  Why would anyone want to invest more capital to make less profit? Anyone? Now when a company has revenue increases and net profit increases that's the golden fuckin egg. That means as the business grows and sells more services they also are making more net profit on the sales. Sky's the limit and expansions are free money.So that's why revenue beats themselves don't mean shit. Anyone can go spend mega bucks buying acquisitions to improve revenue but if your net profit margin tanks in doing so you're investing in new business that makes LESS money than before. Look at trends of the ratio of revenue increases against net profit changes and how that trends and measures up.

The simultaneous action, the highest volume sales, the contrariness to strong earnings, cannot come from retail investors, and can only come from coordinated action by institutional funds that lent, hedge funds that borrowed, and brokerages that brokered the borrowing.If anyone thinks the market is free and fair, after so many instances similar to NVDA, for no other plausible reason, the seller of the Brooklyn Bridge is waiting eagerly for you.It is time to reinstate the uptick rule established by the SEC on 1938 under Rule 10a-1 that prohibits short selling unless the preceding trade was an uptick.  This rule was revoked in 2007, and in one year or less, we had the market meltdown of 2008, due perhaps to a mere over-extended 250 billion bad mortgages that accelerated into a collapse of trillions of dollars of CDS, and the failure of Lehman and AIG.  The hole in the dike could have been plugged with a finger, but the finger, Rule 10a-1 was the one that was banned.https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110614/why-short-selling-legal-brief-history.aspIn 2010, Rule 201 was instituted to reinstate the uptick rule but only if the price had fallen more than 10% in one day, and requiring only that the offer to sell be above the highest bid (which is easy to work around).  In name it supposedly allows the real owners of the shares to sell before the shorts, but in reality, the shorts had liberty to sell down the stock by 10%, whether or not the real share owners had already sold their shares at all.  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 08:01:35'] It crashed because of many things. Mining is down, selling less cards, ARM sale failed, and more market share being given up based on facts and rumours to AMD and Intel.It's not just about metrics but also outlooks on the futures.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 08:42:36'] The stock has been rallying since its split , you can't just expect stock to rally every time it delivered an awesome earning and guidance.. the big picture is geopolitics and pressure on Metaverse ..FB and Roblox .  Plus....look at the chart before earning...it was a triple tops ...that was why I didn't play its earning this year. Just my two cents
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 08:45:22'] Maybe learn to strangle?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 08:46:34'] One huge factor is that the entire market is shit right now. It's hard to tell though where some legitimate deals are. GOOG seems cheap as fuck considering the split but a lot of people are probably waiting until it actually splits to buy. NVDA can fuck itself. Not for any real reason other than it can go ahead and fuck itself.

But, the Tuesday buy frenzy WAS the earnings buy bump.By the time earnings were released, everyone had already bought Nvidia and no one was left buying... Everyone just waiting for other people to buy so they can cash in their tendies....You fucking idiots.Since no one bought after earnings, everyone started panic selling.I say again...

There‚Äôs a chip shortage still, so that‚Äôs probably why they‚Äôre getting sold out immediately, they can‚Äôt make enough. AMD has GPUs coming that are cheaper and as good as the 3090. And crypto has been dropping causing miners to flood the market with used GPUs. And their conference / livestream that they had was trash, nothing cool coming up. I‚Äôm going puts but I‚Äôve got to be one of the unluckiest people on the planet. So this shit gonna make me broke and get me off the stock market til next year.

Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. \n\nAlthough NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders.

NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 04:49:32'] It is always the same whenever NVDA releases new GPUs. Last year they released tiny amounts and all were bought by bots to resell them to miners at higher prices. This time is the same, bots and scalpers snached the tiny amounts NVDA offered on launch, but guess what, prices will go down because there are no miners to buy them at insane prices and gamers cant pay these stupid prices for a GPU.NVDA will follow AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 08:59:04'] I wanted to buy calls but now am definitely buying puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 05:27:47'] Early release hype...The 3000 series are becoming much cheaper and most consumers will likely navigate to those as they prices continue to decline.You can get a used 3080ti for less than 1000 (CAD)And a new one for 1300 (CAD).  This unit will be enough to max out games and office productivity for CAD softwares for a very long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 20:34:21'] So gaming will replace all crypto mining demand? Doubtful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 07:04:15'] I just bought parts to build a new computer yesterday. A new 3060 ti for $450 is what I went with. I have plenty of money, but I can't justify spending more than ~$800+ on a GPU. I think the prices are insane for Nvidia's cards and think they shot themselves in the foot. A 3060 ti is usually more than enough for 99% of games at 1080p, which is what most people are still on. I'll be surprised if they beat earnings. Very few people are buying 4090 GPUs, and people overall have less disposable income. The only CPU/GPU company I think we will see clearly beat earnings is Intel. Their new 13th generation CPUs are arguably better for most use cases than AMD chips, and they cost quite a bit less than the AMD chips competing at each price point. Also, apparently Intel Arc GPUs are selling fairly well, based on rumors. I'm biased against Nvidia right now though. They took advantage of the market when crypto was still gobbling up GPUs. Then the CEO says that "Moore's law is dead" to try to justify their 4000 series price gouging while they hold back lower tier 4000 series cards.Fuck Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 01:31:56'] >It looks like NVIDIA is in a strong position to weather the China ban and potentially benefit from it in the long term. The recent demand for their high-end GPUs shows that they are still in high demand despite the geopolitical risks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:47:30'] Nvidia has a rival now,Intel‚Äôs new Arc graphics cards are performing similar to their nvidia counterparts and they cost significantly less.With current situation people are more likely to buy intels cheaper one than overpay for similar nvidia performance

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 16:09:45'] Braindead DD.The premium people are paying for the 4090 is not remotely sustainable nor applicable to the rest of the market. Buyers are without a doubt willing to pay a massive mark up to "have the best of the best" as early as possible and once this very specific consumer is handled its going to dive bomb. The rest of the 4000 series will not remotely have the same sales hype (because they will be closer to sidegrades over the 3000 series) and the 3000 series is going to plummet in price once the 4000 series launches proper.Put your money in on the bet and feel stupid in a year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 16:25:29'] I was actually thinking the same thing after seeing so many reviewers gushing over these new cards on YouTube, might be something in it.

POST_TEXT: b'I just read a report that Goldman Sachs is predicting 300 millions jobs lost or degraded by AI. In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). Its amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isnt being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:28:49'] 300M jobs lost is BS. Take computer programmers for example. They still need a Product Manager who owns the product strategy and proposes a new piece of software. They will need to work with someone who understands the capabilities of software and what is feasible and define the requirements. Then the programmer will most likely use AI to help create the code, but will still need to test and debug the software. Then multiple iterations of this loop as they get feedback from customers etc. I see AI making jobs more efficient and effective, not necessarily replacing a bunch of people. AI will help software become even more prolific. As more products become electronic and integrated with IOT, we probably need 10X the number of programmers that we have today which won't exist because the lack of population growth. AI will make this possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:36:59'] I agree. Large language models look at large data sets and predict the most likely next word. They don‚Äôt insert blocks of data, like quotes. They don‚Äôt analyze them for validity. That‚Äôs where the hallucinations come into play. Inserting quotes and knowing the truth goes against the core concept. Fixing that problem at scale will be hard. They fix isn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt coming soon. The large language model is nice, but the true power is automation, not having a person in the middle to talk to it. People that are getting excited about the LLM are missing the point of automation.Most companies don‚Äôt have their data organized well enough for an AI to catalog at it. This will take years, if not decades. Jobs will change. We don‚Äôt do a massive shit ton of work due to capacity. People won‚Äôt be downsized. They‚Äôll just do more. Their jobs will change from what they are today. That‚Äôs ok. Data from Twitter and Reddit are over valued. Billions of unresearched, racist, low effort post and bots repeating talking points are ducking worthless to repeat and build an AI against. Tech investors are looking for their next get rich quick idea since crypto went bust. There really isn‚Äôt anything to invest in yet, so they‚Äôre trying to drive up the demand.

Sure, writers who need bland copy quickly and people who like AI generated art with the faces and hands all wrong are having some fun with it.  But AI is not very robust (yet), and it‚Äôs a long way from being autonomous and taking over all of society like Skynet did on August 29, 1997 at 2:14 am.But hey, everybody on Wall Street loves a good rumor that can blow stock values out of proportion so that some can ride the hype and get out before it dives.Once AI can make itself smarter, then we‚Äôll see it change everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:05:53'] In my experience, I dont know, how far this will take us.  I can tell you in tech things are moving quite fast and costs are declining. Example, at one startup, we used to pay Cloudfare 30k/month to cache, protect and stabilize a high traffic website. Last time, I checked with their team, the bill was reduced to $300/month. Six years ago, at another startup, we published a podcast and we had a junior marketing guy who handled the audio files, upload it to all the platforms, create snippets for promotional purposes and handle the SEO for the podcast, it was pretty much his full time job. Now, you pay $50/month to a podcast platform and it does all that job and the junior marketing guys only spends a couple hours once every week promoting podcasts to increase the audience. This startup now has 3 podcasts. So, I can tell you things are moving and who knows whats coming in the next five years.

You people working at AppleGoogleFacebookMicrosoft as a "Project Manager" or "Logistics coordinator" or even a junior programmer have no idea how useless you are, relative to your wage and the global averages in income. Someone can easily do your job in India for far less, and now AI can do it for far less as well. Doesn't necessarily make YOU completely obsolete, it's just your job is obsolete and is not worth paying you $100k++ for something that requires very little knowledge and intelligence compared to say, someone grilling burgers for their food truck, or a lettuce farmer in Central California.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:32:26'] I think they are spot on. If you do a job involving an office or work from home and it involves a pc then odds are future AI will do that job better , faster , no health insurance , no pay , in smaller facilities, 24/7.Think of all the call centres there are and how most calls are going to be - based on my past experience when I was student - largely relatively simple and covered by FAQ on the web site. Wait times are cause by human interaction. AI = little to no wait time. Investment ? Eventually AI will be using data and sources far in excess of what a human could and using that to make decisions . It‚Äôll change the market as you‚Äôll probably see less emotional investing and reactionary swings , but likely a potential for far greater engineered pricing.Every time there is a big societal change it‚Äôs resisted and people are convinced that the old ways are never going to be gone. Bring on the downvotes but it‚Äôll happen in our lifetime if you are 50 or under. That‚Äôs why countries are starting to look at universal basic income, partly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 15:19:10'] Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I don‚Äôt anticipate chatgtp or open ai being the point or good examples for corporate use of AI. I think corporates will train their own/purchased AI‚Äôs based on data sets either owned by them our bought for purpose.. and there‚Äôll be plenty of benefits into having a corporate champ that can put together all the data and draw conclusions, graphs and forecasts all based on data the company owns. You know how many people put their minds together to analyze data and create micro services for management, sales reps and the like. There‚Äôs plenty of other use such as in-house training courses, AI assistants to new hires and seniors. Basically fuck searching through 10 000 pages of knowledge-bases and courses. AI can standardize, it can correct and it can easily apply corporate governance. It can analyze performance based on metric data from Microsoft Viva, phone calls and sales etc. I guess my point is the data is already accessible and some poor soul probably goes through this shit on monthly reports showing KPI‚Äôs and sales performances etc.. but why not have one corporate AI that just swings this all the time and constantly keep track, give feedback, proposals etc. Then I think there will be companies manufacturing employee AI‚Äôs, basically training them for a specific role, could be a nurse, could be an IT operations person, could be a support agent, or any type of service job really. Now incorporate a bit of PAM & IAM for regulation purposes and to give the AI ways of executing tasks. It has the knowledge, it has the access to a variety of commands it can execute, it has the possibility to have a dialogue and troubleshoot, why wouldn‚Äôt it work? These little humanlike service AI‚Äôs will then be sold to companies, managed, trained and improved by its original makers. AI is also going to become a part of people‚Äôs everyday life‚Äôs, like it or not with smart homes, alarm systems, personal assistants.. you either get tech savvy or get left behind. You have google assistant making phone calls and booking appointments for you with a human like voice already, do you really think this isn‚Äôt going to happen?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 14:09:58'] I can't really argue that there are some overvaluations happening as a result of the hype. But it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.The legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. The job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.That is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.That being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.TLDR: Puts on tech

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 17:41:25'] I have a suspicion that ai will come to a point where the input will become too great for ai to be standardized. Too much power, too many parts/chips, and too many labor hours. That it will not be a feasible investment. Right now, it's cool and moving quickly, but eventually the price to make an upgrade in ai will be astronomical and will have a low ROE leading to only the pioneers continuing in the market if they can stay afloat. But I think it does have a place in reducing the number of people needed for repetitious tasks.

There's definitely been a lot of stuff happening since 2017, just maybe not consumer visible ones until generative AI. There's definitely a lot of hyperbole around generative AI by people who do not understand it, but the technology itself is not a bubble - there's really a ton of value behind machine learning that's been actualized and will be actualized in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:05:24'] People act as if AI is something new. Computer scientists have been working on this for decades. Generative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It‚Äôs a cool new application that people can experience first hand.But what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?The reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, they all follow each other. There‚Äôs nothing new about it and it‚Äôs a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.This is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there‚Äôs an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We‚Äôre seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it‚Äôs only getting started.Think back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it‚Äôs very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it‚Äôs very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.To me it‚Äôs a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren‚Äôt realizing that a lot of the crazes we‚Äôve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.But labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It‚Äôs probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It‚Äôd be like calling the Industrial Revolution ‚Äúa rail bubble‚Äù.

Things that dont require a lot of effort but not a lot of attention will be replaced, quickly.. Look how an AI won a photography contest. These are humam judges, who are professionals.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 00:48:13'] I think 300M jobs lost is an over-exaggeration. If that many people lose jobs, they won't have money to spend, and thus the economy including all the companies are gonna go into a shithole cuz they'd all be losing money. I can't say how many jobs could be lost for the short-term, but I reckon it would be a decent amount, but not enough to break the economy. I reckon, instead of AI replacing everyone, people will adapt to use AI as a tool to be more productive at their jobs. If anything, over the long-term, it could add more jobs, or at least improve the productivity of most jobs, and better the economy as a whole.

Like with crypto and NFTs, despite being some very tiny nugget of truth in there being a palpable business model, the overhype will kill it/ pump and dump it all.  AI has a bit more teeth than the past few bubbles and we damn well know companies will fire staff while not knowing the limits of AI so the fallout from this bubble might be a bit rough when the many that fail in being "the next best thing" have to come to the reality of their FOMO choices.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:22:16'] I agree with you completely except for the puts part.  Markets aren't rational in the short term, and many investors are very poorly informed on this topic, if they were well informed they would have been investing in Nvidia's stranglehold on CUDA 10 years, not now after Nvidia reaped much of the awards and it's baked into the high price already.  I think it will take them some time yet to come down off this high.    I'm not sure how we should gauge when the business cadre will suddenly realize AI isn't pushing the massive profits they seem to expect... because that's when you want the puts for.  Maybe it will show up in some disclosures or something, someone that follows the financial reporting schedules will know far better than I for that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 08:35:06'] Point taken and yes AI really needs better controls. Recall when the first Intel Pentium came out it had a bug that caused it to incorrectly calculate. This was in the field for months before anyone actually noticed the erroneous results in their spreadsheets and databases. Companies lost money because of the error.   I feel the same will happen with AI. The expectations are so high an not  too many people understand how to validate results. That said AI is not new - its over 60 years in development. What is new is the hardware (Tensocores) that accelerate it and the ability to use many of them to create large models became commoditized and not lab experiments.  It will make the average PC user a power user. It will take repetitive tasks, learn how you do them, and create much faster workflows. It will make all data available to all programs by being able to translate, merge and clean heterogenous datasets on the fly.   This is HUGE.  With the Internet over 80% of a companies data comes from external sources. For home users it is over 93%.  Stated another way - The Macintosh was revered for making computing easy to use. AI is the next step - making computing fully adaptive to the user.   And of course AI is the core of robotics and automation advances.

They are pretty much already at their limit when it comes to scaling up, all they can do now is take GPT 5 and make it more efficient.

POST_TEXT: b" Hi everyone,\n\nI am thinking of shorting NVDA ahead of their earnings next week. Although I think in the long term NVDA is a great stock, I think their upcoming earnings will not meet expectations. My reasons are:\n\n\\- Not nearly as much hype for their newly released 40 series GPU cards compared to their 30 series.\n\n\\- Supply issues during their 30 series release and insanely high prices distanced many people from even thinking about buying an NVIDIA GPU card.\n\n\\- China lockdowns and economic troubles, in addition to recent US chip industry sanctions might have affected their AI/cloud business over there.\n\nThe only reason I have some trepidation about shorting NVDA is that they might come up with a positive guidance for future quarter earnings.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Anyone else got an earnings-related play in mind?\n\nEdit: I forgot that Microsoft reported good revenue in their Azure/cloud business, of which NVDA is a partner. If NVDA is popping off in that sector then maybe investors mig"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 05:36:07'] OP. Being thankful for the little things says a lot about your character. Trying to find light through the darkness is difficult, but it's such a powerful trait.I had a drug problem growing up. I got clean when my kids were born in 2001. I built two businesses and sold them and had more money than I knew what to do with (and had zero skills to manage it). I relapsed in 2005 during a divorce and went to prison in 2008. I lost the last quarter of my 20s, several years of my life, all my money, everyone forgot about me, and I felt like my life was over.I was 31 when I got out, and I had $800 to my name. It took my several years to rebuild, but I did. I not only rebuilt, but I rebuilt to levels well beyond where I was in my 20s. In the end though, what I am grateful for every day is the fact that I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and my freedom.Being grateful for the things you have and learning from mistakes instead of feeling sorry for yourself about the things you've lost is powerful, and a key to future success. I wish you the best of luck, and I am confident with that mentality you will succeed.

There's more satisfaction in this way of understanding life, when your hard work finally gives you reward, you will feel nothing like that feeling. That's true success. Your first million seems lucky, and losing it gambling was unlucky. Time to stop playing with Luck.

Yesterday I was taking a piss, saw it was 2 minutes before close and I bought 1k worth of NVDA puts. It felt so right at the moment my gut told me to inverse myself because it's the stupid thing to do. I hate it here!

It felt really good not having to worry about money.There's another lesson in there. Don't spend like you're a millionaire when it's backed by unrealized gains or volatile equity plays.As your standard of living goes up, you need to factor retaining that into your investment risk profile.

I helped them pay their debts and bills in exchange for letting me stay until I saved up for a house down-payment. I got the boot soon after. If they're great parents, which is why I suspect you're doing this, they'd be happy with a cheaper house somewhere else. Not having to pay a mortgage or rent is a blessing. Your parents want you to succeed. Don't lose hope. You can still do it. You're not at 0.

I know this is WSB, but I'm here for laughing at the insults and people gambling their money like it's free candy, so I'll be saying something controversial:   If you invest in a legit good quality job, every month it's a 100% guaranteed success. It's not a leveraged success, but with proper investment tools, knowledge, and risk management, you'll learn that taking small steps will work wonders, and since the both of us are young and with a decent portfolio, we're already ahead of many. Starting young is the best thing to do imho, with the ways things are going it's better to work hard now and be safe later than worry about not being able to pay the rent or provide food for yourself 5 years from now. Success isn't in the cash, it's in the goals you set for yourself. Focus on those, making sure that it's what makes you happy.

I was using maximum margin ever since I started investing/trading. I'm surprised I didn't get wiped a whole lot earlier. When you use max margin, you are forced to sell at the worst prices, and volatility drag occurs.3. Shorting on max margin. This was pretty fking regarded, but it's what made me most of my money. When you short, you can only make a maximum of 100% but your risks are unlimited. Not an asymmetrical bet you'd want to take often imo.bruh why

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 06:16:20'] The way to make a small fortune is to start with a large one. If you are just a guy playing options on earnings, you have a problem with gambling. The people who do this and are successful or not like you. They have insider information, which is illegal but no one cares, and access to data that you don‚Äôt have the money and resources to acquire. You are going to lose all your money if you keep playing earnings options.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/yihtv4/nvda_might_need_to_recall_their_new_4090_gpus/'
POST_TEXT: b"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.\n\nMore importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.\n\nAnyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.\n\nThoughts?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 11:19:21'] How many 4090s can there be in circulation? Its like 2k per card!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 12:14:13'] Idk‚Ä¶. Those power adapters probably cost Nvidia $10-$15.  If the RC is solely poor manufacturing quality or lower spec‚Äôd components, this would be a relatively cheap issue to resolve.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 18:31:18'] While it‚Äôs an issue, I don‚Äôt think it will hit stock much. It‚Äôs the 4090. Their flagship card that costs what, $2000? There aren‚Äôt that many people using those cards. It‚Äôs not good press, but it‚Äôs not a minority of the cards they sell.It also doesn‚Äôt seem to be a MAJOR liability issue (though this could quickly change). It‚Äôs not like other major PC hardware issues, where there was that story of cases (or was it power supplies?) that literally caught fire, and could catch other things on fire. That is a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. This is just ruining the cards or the connectors or both. But‚Ä¶all it takes is one news story for that to change. So if a news story of one of these cards catching fire breaks, Puts will print. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt see it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 10:56:45'] Problem seems to be the cables. They will probably end up shipping cables if people decide to keep their cards. But they will lose money on returns and will probably have to sell at a lower mark-up. Next 2 quarters will see revenue decline.  With a P/E ratio of 38, you can expect the stock to go down by 50-65% IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 10:42:59'] The GPU bubble was due to being used for bitcoin 'mining'. The reason GPU's were used in the first place is somebody noticed they can do mindless repetitive calculations without expensive CPU's. Last year, using GPU's for bitcoin 'mining' became unprofitable. The way bitcoin 'mining' works is the 'nuggets' get more scarce as more are mined. The GPU initial price plus the electricity and cooling costs were more than the bitcoins mined. All the cryptocurrency 'farms' were switching to banks of ASIC's this year. The GPU consumer market is going to go back to gamers and AI supercomputers. The one growing market is computer graphics requiring CUDA is growing fast in multiple areas beyond digital video studios. Bearish for the short term, wait for the bottom, then buy in. Unreal Engine 5 Raytrace is a mind-blower.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:36:58'] >It is not surprising that the EU would want to break up Google's ad business. Google has been dominant in online advertising for many years, and the EU has been trying to rein in the company's power for some time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 08:10:14'] Google will win the AI biz eventually. And when they do, they have fucked their own ad business model anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:39:25'] AI is going to change the search game. People want answers not web pages. The new ad model will be bribing CHATGPT/BARD to recommend your business. So enjoy the free somewhat objective AI we have now, it's going to become corporate propaganda soon enough. And the typical google search sucks now anyway. Look for a local business you get 3 ads, then 1 or 2 map ads, then organics. Which is all I care about. What actually ranks for a search, not who paid the most. Google got greedy and is hurting their product. Breaking ads away would a) make a hugely profitable company that could be laser focused on improving the search/ad experience and b) let google be the cloud/AI/communications company it is set up to be.

Nothing to see here with Google except a bunch of politicians and attorneys for quite some time.The breakup of the Bell System resulted in the creation of seven independent companies that were formed from the original twenty-two AT&T-controlled members of the System.[5]On January 1, 1984, these companies were NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, Southwestern Bell Corporation, BellSouth, and US West.NYNEX, acquired by Bell Atlantic in 1996, now part of Verizon CommunicationsPacific Telesis, acquired by SBC in 1997, now part of AT&T Inc.Ameritech, acquired by SBC in 1999, now part of AT&T Inc.Bell Atlantic, merged with GTE in 2000 to form Verizon CommunicationsSouthwestern Bell Corporation, rebranded as SBC Communications in 1995, acquired AT&T Corporation in 2005BellSouth, acquired by AT&T Inc. in 2006US West, acquired by Qwest in 2000, which in turn was acquired by CenturyLink in 2011

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 03:48:23'] In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. The reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. However, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. The entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. Almost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. So there are two big points to make here. 1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. 2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. Nvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. Tesla at 64Microsoft at 36Apple at 30Google at 28 So you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't. We are in the fomo greed cycle at the very end before a big hit. Stay cash and get ready to play the ups and downs for the next year.

If the vote passes stocks go up if the vote doesnt pass stocks will go down because everyone is going to sell their bets. \n\nNancis husband has already bought a ton of NVDA stock. That means that the vote will most likely pass. \n\nNow this is some crystal clear shit. Any boomer looking at the news can see this this trade which means that we will probably see a gap up on Monday for NVDA. \n\nHowever a lot of traders especially retirement fund institutions will probably wait until the vote comes through to buy into this stock which means that we arent technically too late to the party. \n\nSo my question is whats the move on Monday. Do I keep it basic and buy shares. Full send with some OTM calls. Keep it lax with ATM calls or keep is conservative with some 2 month out debit spreads ?'

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 15:11:00'] Nvda isn't looking great in the short term.The crypto crash is seeing bulk liquidations of mining gpus, crashing the prices. The board makers have huge inventories and basically said "were not making your new cards until our old ones are gone." threats did not work. Heavy discounts are likely and nvidia will likely have to wear a lot of it. They locked in a bunch of tsmc fab time/units they asked nicely not to use/pay for and tsmc said "ok find someone to buy it from you and we'll talk". So in the near future, the last 2 years of sales to miners, a market that has gone into liquidation, will see the new products competing with a flood of heavily discounted old stock. The lower end chips will be a hard sell. Why buy a 4060 when a 3080 is cheaper and faster? This happened last time. And the time before that. In semiconductors every boom is followed by a bust and every shortage is followed by a glut. Nvidia won't go bankrupt, but several smaller semis will.Nvidia will just have a lean couple of years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 19:26:30'] I've been financially savvy since before my birth. My mother did not have insurance to cover childbirth so I contrived a circumstance that would require a caesarean section rather than vaginal birth in order to make the medical procedure covered by her provider. To do so I had to choke myself with the umbilical cord but not enough to kill me, only enough to restrict the blood flow enough to the point that I would be regarded enough to use WSB.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 19:50:00'] WSB is so powerful that in 7 years time the word "regarded" will be considered a slur. I'm proud to be regarded with you all because some of you are medically regarded, based on your trading history.

All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself; no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing." - Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States of America, _before Congress, March 14, 2023._

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 04:09:24'] Is it wrong thinking that the introduction of Daily 0DTE options had a substantial effect on the market?It's hard to know because I don't know how much money is getting burnt every day, but it could theoretically result in less directional intraday, and I feel that it certainly has - every intraday dump bounces and every rally falters like fucking clockwork.The question is if this has a stabilizing effect that prevents violent crashes or insane rallies, or if it simply builds tension that eventually has to pop.Then again, maybe it's a fucking drop of piss in the ocean and has no significant effect at all - fuck do I know.

I might just move all my money into index funds because after seeing that I could not bear to lose all my money in options and be in a situation where  I‚Äôm forced to go to places like that to eat. I just can‚Äôt do it. This is a wake up call

POST_TEXT: b"I believe this quarter will be a huge revenue miss for $nvda due to softening pc demand and a crashing GPU demand (merge and dumping of gpu mining equipment on the market). Nvda is also currently trading at much higher multiples respect to AMD even though are projected to have a similar growth in the years  ahead. It's either amd undervalued or it's nvidia overvalued? Given the current market sentiment i think it's the latter. \n\nIf the market rebounds from this current low i intend to buy some november put at $100\nChange my mind."

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 09:59:39'] I bought into the $SPCE hype which I believe was about 3 months or so prior to covid. Got in at around $30 and went up hardly at all but sunk pretty badly as everything else did at the beginning of the pandemic. Then it shot up again, then down again and then up again but I felt so uneasy about the company that I was lucky enough to sell about 10 months after at the exact price I bought it for. Today it's down  to $3.40 a share which would be really really shitty if I never got rid of it. Dodged a dick lookin spaceship on that one.$PINS and $WISH were the other hypes I bought into but Id rather not get into those ones üòÇ

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 09:15:15'] AMC volume is about 50% more than its average at this time of the day. Lots of large green volume candles on the chart. This is probably a 20% day, a more realistic figure than the one I posted earlier which was 30%.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 12:36:52'] Don't be happy guys. We need another 3 days like today. Last couple weeks we lost a lot of blood. This is only a small recover. Game is not over untill we say we are done. Revenge will be ruthless. What i say only applies to AMC and GME. I don't care about NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:57:05'] Hey guys, I've a new product called AI Coin. It's amazing. PM me for more details.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:46:45'] Yeah, you remember that asset bubble that never went anywhere, the Internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:48:38'] AI isn't a bubble, and ChatGPT/Generative AI are not all of AI.  Machine learning is a key component across a multitude of industries that's been growing for years.It's a *buzzword* right now, but it's no more of a bubble than cloud computing or ARM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:13:25'] It's not a bubble until IPO's start. Then we will see some crazy shit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:02:36'] This is the dumbest chart I‚Äôve ever seen on WSB and that‚Äôs saying something.The ‚ÄúAI‚Äù trend includes just two companies, and it‚Äôs compared with:-two countries and a full continent (that includes those countries)-an entire bubble for a prior tech that likely includes ALL companies classified as ‚Äúinternet‚Äù -ARKK??-FAANG‚Ä¶ wat why-oh yeah and gold back in the 70sPuts on these regards at BofA
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 08:07:21'] The difference is that the companies investing in AI capabilities are already the biggest and most valuable on the planet.See how the FAANG and AI line move in lockstep?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:50:43'] Ah yes, the Internet and Housing bubbles - glad those ended /s
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:12:01'] You're right, the chart does show that AI is in a bit of a "bubble" right now. However, I believe that this bubble will continue to grow for some time before it bursts. This is because there is still so much potential for growth in the field of AI and we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of what this technology can do. So while it may be risky to invest in AI stocks at the moment, I think there is still good potential for profit if you pick your investments carefully.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:12:46'] Please explain the y axis.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 09:05:11'] Also its everywhere on the news that people who use technology follow.My parents haven't heard anything about language models or chat gpt or machine learning. And its been in my feed for 3 years now.This is still the stealth phase...Problem wont see the start of the hype phase until next year at the earliest. Thats when deepfake is going to be relevant in major political campaigns. The fun part is every major company is going to want their own AI and right now the major leading group is open source. Which means the companies will be able to build their own off the backs of it.So its not about whos the best AI company. It's gonna be about who was able to adopt AI without making a mess of their systems. And that could be anyone from at&t to automating customer service or cheesecake factory using AI to generate new recipes or meal ideas based on whats popular.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:21:01'] I'm sure AI will be huge but the problem is picking the winners.

Those few companies might be good investments, but how to determine which ones they are is the difficult part.

There‚Äôs a conscious recognition that generative ai is marketing mumbo jumbo. Kinda like data mining was a few years back. Great in theory but much harder in practice.A true bubble is where people really buy in hook line and sinker on an idea and requires a certain level of ignorance. People are too well informed on this mostly because it‚Äôs fairly obvious that there is still little practical application in day to day life. Compare that to the dot com or real estate bubbles where people really truly believed the sky was the limit.This period feels very similar to the run up in 2017 into the correction around the Super Bowl in 2018. I suspect we have a few more months of upside followed by a steep correction.

If you didn't listen to the earnings call, you can absolutely hear the fear in their voices. That bullshit about not knowing how many GPUs are being used for mining vs gaming is a lie. GPUs used for gaming require gaming drivers. These drivers have to be updated. GPUs sold - Drivers = Mining GPUs. While this may not be dead balls accurate, it is accurate enough to know whether you have a problem or not. They have that data, they just won't share it. Nvidia has problems that they are not being transparent about. Their flagship GPU is selling for 50% of MSRP and its replacement will require a 1200 watt power supply and likely have a $2500-$3000 MSRP, maybe more.  While I do not think that Nvidia is going to collapse, I do think we will see two more quarters of fucked up earnings calls. Nvidia is a $150 stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:08:29'] You have a 50/50 shot of being correct but a 90% chance you'll choose incorrectly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:04:38'] Can‚Äôt happen twice. Buy nvda Edit: lightning does strike twice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 17:28:39'] Did you just say NVDA and PUTS in the same sentence?  Nice knowing you
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:20:11'] OP, exact same here. 75c RBLX that'll get killed tomorrow. About to lose 8k, half my portfolioI even considered selling before close to buy airbnb calls ROFLAnyway, I bought NVDA calls. But imma sell them and then have no position tomorrow, so you can't inverse me jajajajaja
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:57:27'] I'm always wrong, but I can't see how Nvidia doesn't beat. They can't make enough product to satisfy demand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:03:29'] I hope your all doing puts as that will mean it's gonna explode up :)
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 18:07:52'] My experience with nvda last earnings, whatever optimistic estimate already priced in. I believe NVDA gona have a blow earning all expectations off the roof. But Incase it just sort of just beat expectations, I'll buy putEdit: this is not a financial advice, 80% of my earnings play result were complete loss, 20% was sort of loss
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 19:37:39'] Seen the insane GPU prices and no inventory for the last 1.5 years?  NVDA figured out the unlimited cash glitch...
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 17:06:22'] Sold today, not worth holding through earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:15:17'] Their earnings are tomorrow and they'll probably beat expectations, so buy PUTS so you can watch your wallet cry üëçBut in all seriousness, I think it can help if you check out the chart and see if it gives you a good opportunity for a bounce tomorrow. Or, if you can day trade, go with the momentum first, then consider swinging. Check around 30 min after market opens and wait for a Hammer (bullish), Rejection of a good resistance level (bearish), or wedges. Remember to use QQQ for reference I mostly missed it today, but if you check QQQ around 10:01 AM (or 7:01 if you live in the west coast like me), QQQ began creating a falling wedge pattern. The hammer candle followed by the green candle at 10:27, and then the breakout of the wedge was super bullish. Most of my funds didn't clear, but I got a super cheap contract and still made around 120% profit.___Tomorrow, look for premarket levels, chart them on tradingview or webull, and just watch for what happens. The goal is to daytrade the momentum first, then if you want to take a chance, try swinging a contract or open up a straddle/strangleI want to swing a call, but... Well, I got burned on Tesla earnings pretty badly, so I'm not very confident in what the outcome will beSorry for the long explanation, but Godspeed üëç

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 17:55:45'] NVDA will beat the highest whisper number by a mile but warn that "supply chain constraints" going forward will suck ass, yada yada yada. The only thing that might save your bacon is if they announce that they're going to use the ARM buyout money to buy back $20+B of NVDA stock.I read someone else make that claim here on WSB this morning and I completely agree.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 19:39:04'] They will crush earnings, and guide up, that‚Äôs the only sure thing. Issue is, they‚Äôve been doing that for 7 years now, so tough to say.IMO the play is other undervalued semi‚Äôs that might rally on the news. I like HIMX and MU calls, as both could rally on the news.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 19:46:09'] The real play was buying in [during fridays dip](https://i.imgur.com/ltF8lbC.png). Only regret was not having had more cash available to buy more than 1.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 15:12:11'] I play ER only until before market closes, small gains are better than loss
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 16:02:29'] Nvidia will miss the earnings for one simple reason. They can't make enough chips due silicon shortages across the entire chain. Its not just Nvidia its everyone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 20:41:56'] My gut says calls. Like NVDA has to crush earnings just like how AMD did right? Ok so now go get puts and report back

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 19:38:01'] you need reasons to buy in whichever direction.... i use personal reasons, observations made in my own life. i bought fb puts because i found myself watching huge interviews with the whistleblower like on 60 minutes which i watch often. watched many of my friends leave in droves, the social dilemma doc, more negative sentiment, etc.i bought nvda calls because every day, in every random corner of the internet i visit, i see someone else discussing how they are just now getting into mining crypto. still. also because i use blender 3d and can tell from my 4 y.o build that the new version of blender would work best with new generations of cpus (eg, AM4 sockets for amd chips, etc) but especially gpus. newest gtx/rtx gpus are being recommended in blender communities left and right. blender 3.0 came out in december. there has been explosions in tutorials on youtube. etc.i could be wrong, i'd never sit here and act like i know the future. only thing i know is my gut feelings, and also when i'm wrong i don't kick myself. don't base trades solely off what others say, that's a surefire way to blow up your account. make your own observations and choices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 18:04:39'] I have been watching the top S&P 500 holding ERs, it seems like if it‚Äôs up 2-3 days prior to ER then it will drop and if it‚Äôs down prior to ER then it goes up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 22:17:26'] Tbh it jumped yesterday.... might be priced in already.But it'd be odd for Apple, AMD, and MS to make earnings only for Nvidia to lose.My tip if you're skittishly bullish and and 27k on hand is to sell a just ITM option so you can just walk away with 1k if it goes up or trades sideways.  Covers 10 bucks worth of losses.

During High volatility like today I close my long call  leaps to collect some $$$ due to inflated price action on the options and sell some CSP to collect some juicy premium. If it goes up I keep the premium and buy my leaps again once implied volatility is back to normal. if NVIDIA drops I keep my premium get assigned and sell .30 delta CC and don't wheel. if assigned on my CC I keep the premium and buy my leaps again. seems to work for me ;)

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 08:07:55'] No...because it's not a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 14:14:48'] 40% discount is only legit if the last peak was a warranted valuation.  Frankly it was overvalued at the last peak.  Is it a great company? Yes.  But everything has its price.  Consumer recession means they can't afford $1.5k graphics cards anymore.  Higher electricity prices means higher crypto mining costs, along with lower crypto prices, means lower GPU demand.  The only long term driver is hyperspace AI server growth, but no one actually can predict those upgrade cycles across the industry.  Wait for NVDA to fall further, buy at the 600 week MA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 08:41:46'] Good luck "Innovating" yourself to 20% growth for the next 10 years when you are as big as NVDA because that's what you'll need to beat the s&p. Even after the stock has been cut in half, it is still priced for perfection. one slip-up and you are fucked
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 10:18:43'] i got in at $167. if it drops below that im buying more. either way i love what theyre doing and think its a great long term hold in my humble opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 08:45:43'] The crypto bump they were getting is fading fast and once it's gone it's not coming back.  Card sales will stay very strong for quite awhile but margin per card is going to be a hell of a lot more reasonable.  Nvda is basically going through reevaluation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 23:30:39'] Where will all this money come from for business to increase revenue? Lmao. AI is going to help businesses decrease costs. No way it's going to increase their revenue. Only stocks that will truly benefit is those that are the chips, data centers etc. One day it will all come crashing down

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:30:28'] AI can‚Äôt create new information at this point in time. All it can do is take in, sort and reorganize information. That reorganization appears as ‚Äúnew‚Äù to some people but it is in fact not new, just reorganized. Believing that an AI can create anything new is a suckers bet at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:37:30'] Not sure what's more regarded, OP or me agreeing with everything OP said

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 04:33:33'] What OP fails to realize is that AI is just one facet of the boom we‚Äôre about to see. We also have robotics, quantum computers, medical advancements, and space travel. About to see the roaring 20s on cocaine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:30:46'] Also, OP is a complete dunce who doesn't understand that there is no intelligence in "AI", just like there's no intelligence in OP's incoherent rambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 12:14:06'] It‚Äôs not 0 cost information generation it‚Äôs 0 cost information transformation, which is what most knowledge work is currently. Take this financial data and turn it into a power point so executives can understand it. Take this purchase data and tell us what types of products we should be making. All knowledge work is just reformatting data, and it‚Äôs what ai is really good at.The switch from prescriptive programming to declarative programming has been happening for a while and GPT‚Äôs are just another step in that direction.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:21:00'] I agree with you in that AI could seriously save our asses. It really is a transformation of everything and people underestimate your zero marginal cost points. That‚Äôs fuckin huge and will absolutely change the world.Value can be somewhat abstract and our previous ideas about what value is and means will be jumbled up into a mishmash with no clear outline for at least 12 months as you say. Productivity will increase magnitudes. How that exactly plays out will be interesting. The companies that adopt it early will save untold mountains of money by streamlining this tech into their giant machines.Shit is going to get wild. üçª

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:27:13'] OP is highly regarded among apes. We are definitely in the "Complacency" stage and when you look at the body of evidence, the probability is higher that we drill down rather than melt up. Too much liquidity in the market still so the party continues. "AI" is the next bubble and although apes say it's a "mini bubble", I disagree. Past few weeks have demonstrated full on FOMO into "AI" euphoria. Climax was yesterday with tons of profit taking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 12:11:34'] The future of AI is cloud based, not mainframe based. Meaning, the top 2-4 cloud providers will provide you with the hardware grunt to run whatever model you want.I don't see nvda selling chips to corporations worldwide, it will quickly become obvious the upfront cost is too big for each individual company to invest in and quickly move to ai-as a service, just as storage is done nowadays.And cloud providers will not be buying nvda hardware, but will instead develop their own dedicated chips, just as Amazon and Google have already announced.. There may be some big orders to get in the game right now, but over a year or so they will develop their own solutions in house due to the extreme costs.Just my take on it. I see the nvda benefit short lived unless they can start selling that stuff to consumers, which will cannibalize their gpu segment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 10:42:54'] When the reckoning comes, as it always does, hundreds of shit-tier companies will go straight to zero in a matter of days. The gamblers will lose all their money on whatever penny stock BioPharma-AI Ltd they thought was going to be their thousands-bagger. AAPL will "plummet" by 20%. The S&P will lose 40%.A few months later, the survivors will buy everything everywhere for pennies, open innovative new depts to fill the gaping holes in the economy, strike new ATHs, hire bored geniuses with SBC, and the only loser investors left will be the paperhanded folks who sold and shorted everything at the bottom.  üåà The Economic Cycle üåà  Still sounds like a bull case to me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 09:50:44'] People tend to forget, the largest part of the market is not "retail" (us in WSB, etc..). It's huge funds, and every two weeks an enormous chunk of money gets thrown into the market as a whole via 401K's, 403B's (and similar). As a whole, that money goes into large funds which in turn buy baskets of stocks...regardless of their intrinsic value. It's one of the things that has created this whole weird & crazy market (not based on reality nor fundamentals) for quite some years now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 09:13:20'] Sorry about your puts. Not sure which ‚Äúprofitless shitcos‚Äù you think are propping up this market, because the earnings reports for most large companies have been pretty solid. Being long on the American economy is the most sane, and measured stance an investor can take. Will there inevitably be pullback? No shit. But I guarantee you that not soon after the market will reach another ATH. Is Nvidia overvalued? Does the Tinman have a sheet metal cock?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 09:24:07'] ‚ÄúImagine for a moment that you decided to invest money now and you bought a farm,‚Äù said Buffett, the chairman and CEO Berkshire Hathaway. ‚ÄúLet's say you bought 160 acres...and the farmer next to you had 160 identical acres, same contour, same soil quality.‚ÄùNow, imagine that the farmer who has the same farm as yours makes you an offer every day to either sell his farm to you or buy yours, he continued.‚ÄúThat's a very obliging neighbor,‚Äù Buffett said.This pricing advantage is something you don‚Äôt get with farms, but you get with stocks, according to Buffett.Buying stocks ‚Äî like buying a farm ‚Äî means you‚Äôre buying into a business. But with stocks, you have an added advantage of having that neighbor ‚Äî or other investors ‚Äî giving you a price for your farm every day.‚ÄúThe only thing you have to do is remember that this guy next door is there to serve you and not to instruct you,‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúYou bought the farm because you thought the farm had the potential. You don‚Äôt need a quote on it.‚ÄùIf the neighbors offer is lower today than it was yesterday, you still have the same farm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 12:33:00'] We are already in a recession. The markets have dropped 30 to 40% and have not retaken highs for like 18 months. If you are holding on to cash waiting for a market collapse you are playing the game wrong. The average recovery time is like 2 to 3 years. After 2008 collapse, it took 6 years to recover the high. If you kept investing consistently, you'd have gotten an annual 10-12% return. The dumb fucks holding money in high yield savings waiting for the perfect moment aren't even beating inflation and they have to pay regular income tax on the interest.Nvidia is also a fantastic company whose tech will power AI compute for MSFT and AMZN in the cloud. They also will supply gpus for vehicles, warehouses, androids, large drones, and more. They are shifting manufacturing more to US soil to secure long term business stability away from China as well. They are thinking very far ahead. In the last twelve months, it dropped 70% value and then 3x'd again because crypto and block chain tech fumbled hard, but AI was strong. They've been working toward AI, building AI models, and computer vision for years. It's not new.Oh and fuck your puts. I hope the market goes against you. I love my monopoly money economy.

An obvious and immediate counterpoint is that if the broader market is feeling the pain and being propped up by the big names in the indices, then valuations for the broader market are more or less returning to normal and thus will eventually leave room for growth. Even though the ratio is a little *more* top heavy now, it's been top-heavy throughout the post-2008, pre-COVID bull run.

It‚Äôs a box full of processed carbs in small chunks, not one full of an old mustachioed man in a blue pirate uniform, and yet millions of people find some kind of meaningful connection between the two.Stock prices go up and down to transfer wealth, be it in the form of cash or securities, from retail investors to criminal institutions. It‚Äôs either that, or else you believe that the valuations of companies worth as much ten digits can change intrinsic valuations by an order of magnitude either way in less than a year, or else there are exactly zero people out there who have the ability to value the underlying business of any publicly-traded stock. Nobody knows what any stock is worth because the value of a stock isn‚Äôt based on anything other than the colliding whims of humans relatively weighted by their respective wealth and power.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 21:01:18'] Let me clarify a few things.  Heading into 2023 the bull case = earnings will exceed estimates and stocks outperform, base case= earnings meet or modestly undershoot estimates stock remains range bound and bear case= earnings estimates undershoot estimates massively and stocks re-rate with a lower multiple.  Through q1 bull case played out to a T.  And if you look at earnings estimates across the board for 2024, base case estimates are for earnings to be up 15% vs 2023.  Stocks will front run this by 6-9 months and the bear case has imploded due to earnings coming in much stronger than expected and avoiding the dreaded double dip.  Tech stocks driving the markets is not a new narrative and 70% of s and p 500 return over last 10 years is from less than 10 stocks.  So this isn‚Äôt new, it isn‚Äôt abnormal and due to market cap weighting stronger earnings from megacap tech has an outsized impact on overall s and p 500 earnings.  So your point about lack of breadth is really it relevant in the context of the market.  Buybacks from big cap, Google, meta, apple and Microsoft also create a strong buoy of buying pressure that is limiting volatility and create a low volume rally year to date.  As it relates to interest rates, you don‚Äôt really understand what rates the market is focused on when determining equity risk premium, aka premium stocks trade to bond vs cash.  That multiple is driven by interest rates but also by earnings growth not just trailing multiples and if you look at longer term rates ten year, 30 year, they are off from high at 4.4% to 3.5% currently and 4.3% to 3.8%.  The myopic view you are looking at is the remedial optic someone who isn‚Äôt in the business looks at which is fed funds rate.  We have an inverted yield curve and longer term rates peaked last fall and heading lower as inflation forecasts continue to weaken in tandem with macro economic weakness being priced in to future cuts in fed funds rate.  Market is front running this, and stocks aren‚Äôt expensive, they are very reasonably priced and will re-rate higher as we head into a cutting and easing cycle.  Rookie evaluation candidly on your end.  And FYI exec on us wealth management strategy and consulting team for a bulge bracket big 6.  Stick to your day job.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 04:12:37'] Bro, pull up the chart for the S&P 500 and zoom out as far as possible. How many times do you think people said the exact same thing you are saying now? Probably every damn year for the past 50 years. A stock‚Äôs price is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Right now folks are willing to pay more for NVDA than BRK.A. People are more interested in investing in the future than in the past. Simple as that. Opinions might change and NVDA could drop, but it might not and at the moment it‚Äôs way sexier than BRK. P/E ratios have nothing to do with it.

I give two shits about the manufacturer, so long as it‚Äôs one of the big names that‚Äôs somewhat trustworthy.Did I mention the merge? Puts on this sucker, gonna have dramatically reduced revenue over the next 2 years with the China block, the merge, and a softening consumer market due to economic slowdown.P.S. Ethereum mining is no longer a thing. ETH is no longer mined. ETH is now unlocked over time, by holding existing ETH. (Basically ETH now pays interest, and that‚Äôs how all future tokens will be unlocked.)Don‚Äôt get me fucking started about how a huge chunk of the worlds energy is spent mining digital gold that some fucktard convinced the world was actually real. Staking is the only way this should have ever worked, and is the only way it will work going forward for new protocols and tokens.

I'd trust a mainstream commercial airliner or a military jet, but I'm keeping my distance from private stuff. https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/04/us/southwest-virginia-aircraft-crash/index.htmlThe same goes for medical care. I don't want a distinguished private practice surgeon. I want a team of attendings, fellows, residents, and medical students at an academic medical center where they ask me the same annoying questions over and over again.

POST_TEXT: b'This might be considered insider information, but ill post it anyways. Six months ago I purchased a gpu, which means nvda sales went up by the amount i purchased the gpu. That means that the sales will be higher then when I would not have bought the gpu. Now people dont know i bought the gpu before this post, so the sales will be higher, and the revenue will be higher then when i did not buy the gpu. Hence, the stock will go up after earnings report cause i bought said gpu. \n\nTLDR: I bought rx 6700 gpu so i think stock will go up. Trust me.'

Double downTriple down(My favorite part) Didn‚Äôt know how to upload an image to Reddit so he had to ask Reddit instead of GoogleMade 200k but was so greedy even after Reddit told him to sell that he kept it (keep in mind he‚Äôs using Robinhood, the last broker I would want to deal with during bankruptcy)FRC is bailed out, FDIC approves JPMorgan takeover of FRC and all future expiring options of FRC deemed worthless (as stated in the option agreement)He‚Äôs out all his money and wants to sue‚Ä¶ Robinhood lolClassic WSB story in the making

The risk to reward is just absolutely insane

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 11:02:59'] You should sell now. Most of NVDAs GPU sales were based on BTC mining rigs. They even admitted to it later on. Rising interest rates lowers BTC price due to it takes USD money supply out of the system and thus a stronger dollar. BTC miners get squeezed and then sell their GPUs in the secondary used markets. This brings the price of new sales down. Just take a look at eBay, prices are collapsing well below the MSRP retail price tag.
