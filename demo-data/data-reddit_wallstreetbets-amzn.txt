	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:55:36'] I wouldn't be surprised if it's just to be listed as buyer for some index reports. Like they just list if large shareholders bought or sold shares during a period. Buying a share makes amazon green instead of grey or red.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:57:43'] What a stud, I wish I had that kind of money to put into AMZN
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:03:42'] There‚Äôs going to be 10 articles from every news site on this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:13:58'] CFO sure doesn't have a lot of confidence

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:42:57'] Maybe it's a residual fractional reinvestment. They accue fractional share options along with their regular shares and then can buy them once the create a whole unit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:44:11'] Where to find him buying stocks??

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:49:23'] It's a hidden message!He has 990,545,661 total shares. It's a composite number, so it's not referring to Amazon *prime*. So what are its factors?1x3x3x7x1913x8219Look at the first 4 factors: **1, 3, 3, 7**. He's telling us he's one of the elite!**1913** was the year before the first world war broke out.8219 has a digit sum of 20, a digital root of 2, and a length of 4. **2024**!World War confirmed next year.**Calls on $AMZN and $LMT for drone warfare.**

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:19:36'] He believes in this company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:41:07'] The stock split was part of his plan to finally afford a whole share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:52:48'] He probably has some contract stipulation that he has to purchase stock or lose his price/discount on stock options so he can buy a single share to extend the terms of his vested options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:56:41'] At 420 lol this is probably a code for situation 69

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 04:58:24'] Must be the one I sold.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 05:56:31'] I genuinely do think this is a message for people from Jeffy B that he thinks AMZN is a fantastic buy right here
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:06:43'] Hope he doesn't pay too much tax on gains of 1 share.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:36:10'] In all seriousness, why would he buy just one share?From which app/website is this screenshot taken?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:12:53'] I love how the CEO of their most profitable business (AWS) has the least Amazon shares amongst the five insiders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:43:35'] Fuck it, going to take it as a sign and jump aboard üòÇü´°

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:36:46'] Clearly just cutting his cost per share and averaging down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:40:42'] His plan is to buy one share a year in order to dodge any insider trading charges.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:43:32'] Divorce has been rough
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:43:08'] Fat finger trade!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 06:50:21'] he's trying to dollar cost average but not very well
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:58:28'] This bitch üòÇ
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 00:12:10'] His assistant didn't hear the million part when he told her
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 05:19:20'] The cfo having 50k shares should tell you something.. everyone else is holding a bag of dicks‚Ä¶.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:52:42'] It looks like Amazon execs have been busy insider trading again. On May 25, Jeff Bezos bought 114.77 shares at a cost of $1 per share.

Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 11:00:22'] >The Amazon earnings report is due out today after the closing bell, and I am expecting strong results. The company has a history of beating Wall Street's expectations, and I believe they will do so again today. However, there are some potential challenges that could impact the stock price, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Overall, I think the stock is a good buy at current levels and expect it to produce strong returns in the next 12-18 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 19:40:46'] The biggest warning sign with this company is that Michael Griffin, former head of NASA and a director on their board, sold his entire stake in the company back in December. It was 1.8M shares so not a small amount. It's entirely possible he is the biggest moron ever. He wasn't one of NASA's best administrators. It seems more likely though, that he knows this company is going nowhere and he wanted to cash out before the share price drops any further. I wish you luck though.

The fact that Kuiper (a mega constellation) is going to need a new factory worth of reaction wheels isn't surprising. I guess there is no better place to announce it than the biggest space conference.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:11:36'] How does this help the SP? They've already announced the deal and the fact that thousands of reaction wheels will be sold as part of that. That revenue should be priced in. The specific partner involved doesn't seem like it should matter all that much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 23:56:38'] I‚Äôm expecting growth stocks to all reprice to the downside with the imminent recession, which would lead to a better opportunity to buy leap calls on the rocketlab. As the market corrects 5-10%. Growth should drop +30%. Rocketlab would be $2.5-$3.That would be the best risk to reward opportunity.Since we don‚Äôt know when the announcement will be and there are storm clouds on the horizon for the growth industry with interest rate headwinds, it‚Äôs not best to buy call options right now. Shares would be safe but the opportunity cost associated with them are not appealing enough for me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 06:35:47'] This doesn't add up. Project Kuiper is a ~10 billion dollar project from Google, and just looking at how much reaction wheels cost as a % of a satellite, it's about 1-2% of the total weight of the sat. SpaceXs sats are like 10-100k each, and even if they were a million Rocketlab isn't getting a billion dollars from Kuiper, which as you pointed correct wants ~3k sats in total. It sounds like this is a good deal for rocketlab, but you're wrong on how big of an idea it is

POST_TEXT: b"Sup fellow degenerates, gather 'round and let me tell you the tale of how I banked a sweet $12k on $AMZN shares while the rest of you paper-handed fools prob lost stacks or broke even at best. So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.\n\nIt was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.\n\nWhy, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos baby.\n\nSo, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $M"

POST_TEXT: b'Ive been almost fully invested in Amazon for over a year now. I originally bought really high at around 150 before the entire market decided to crash. When it did, I took the opportunity to buy more and so now my avg cost is down to 102. Currently holding about 150 shares.\n\nI want to try and gauge market sentiment on Amazon here by seeing what you all think. Is it going to continue flat around $100? Is it going to surge tomorrow? I have definitely noticed a trend for the last few weeks or even months that it tends to spike up on Wednesday and Thursdays most often. It seems like there is a lot of resistance, presumably from people who dont fully understand the breadth of Amazons offerings, their leading position in ALL retail segments, and the insane investments in automation they have been/are making.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:16:54'] Amazon added 750k workers, out of which about 150k were white collar workers, in 2 years and opened a whole lot of fulfillment facilities. This is a huge drag on their cash flows. They need to cut way more than the 27k they announced to turn things around on cash flow basis. Unless they take steps in that direction or announce new lines of revenue I do not see it turning around. So you might see it in the 90 to 100 zone for some time. If you are in it for the short term, try and exit at close to 110.

They decide to invest the majority into gender and cultural studies, which there is nothing wrong with that but the staff (10) they hired make easily $170k per person, and no one has seen them available. They make more than the typical professor of psychology or biology. Also, they supposedly had grants but no one has received one as far as I know. Wonder where the rest of it went.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 07:07:46'] it seems like Amazon is the company behind the undisclosed deal with Rocketlab. The Amazon project Kuipar, a huge satellite fleet, is potentially worth billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years. Adam Spice, Rocketlab CFO, attended an event and did a presentation, answering questions regarding the new reaction wheels. He gave away too much information and the information seems to point to Amazon's project Kuipar.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 22:24:05'] Dude. If you were an expert in this field you‚Äôd know a few things:1.	It‚Äôs fucking spelled ‚ÄúKuiper‚Äù not ‚ÄúKuipar‚Äù2.	Kuiper is a long ways away from even launching those 600kg satellites. They‚Äôre launching two small test satellites at the end of the year. Launching the bigger satellites is sometime in 2024 - at best. 3.	most importantly - Kuiper is building their reaction wheels in house. Kuiper is notorious for wanting to control their components. On the last item, here‚Äôs a quote from the Head of Kuiper- >	‚ÄúAffordability is Job One for us,‚Äù said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really important for us to keep that cost low, because if we don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very difficult to get the unserved and underserved connected to our service. So we took on the challenge to design our satellites two orders of magnitude cheaper.‚Äù>	There are no glimpses, however, at the satellites themselves. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre designing the solar arrays, we‚Äôre designing the reaction wheels,‚Äù Badyal said.A $100k reaction wheel is fucking expensive and can definitely be made cheaper.Edit: this is either an obvious P&D or OP has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. My comment got downvoted seconds after I posted it. Someone didn‚Äôt like the factual information.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 17:30:37'] So you bought the 95 strike long calls when Amazon was somewhere between 99-101?

I think your best hope is Amazon dumping about 4 bucks a share tomorrow so you can buy back those short calls.  Of course, I have to bet against you a bit cause I have $60 long calls at the same exp.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:51:37'] Amazon.com, Inc.

The company's P/S ratio of 513x and P/E ratio of n/a further indicates that AMZN stock may be overpriced at its current level
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:44:14'] They spent way too much on people and infrastructure during covid.  Granted some was to meet unprecedented demand but you have to wonder why nobody questioned whether or not conditions were temporary or the new norm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:58:14'] Amazon is having a real shit time trying to transition from growth to value. The kinda peaked and now are losing customers due to third party seller shenanigans, increased competition, and a string of ventures that just haven't paid off. Not to mention labor issues, regulatory scrutiny, and a bitch of a COVID hangover.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 14:56:48'] Amazon's stock will trade flat unless they split the company up into separate business units.  They have built many business units that continuously lose money (like grocery) or that failed entirely (like healthcare).  Their retail business has no logical curation and is overwhelmed with Chinese companies selling low-quality goods, resulting in Amazon.com becoming a digital flee market with a home page filled with inaccurate recommendations.  These same 3rd party sellers are upset because Amazon is raising fees, taking over 50% of an item price to pay for logistics & delivery.  Meanwhile Walmart & Target now offer fast delivery with no membership required.  Anyone who is still bullish on Amazon is ignoring all of the problems they need to fix to keep growing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:00:42'] I was under the impression this deal was more about the real estate and facilities.They wanted in on the grocery delivery business and purchasing an established chain is a lot easier than building X amount of brick and mortar locations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:51:52'] I worked at whole foods for 3 years when I was in school. In my opinion, yes, it is expensive. However, there are certain items that are 100% worth purchasing at WF vs. another grocery store. I buy most of my seafood and meat there, like salmon, beef, chicken. After working behind the meat counter for 2 years I really do believe they sell a sustainably sourced, ethically raised, and better quality product than other supermarkets. That being said, don‚Äôt buy everything there. You‚Äôre buying the same milk, produce, bread, and eggs there for ~20% more than another grocery store, for basically no improvement in quality. They also sell certain speciality items like fancy cheese and coffee brands that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere. Overall there are things worth buying there, but don‚Äôt do your whole grocery trip at WF.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:24:51'] Whole foods is nice to shop at because no one is there and it's quiet. I mean the prices are not great and they have most of the same produce and other products other stores do but at least it's quiet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:13:27'] >It is clear that the Amazon-Whole Foods deal has not been as transformational as it was made out to be. However, I believe that this is due to the fact that Amazon is still in the process of digesting Whole Foods. Once they have fully digested Whole Foods, we will see a more transformed company emerge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:52:04'] I really think competitive supermarkets have upped their healthy food game‚Ä¶And, kept prices lower than Whole Paycheck‚Ä¶Not that beating Whole Paycheck on price is that hard.I really thought Amazon was gonna radically lower Whole Foods prices‚Ä¶to kill off the competition‚Ä¶but, they never did.Amazon definitely hasn‚Äôt maximized this acquisition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:30:47'] I think it worked out great for Amazon. They don't give a shit about Whole Foods, but they get to use every Whole Foods store to test out their automated buying service, which they'll they start selling to other stores. All your data will go through AWS and they'll be able to recommend you products on Amazon that go with the stuff you bought in store. And I'm certain they do some eye tracking stuff to see where you stopped and paused in the store, to know what your interested in even if you didn't buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:48:53'] Less of a variety of products all the time, WFs seems to be replacing everything they can with their 365 brand. Most cashiers replaced with self-service checkout stations. I hate giving money to Amazon but in my area, all the food co-ops are gone and there aren't many alternatives for certain products.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:29:53'] I was  Whole Foods customer for many years and since it was acquired by Amazon it has been nothing but a constant disappointment. Not the pl e I use to love.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:57:33'] The quality of my local whole food dropped immediately after Amazon bought them
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:00:25'] I was worried that Amazon would tinker with the high prices by cheaping out on quality. I shop at Whole Paycheque for certain items precisely because of the quality. However, there is one item whose quality has gone down. The pizzas used to be sooo good. Had one recently and the dough was terrible. I since have asked an employee what was up with the dough and he said they no longer make it but get pre-made dough in big boxes. So no more pizza :(
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:27:29'] I drop off my returns there all the time
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:38:37'] Lol what's with the paid comments buffing off Whole Foods?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:51:12'] Amazon killed the Wholefoods culture. My wife worked at Wholefoods for 20 years, started as a part time job in college, she loved it so much she decided to turn it into a career instead of using her education degree to become a teacher (the first woman in her fam to not be a teacher in GENERATIONS. Not a scandal, but a hard choice she backed up with evidence of working at a place she loved). 20 years of climbing the latter and working her ass off. Providing a good life for her boyfriend. She loved it, she was happy. We moved a couple times for the company. Amazon takes over. Wholefoods people were worried at first, but the immediate changes were all good or neutral. Until covid... it immediately became a wholefoods warehouse. People being managed by the minute rather than the shift. Restroom breaks discouraged. Paranoia, firings, managers walking out mid shift (managers, not just part time employees, managers walking out).
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:43:43'] They are pricy, but just about all that they sell is some top shelf quality. I like them for their bread, meat, fish and chicken. Their bison is excellent too. Veggies are high quality too, but I have other places to shop for that with quality just as good but better pricing. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the stores are well lit and clean. Is it the only place I shop at? NO. I also shop at Walmart, Aldi's, Trader Joes and Target. I could never get everything I wanted from one store.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:00:39'] Whole foods is meh,  co-op and erewhon are better
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:12:56'] Honestly I only use it for meat and seafood since the quality is bonkers compared to all the other grocery options around me, but I‚Äôd forget them in a second if there was a local alternative
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:16:52'] It was a transformational change for me. It transformed me from being a Whole Foods customer to someone who now avoids their stores.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:17:39'] I used to work at Whole Foods. Most food is overpriced but it has a reputation of supplying high quality meat and seafood. Rich people love Whole Foods. I definitely noticed that Whole Foods prints tendies. Middle aged dads love the beer selection and middle aged moms love the wine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:19:09'] Whole Foods is no longer cool. It's Trader Joe's now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:38:50'] Personally, Amazon being involved made me less likely to shop there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:46:38'] I want to shop there, I just can‚Äôt afford too.  Even the budget grocery stores have an organic section.   There are some exceptions.  WF has an unparalleled bulk nuts/grains/berries section if you‚Äôre into that shit.  They are getting their ass eaten on other fronts.  They are relying on their name at this point rather than the service they can provide.   I can sniff out the same quality of products at better prices on my errand runs, so long as I‚Äôm willing to make 3-4 stops in a week.  If they want to capture my patronage, they need to bring their prices in line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:55:40'] Whole Foods used to be amazing. I used to love their hot foods and produce. Everything has legitimately become so banal there between Amazon taking over and the effects of pandemic. I used to legitimately drive out of my way to grab a coffee or beer there with a little snack. Not anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:57:30'] We greatly reduced our shopping at Whole Foods once Amazon took it over. Used to hit it up at least once a month. Usually 2x. Now we go there about 3x a year. Only cuz there‚Äôs something very specific we can‚Äôt find elsewhere. From 12+ times a year to 3.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:27:10'] Never went to WF cause it‚Äôs expensive as fuck but now I don‚Äôt go to WF because it‚Äôs expensive af and fuck amazon so two birds one stone it‚Äôs nice. My parents recently discovered WF tho and they spend like $90 on cheese and jams weekly now
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:30:39'] As a former WFM employee who was there for the ‚Äò15 restructure and then the AMZN takeover I can only offer my view. Fundamentally WFM was behind the curve in org design and efficiency measures that while they tried to fix, only compounded problems in culture. Having no clear plan and direction with buy in from all levels created a us v them mentality that was brewing under the ‚Äúalls well‚Äù mentality. Grocery retail is a fickle animal that I think is turning into the battles of regional powers like Wiegmans or H-E-B that national brands cannot compete against. I think the WFM banner will be gone within a decade with maybe the 365 line remaining in some version of Amazon Fresh as they have to cut the fat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:07:36'] Prices are too high like Publix, selection is limited like Aldi and customer service is mediocre like Walmart. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt shop at Whole foods.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:34:57'] Let‚Äôs see. Service and quality at Whole Foods has declined. Amazon shoppers jamming the aisles. Produce department is hit and miss. Checkout can be a complete nightmare. Certain items are 50% more expensive than at Traders. Just not sure there is much for Amazon to brag about in this acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:27:00'] It helped me, I love that they save me an hour driving if I want something from whole foods.  Although they messed it up a bit when they split the delivery service into two unrelated sections, Fresh and Whole Foods, no idea why they did that and you can't get every item on both sections, nor are they delivered together.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:14:34'] I don‚Äôt understand. The only way it was ‚Äútransformational‚Äù was helping amazing get a grocery business. I‚Äôm speaking only from experience shopping at austin Whole Foods at least once a week for years. Also shop at heb. To me the Whole Foods is mostly the same. I hate to say it but the little Amazon enhancements have been nice like features in the app that help me shop etc. I think many people MAY not realize that Whole Foods has lots of products they DONT contain shitty ingredients. Not every product, but lots of them. It‚Äôs costs a little more but, as others have said, the two store system really works for me, HEB fills in the items that are too expensive from Whole Foods. I do throrougly enjoy going to Whole Foods downtown in Austin though. Lots of smiling happy people, clean store, good selection if you want nicer items.  Lots of beautiful people lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:05:03'] I shop at Whole Foods way less after the acquisition. Quality of product is down and the Amazon integration is cringe at best.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:11:10'] Quality of many 365 products went down. Hot food item quality has gone done. The meat and produce for fresh is awful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:59:16'] Whole Foods is a higher end grocery store. It‚Äôs great for some harder to get products and I go there a lot for meats that my cheaper store won‚Äôt have as fresh or high a quality. I don‚Äôt go there for milk though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:25:56'] Dude 3 years ago I worked next to a whole foods. I ed coffee was 4.95 a cup and it was like $1.50 more than Starbucks or Dunkin. It was 100% worth the $5.00. best coffee ever. Some of their products are absolute slam dunks. If it was 7 dollars today I'd still buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:59:36'] Sorta missing the point of an acquisition. If you aquire a well performing business and make zero changes to it, you've done well. Don't know the ins and outs of this story, but as long as Whole Foods didn't start losing money post acquisition, then it was still a smart move.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:27:39'] So much photoshopping in this picture. Clearly turned those shrunken heads into lettuce.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:19:35'] The kind of people who religiously followed Whole Foods were absolutely pissed off they were bought out by Amazon and vowed to never shop there again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 21:39:30'] I worked at whole foods before the merger and I worked there after the merger, I completely disagree with this article. Big changes came into the actual stores as soon as Amazon started sending down their directives.   In my particular store we introduced online ordering/pick-up, introduced truck-to-shelf inventory, and a few other changes that made working there a completely different experience.I never did truly understand *why* Amazon wanted to purchase it in the first place, but it gave WF a nice influx of money to upgrade their stores. Not a bad place to work and their product line-up is pretty great. I'll never forget the time the dairy team broke me off a vegan snickerdoodle ice cream cookie sandwich. Eating that thing was an orgasm for the mouth the entire time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 00:59:22'] It was great when it was included in same day delivery with prime.

I was there a week after he left and the food there was overpriced (as usual) but it was all junk. It was always overpriced, but for a long time the takeout was quick and good. When I was last there it was terrible. People were not helpful, much of the healthy stuff they had was gone and even the overpriced pizza looked like trash.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:01:25'] A 14 billion dollar acquisition of whole foods sounds like child's play and a no-brainer compared to the market cap of places like Costco and Walmart. If anybody, Amazon has the infrastructure and scale to turn whole foods and do a 200 plus billion dollar cash cow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:13:20'] Amazon fresh is slowly expanding and taking up real estate through the less expensive areas.  It‚Äôs putting in items with more favorable profit margins while still offering the same look and feel of Whole Foods.  Give it 3-5 years and you‚Äôll see Amazon fresh as the marquee name that all Whole Foods will eventually become.  Once the Whole Foods name is gone, expect the profit margins to go up higher as they squeeze value out of the chain

Every year. Best deal in town and the service is good. You have to get them literally the weekend they get them in or they will sell out.-my crunchy wife loves buying supplements/vitamins. I think they are a waste of $ but they have good selection.-beer selection is good. They have an especially good selection of German import beer -the bulk foods selection is good. If you want a little bit of specialty flours etc. it‚Äôs the best place to go. All said and done though- Central Market is the best grocery store in the US. Nothing else even comes close. If anything Amzn buying Whole Foods has caused their quality to decline overall.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:19:27'] It helped their supply chain a bit and helped them move into Amazon fresh. Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods likely use the same chain so I think that‚Äôs the bigger play as they continue to expand Amazon fresh. I use Amazon fresh and really like it. Grocery shopping was one of my least favorite chores so it‚Äôs worth the few extra dollars to not deal with it. Prices seem about the same, you just tip the driver $5-10 so that‚Äôs really the added cost. There is less variety on meats I feel, so that‚Äôs maybe the only downside. I used Whole Foods delivery too and it seems no different then fresh but pricier plus they do $10 shipping.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:34:05'] I think Amazon bought Whole Foods because they wanted to know the name and address of every person spending $2.00 for a banana.  They clearly have too much money and Amazon wants all of it.But more seriously I think it was about acquiring them for the people who built a value add shopping experience.  They sell the exact same products as competitors and charge double.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:55:06'] I can‚Äôt afford to buy food at Whole Foods. I eat 6 meals a day. I have to buy the most nutrient rich food for the cheapest amount possible. That means the words ‚ÄúWhole‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoods‚Äù don‚Äôt enter my mouth. Bodybuilding ain‚Äôt easy. I went there once and bought some food nothing crazy and it was like $350. I thought I was at Costco for a second but realized quickly that this was only enough food for me for a few days.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:23:22'] Honestly Whole Foods doesn't interest me at all. Overpriced supposedly healthy foods. There is no budget options in that store that I could see and most of the healthier options can be found in other stores. The recession won't be kind on a place like that either.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:26:37'] The deal was about logistics, not expanding whole foods sales as a siloed business. 80% of Amazon's traditional dollar volume comes from within 5 miles of a whole foods.The whole foods supply chain is responsible for reducing costs in Amazon's "last mile" delivery. Whole foods warehouses now hold Amazon products expected to soon be ordered in that locality (bc predictive analytics)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 21:50:56'] surprisingly nobody mentions the fact that this company is sitting on $512.5 million in cash equivalent earning risk-free interest income as the fed continuously increases the fed funds rate. Thereby aiding the company with better ability to manage cash flow with higher interest income with limited to no debt on the balance sheet. $333 million was used to buy marketable securities of short duration fixed income now earning at least 4.5% annualized yield. So the downside risk is minimal from a permanent loss of capital perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 20:37:30'] >The reason I'm excited about Rocketlab's new reaction wheels is because it indicates that they are now targeting the mega constellations market, which is currently one of the hottest markets in the space industry. These reaction wheels are specifically designed for satellites that weigh 600-700 kg, which just so happens to be the size of many of the satellites being launched by companies like SpaceX and Amazon. This could mean big things for Rocketlab in terms of revenue growth, as they will now be able to tap into a market that is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 21:23:25'] SpaceX uses their own reaction wheel design on Starlink, and they‚Äôre way less than 120k per reaction wheel. It‚Äôs one of the big reasons why they‚Äôre able to keep the costs per sat down. Most of that cost is in the raw components, not in the integration costs.Amazon is basically recycling former Starlink engineers and their reaction wheel designs seem to be very similar, so there‚Äôs no way that they will be paying anywhere close to $120k for Rocketlab to assemble them.Furthermore, 10k sq ft is a tiny cleanroom. Not going to do 4.8bn in revenue out of something that you can buy for ~100k‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:47:12'] amzn earnings were not bad in my opinion, yeah they missed eps but thats to the rivian loss and every sector grow was insane except aws, but 20% still good. especially in times like this. beat revenue and gave quite a good forecast, i don't see the earnings the way the market has respondet to it

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:44:59'] I think some people bought today just picking back up the shares they sold for loss before the end of the year. Well that applies to AMZN and Google. Apple is whole different thing that have different dynamics. I don't follow em that close any more. I don't own any of them. My last position in Apple I sold 4 yrs ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 11:34:49'] \#1 - 1/2 of these are not catalysts lol .... CES ? our team is meeting with our amazon buyer at CES. This is our 3rd new buyer in 6 months, turn over is real and the buyers have no fkin clue what they're doing. CES is getting smaller every year because its really not a valuable show to attend, most of the stuff is prototype shit thats not even available for sale. with amazon's fee structure every company is actively trying to find more ways to sell on every platform except amazon. AWS is the only thing saving them.  \#2-#3 doesnt mean its going to be good...  \#4 CPI could go either way   \#6 It can always go lower P/E still way out of line for new era of value stocks  I'd be more interested at $60/share or less
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:23:56'] lol, buy it and come report in 6 mo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 12:44:08'] I hate dumb lists... It reminds me of some people with political discussions who have lists of irrelevant things to post in response to any reasonable discussion, even if the list makes no sense.Now, to be clear I think AMZN is a great company and have invested in them before and made good money if that investment, but I did sell a little while back because I was having trouble with the value case for them (not that my other investments did much better, but felt it was time to pull out of AMZN...).So let's take a look at your list for the heck of it.1. CES 2023 on Jan 5th. - Who cares. This is an annual event that has zero impact on the long-term fundamentals of AMZN.2. Earnings Feb 1st. - And so? Every company that has declined in value had earnings at some time or another as well as every company that has gone up. It is just a day that info may come out that will move the price, not a guarantee which way.3. Last years Feb earnings was the biggest move in stock market history (+14%). - As they say in investing... prior results do not guarantee future performance.4. CPI Jan 12th. - So invest one way or another in SPY as that reflects the impact of CPI better than an individual stock.5. UMICH Jan 13th. - No clue what this means6. New 52W low. - Whoopee doo... Every stock before it reaches it current 52 week low, reached a prior one... which means nothing. Stocks can go up or down regardless of lows or highs.7. They pump the stock Feb/March because the number stock refreshers to employees is based on average Feb share price. - Ok... not even going to bother with this.8. Consensus EPS is a softball. - I think the consensus for Q4 is $0.20, which comes to under $1 annualized, which means AMZN is trading at a 85X+ PE ratio.9. Cost-cutting happening right now (layoffs 10%, Alexa deprioritized). - cost cutting is necessary but perhaps sales will be down and profits impacted in any case... meaning the cost-cutting is keeping things afloat as opposed to making them profitable.My take... maybe it goes up, maybe it goes down... definitely this DD you have done is crap though.Maybe try real DD next time... Like if you exclude AWS from the picture, AMZN lost $10 billion in the last 12 months. Or how if you exclude AWS, AMZN barely makes money. As to AWS, during the last few years growth was very strong, but has recently slowed down. In any case would take several years of strong growth to justify even current share prices. Basically an investment in AMZN is a bet that they can turn their retail business not a massive money-maker and that AWS will continue to show strong growth for the next 5 years. My guess is Q4 will not answer these questions and will leave a lot of doubt as to the future potential of AMZN and if it can grow fast enough to justify the share price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:29:53'] When qqq goes down, every tech companies go down, and we're still in a bear market. Nothing specific to Amazon will matter until the trend reverses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:59:54'] lets see what happens ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)!remindme on february 2 2023
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 06:33:11'] >1. I believe that CES 2023 will be a very important event for Amazon. They are likely to unveil new products and services that could have a major impact on their business.2. Earnings for Amazon in February could also be extremely significant, as they will provide updated guidance for the year ahead.3. Last year's February earnings were the biggest move in stock market history (+14%), so there is potential for more upside this time around if results are strong again.4 CPI data from January 12th will be closely watched by investors as it can give clues about inflationary pressure in the economy which may impact Amazon's margins going forward 5 UMICH consumer sentiment data due on January 13th could also shed some light on how consumers are feeling about spending money online 6 If AMZN shares continue to fall and make new 52-week lows, this could trigger further selling pressure 7 Some analysts believe that employees at Amazon receive stock refreshers based on the average share price during February, so there may be some positive buying activity around this time 8 The consensus EPS estimate for Amazon is currently $1532 , which represents decent growth from last year 9 Finally, cost-cutting measures taken by management recently (such as layoffs of 10% of staff) suggest that they are focused on improving profitability

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 14:50:57'] I've read your posts and comments on this subreddit basically shilling META AMZN and other shitty growth stocks. Why not just buy ARK? How you want to invest is your business, but I would strongly caution others on investing in anything with a PE over 50 in this rate environment. Between QT and the erasure of consumer spending power, this is a very long play. Be prepared to buy and hold for 2 to 3 years for 15%. Call options are going to be straight gambling over the 1 year timeline.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 12:56:53'] I think AMZN will be below $50 a share by end of March.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 12:08:24'] OP apparently doesn't read the news about how people are abandoning Amazon due to them not providing diverse products. They act now like an ad service. I seriously do not like shopping on there anymore. Too many fake reviews, too many promoted products, too many hurdles to buy something I want. I still shop there, but they are starting to show their weakness.

When recession and inflation stabilize we are sure to see higher growth rate with more companies connect to the AWS services. **Non-AWS in 2023**It's fair to estimate that after almost 2 years of bad and unusual economy, now when things are set to be stabilizing, Amazon's non-AWS services will surpass or at the very least breakeven the -$11.4B gap they left last year.**Is Amazon a Buy?**In my opinion, Amazon is going to be facing some more slight decreases in the short term, as we haven't left inflation and recession threat completely yet. As for where the winds are blowing, it's easy to see that 2023 is going to mark the end of this weird market and the rise of companies like Amazon.   For a long term, Amazon shows a great opportunity for investment to me. But wait at least until they release their horrible Q4 report before buying.

However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\n\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities.

All he cares about are his own companies internal metrics for success. He never used his IPO for startup capital, he was already successfully running a business and anytime the stock price falls, is usually based off complete bullshit media sensationization of at best inaccurate information.He dosnt offer stock options because he doesn't want any board members making any decisions based off stock price. In other words. Amazon is a stable stock to buy for a value investor.

Put 20% of your income into a mix of index funds, ETFs and Bonds and watch your money grow year after year after year.  In the last six months your 20% would have been buying stock for cheap.  Trading can earn you a lot but you can see not everyone is really cut out for it.  By simply investing you'll have a 7 figure nest egg and you'll support the economy.   Cheers.

Don't even get me started on the almost 1bn they spent for show they won't even report viewership on because it's so embarrassing. Nobody and I mean nobody is buying prime just for the streaming.Web hosting by far the most stable business but also a lot of overhead and I don't see a lot of growth potential. Speaking of which how you think they gonna raise new capital?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 16:08:04'] >It is good to see you, DeadSol. I am doing well, thank you for asking. As for your question, the current Amazon stock price of $94.18 is below my breakeven point of $101.66, so I would not recommend exercising your option at this time. However, given the overall positive trend in the stock market lately, it's possible that Amazon's share price could rise above my breakeven point in the future and at that point it might make sense to exercise your option and sell shares of Amazon stock at a profit. Thanks for letting me know what you're thinking and happy Thanksgiving!

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:42:54'] Schwab's stupid security won't let you screenshot on mobile. How dare they prevent me from sharing my losses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:33:49'] He bought a put to sell someone 100 Amazon stock for 2800 each. Stock dipped so the put went itm. The broker bought 100 shares for 2600 each and exercises the put for 2800. He bags 100 x 200 but he paid 7170 for the put option. So 20k profit minus the 7170 premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:00:19'] I‚Äôm just about to ban myself from this sub, I‚Äôm becoming physically ill from the fact NOBODY here understands what you did, and it was an options 101 play. Congrats, may god have mercy on our souls.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:46:16'] Really that many people that invest that don't at least know the basics of options?( not trying to diss anyone)  just saying it's a great tool to use compared to just buying shares if you don't have a ton of money to play with.  Nothing wrong with buying shares and holding also.  Congrats in your gain!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:23:02'] Congrats and ...Also Schwab UI is the best
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:22:46'] Exercising puts hurts my brain trying to comprehend. How‚Äôd you take that picture, with an actual camera or do people with Schwab just always carry around 2 smart phones?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:57:39'] Let me translate to the apes. They seem to be having a hard time with this. Guy bet 7g on an inverse squeeze and the stock rocketed down. He profited (look the word up) 13k. Then he went home and fucked your wife. Can someone help translate with emojis for the majority who can barely read.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:34:41'] Wonder if the put would have been worth more tomorrow? Safer this way I guess

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:24:49'] Why not just sell the put tomorrow? Still has plenty room to drop
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:35:17'] What took the picture of your phone? Do you walk around with another camera?! Who does that. Do you know what a screenshot is?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:35:25'] The option would be worth 15k+ tomorrow if the current price holds.  But i guess you never know what happens in the morning

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:42:03'] How‚Äôd you exercise after hours?!?!?!?!?!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:44:50'] I love how you took a picture of your phone, rather than a screenshot.Reminds me of my older clients who print a PDF, sign it, and re-scan.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:54:49'] The real question is, did you have the capital to cover exercising the put or did they spot you the money to short the shares before buying them back?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:03:13'] Bruh used a phone to screen cap a phone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:04:46'] A photo of a phone ? What year are we in already?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:07:19'] The premium would have been insane tomorrow tho. Rather than exercising for equity?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:22:30'] WTF?  You can exercise an option after hours?Did you have the buying power to afford 100 AMZN shares?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:36:54'] How do you exercise or sell contracts AH? Is this just something your broker allows? Because I've had to watch profits drain away on after hrs movements...perfect example is Apple today I had a straddle, would've loved to exercise the call, then the PUT 20 min later with that movement...Edit: I can usually buy or sell shares but do nothing with contracts
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:55:02'] The contract cost though, eye-popping. Congrats
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:59:34'] Do you need 260k in your account to do this? Or do they just give you the difference as profit?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:02:33'] Did you buy a second phone to take a picture of your phone with the gains?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:06:34'] TIL you can exercise your options AH. I'm going to remember that for future earnings plays
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:11:31'] Wish you had the option of doing screen capture on your phone. Congrats and fuck you btw! Big balls!

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 18:02:27'] Why would you exercise this today? Surely with the increased volatility and the day before expiry you could sell this with a substantial premium and make more money?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 18:23:11'] Why did you do it that way and not just sell at open?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 18:28:08'] This confuses me every time so u gambled were right and made 5 k off in vesting 7 k am I understanding this right? But in reality just sold the stocks once they hit the correct amount....

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 12:19:30'] I think many have these stories. My regret was not buying when I thought I should.  We were mostly poor, so risking money was not in my genes, the risk of losing was too high. That's what keeps you poor.  I passed on Apple in 2001 ($10 at the time, pre-splits), passed on Microsoft ($25), passed on Amazon ($75) and just messed around with ETFs.What feels worse 20 years later are the chances I never took, not the stupid ones I did take.

Back in 2003 I said it was stupid for them investing in warehouses to hold their inventory and later 3rd party inventory. Shows you what I know. I declined a job there before that offer and twice after as most as recently as 2005 was close to a pretty senior role that I was a finalist for the but just missed.

There‚Äôs a few really nice houses borderline mansions on a gorgeous lake off this road and fuck if they didn‚Äôt expand the roads right up their ass.  Amazon can get shit done.

You don't even need to drill down hard into the numbers, the CNBC article says everything you need to know:> AWS revenue: $17.8 billion vs $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccountAnd:> Amazon disclosed revenue from its fast growing advertising business for the first time. Advertising services grew 32% year over year to $9.7 billion during the quarter. Previously, Amazon included advertising revenue in its ‚Äúother‚Äù business segment. While advertising has always been viewed as a tangential business for Amazon, the company has had so much success attracting ad dollars that it‚Äôs now third in the U.S. market, behind Google and Facebook. Google reported fourth-quarter ad revenue of $61.2 billion, while Facebook notched ad sales of $32.6 billion in the period.Their EPS has nothing to fucking do with the jump in price. Instead, people are excited over two other massively successful businesses that Amazon is in.

Nasdaq grew 5000 to 15000 in 5 years. Thats not all innovation and tech. Thats QE and piling up fed balance sheet with historic growth. Now that QE is going away. Interest rates os going to increase. If inflation runs at 5% it will be violent. We have to get used to that stock return does become negative and asset appreciation is 2-3% a year, not like quadrupling money in a year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 02:39:22'] A company in which employees shit in their pants has no future but Bezzos survived this quarter, sure it's because of Rivian and the pandemic online shopping but next quarter will be "fun" for Amazon, just the fact that they are increasing the price of Prime says a lot.Your puts will probably get gangbanged by a green dildo today, but next quarter that's when puts play might make some sense.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 08:27:39'] Good call out OP.  This is why I always question immediate stock rips as soon as earnings are released.  It takes time to digest and analyze these reports.   AMZN might not go red today, but they are setting themselves up for a bad next quarter and I think the price will adjust accordingly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 05:13:25'] I came here to say this / agree with this.  The main part of the business is loss making.  It's only AWS that means it is making profit.  At a PE of over 50 it still needs to do a lot in terms of getting more profitable/revenue growth to grow into's it's valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 05:54:49'] Man I feel this. In thinkorswim, on the charts you can right click and a menu shows Buy/Sell, and if you‚Äôve got the auto send on it doesn‚Äôt even give you a review before sending.My mouse button was acting up and one day I right clicked and it clicked sell on its own, immediately sending a sell to open 100 shares on AMZN order.So I shorted like $285,000 worth of Amazon on a green market day and nearly shat myself. Yet, my stubborn ass straight up _refused_ to lose money on my own mistake and so I waited, and waited. Longest 5 minutes of my life as the thing ticked higher but then hit resistance at 2900 and dropped Closed the short for a $200 gain which actually isn‚Äôt bad,  but it in hindsight the risk was astronomical üò¨üòÖ
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 06:18:17'] On the positive side, this can gap up Tuesday morning and OP can make 10k.    But overall, always close out your ITM positions before close.  If not, you'll definitely get assigned like that HS homework bro.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 06:41:33'] You'll prob end up ok..ish.. Broker might even auto liquidate the shares given how much into margin you had to go.The worst hit will be the margin cost across the weekend. Don't know what broker you use, but 5% margin on over 200k is gonna be a solid hit

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 20:55:17'] Holy shit you guys pick the companies with the highest P/E ratios.  You‚Äôve got the lowest amount of upside and the highest amount of downside risk. Besides hardware companies I‚Äôm staying away from most of Big tech right now. I hold plenty of semiconductor companies and only three tech stocks. Apple, Netflix and block inc (SQ). Actually I just bought Alibaba two days ago. Amazon is like the last company you wanna buy calls for with rising fuel/labor costs and supply chain issues. Rising inflation will cut into profit margin especially if they decide to offer competitive pricing comparable to their competitors. Which, they‚Äôve had a history with in the past. Their profit margin has always been very thin. I just wanna help some of you guys sometimes lol. Also you should make a rule with yourself to never buy an option with less then a month till rip.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:01:57'] I honestly don't think it will be great because of the CoVID restrictions in some places were lifted. This created a psychological effect of people going out and consuming elsewhere other than the online platform where it's basically a localized Chinese product outpost. If the earnings would be anything, it may have just met, but I don't really think it would get anywhere close to exceeding. The virus is indeed disrupting normal market trends indeed.EDIT: I stand corrected with my dick in a vise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:25:30'] Short answer is IV. Longer answer. With tech stocks being very volatile around earnings and reporting as of late, the implied volatility with so many unknowns was greater. With them releasing earnings and expectations, the unknown was now known. Therefore the stock adjusted, and upon open today the volatility has subsided. Therefore, the earnings are now priced in, and the chance that it drops another 10% in a week is low.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:22:27'] Earnings IV Crush always sell right at open after earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:20:19'] >It is possible that the premium you paid for your option increased in value even though the stock price went down. This can happen if there is a decrease in implied volatility (IV) of the underlying security. When IV decreases, options generally become less expensive.

POST_TEXT: b'Photoshop software owner Adobe (ADBE) is scheduled to announce Q2 earnings results on Thursday, June 15th, after market close. They are a SaaS company, SaaS stands for "Software as a service." A software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet. We\'re going to be going over this in detail later. Like many other cloud-based businesses powered by AI, is poised to generate substantial cash flows in the future. Particularly, Adobe\'s market is expected to grow at a pace of 13% until 2030. \n\nThe consensus EPS estimate is $3.79, with total revenues between $4.75 billion and $4.78 billion. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $4.76 billion, implying growth of 8.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarters reported figure.\n\nAccording to seeking alpha: \n\n* Over the last 2 years, ADBE has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time.\n\n* Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates ha'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 12:25:17'] The thesis for going long ADBE is simple:This sub has almost 14mm followers, and 99% of the people that post ‚Äúgain‚Äù porn use photoshop to entirely make up trades (or to turn their losses into profits) for fake internet karma. If ADBE can get just a fresh 10% of this sub to start posting ‚Äúgain‚Äù porn, that equates to almost 1,400,000 new customers. All in calls.

Some stonks even play games with this so ever other time the future looks amazing and the price goes way up. ADBE has everything we want and no sketchy ups and downs.

I'm long on amazon. They have so much money they don't know what to do with it, so will begin buying back shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 13:54:27'] I think a strangle on $SPCE is a better application of your logic here: * $AMZN isn't directly affected by success or failure here, especially since Bezos stepped down as CEO. I think you're less likely to see a huge valuation drop than maybe a little blip if he goes boom, but it would likely be short lived. * Blue Origin has a much better track record and engineering design than Virgin Galactic - no failures in like a dozen tests vs. several failures in like 3 tests for VG, including a fatality. New Shepard is an autonomous vehicle, Spaceship 2 needs to be hand flown by the pilot, which introduces a lot of room for error as seen by the fatal flight. * $SPCE is going to have insane volatility one way or another - I think the biggest concern is picking an expiry that factors in potential launch delays, which would probably result in a slight dip but not a crash. I'm going to be opening a 7/16 strangle on $SPCE (probably like 35p/60c) on Friday with a target movement of about 50% in the underlying. Best of luck to you and your degenerate bets üçª

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 21:46:44'] They are really rushing this space race and that is never a good thing to do.  If Bezos goes boom, I'd think that Amazon will do the same, at least temporarily. They make billions off the labor of everyone else, so I won't feel too bad making a few bucks off of some retard who decides to launch his rich ass into space because he wants to prove that his little dick is bigger than some other rich ass's little dick.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:00:06'] FD‚Äôs based on the death of two billionaires‚Ä¶truly fucking retarded‚Ä¶.damn I wish I had more awards to give.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:05:03'] I would maybe splurge on July 30th puts, more time for the stock price would just have to move in your direction by a few hundred dollars for your FD to be profitable.  You benefit from the news about the event, but also Amazon's future, also recovery of remains, maybe funeral, etc.Sadly for you, I think the launch will be pretty safe and little risk, but who knows... maybe China has some space shenanigans planned.  So could be a sleeper bet.   What result would benefit China, I'm not really paying attention with that angle.  Amazon seems to be a good customer for their products.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:10:25'] this is basically the strategy of Cornwall Capital (In the Big Short they were renamed Brownfield Capital)Their strategy was essentially putting bets on unlikely things to happen. You lose a little when it doesn't happen but you make a fuckton when it does.A 25% dip isn't out of the question if on the very unlikely chance that the launch goes sideways Shit, puts for $2070 are going for $1 a contract. People have thrown away $100 on more than one roulette spin before and the pay off here is better than 35:1

You get bonus exposure to heart attack post launch if it does go ahead on the 20th

POST_TEXT: b'Alright you fucking ****** heres a play thats so obvious and easy youre gonna be wondering how you couldnt see what I see.\n\n\nSo Zuck just got cucked on his shitty platform and even shittier Metaverse transition. That combined with paypal, spotify, and some other tech heavy less than stellar reports have broken the rally thats happening this week. The market was wayy wayy wayy oversold and is simply retracing its gains back this week. But guess what stock didnt really share in the retracement?\n\nAMZN broke out of its comfy 3000-3600 trading range that its been sitting in for the last two years, during the January correction. It bottomed at 2800 before correcting in the last 5 sessions back to 3000. Then after hours yesterday the stock dropped 200 back to 2800 purely off of investors fears that tech is getting clobbered in their earnings reports.\n\nThis is a huge opportunity. All AMZN has to do is post an OKish earnings report and this thing will pop to 3k tomorrow. God forbid it actu'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 10:11:49'] If they announce a stock split, which they should and maybe will with Bezos more distanced, it'll be a win for sure.I'm dick deep in AMZN since just before the run to 3k, so like, it's not been a bad investment but this year and a bit has been dreadful watching it go sideways missing the trend.Without remembering or bothering to lookup previous earnings and estimates, as we do, I bet analysts were a little ahead of themselves due to growth from starting covid. Amzn will near miss top line estimates, blow out bottom line, and guidance probably at or slightly below analyst.I should probably actually listen to this call as Jassy should be defining himself now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:12:08'] Well played

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:09:23'] Congratulations and fuck you I did TQQQ calls so im in as well and bitched out on amzn all together
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 09:46:00'] I think AMZN bears have a point, they are exposed to fuel costs and trucking costs in a big way, and those have continued to go up. And they did peak during the pandemic, and we know that a lot of companies that did lost that ground as pandemic cooled off, at the same time, what amazon offers is so essential it's hard to say how it's going to play out. I said it before, but I think AMZN is the darkhorse of this ER season, every reasonable cell in my body is telling me to stay out of this one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 09:30:33'] If I had enough money, I would yolo into puts. I think you‚Äôre dead wrong.

I bought 3K worth of options, expiring tomorrow, halfway during the day today, with strike prices between 3300 and 3500. IV will eat them up but I‚Äôm greedy and want to see how it begins to rip up on market open before I pull the cord.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 09:35:35'] Alibaba, which grows faster than AMZN, had meh ER last quarter. I don't think AMZN is any way better. The economy is slowing down. Look at the Chinese HSI for the past year. That's SP500\\NASDAQ this year. Don't buy anything just yet, there is no rally ahead until the rate hike and end of tapering.

POST_TEXT: b"Amazon earning are in 2 days. I am buying puts and here's why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) **Amazon-owned Twitch recently started taking more money from creator revenues** (Source:  [A Letter from Twitch President Dan Clancy on Subscription Revenue Shares | Twitch Blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/) ) The days of being alive and unprofitable are over, and the numbers need to start looking better. This reminds me of when $NFLX raised their prices right before a historically terrible earnings call. I am expecting something similar this time as well. I think its simple that amazon needs more money and is cracking down on twitch to boost their numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) **Out of the blue Prime Day 2** (technically called Prime Early Access Sales but I call it prime day 2) Trying to get rid of excess inventory? Trying to pad sales numbers? I am not sure but it doesn't look good to me.  Data suggests lighter sales than Prime "
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 10:03:08'] If you think point 1 is a big reason and point 3 and 4 are small reasons then you're saying twitch booties are the center of the economy. FYI just because you watch twitch thots, doesnt mean that that's the biggest part of amazon's business model
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 09:57:03'] that's a pretty good play for a gamble. down move would probably go below $112.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 09:54:19'] Got it, buy calls!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 08:37:09'] >I think you're right about all of this. I would also add that Amazon's margins have been declining for years, and they are now at a point where further declines will start to eat into their profits. This is not a good sign for the company, and I believe it is one of the reasons why their stock has been underperforming lately.

That's more than double Walmart and Amazon together, or like Walmart plus Amazon plus Apple plus Volkswagen plus CVS plus UnitedHealth.  Unless we get 70s inflation for a decade or two, that's not going to happen.

Twitter has to hand over bot account data for the 9000 accounts they used to create their 10-K earlier this year - everything else is denied. This is a relative MASSIVE W for Twitter.Musk's case can effectively no longer rely on the big scary bot problem.There were two other discovery disputes ruled on today as well - both of them were wins for Twitter. Musk must now provide Twitter access to the data scientists that Musk used to determine reasons for exiting the deal.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-25 20:52:26'] I did some due diligence on this investment.All the people skeptical about the metaverse are fools.The real world is super dangerous. There are murders. You can get hit by a truck. You can drown. You can fall off a building.Zuckerberg came up with a solution, the Metaverse. It is way safer. If you die it has a respawn feature.Also no need to meet women and have children. You can just have AI-driven children in the Metaverse which are less stressful.Puts on hospitals and funeral homes since they are going to go bankrupt.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 08:34:36'] > TLDR: I gambled my life savings during the last 2 years, going from $217k account to just $875 2 months ago, gained 56,000% since then, currently at 490k. Im 26yr old.-> 2017 - Feb, 7 2021: Starting investing with robinhood in 2017 and would deposit money pretty often, learned about options (shocker) and hit a high of 274k in Feb of 2021 (total deposits 217k).You're 26yo today, meaning that in 2017 you were 21 or 20. You deposited USD 217k in 4 years between ages 20/21 and 24/25? That's an average of ~USD 50k a year as someone right out of college.Something looks suspicious
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:17:12'] OP if you‚Äôre seeing my comments, another one I have to say is, isn‚Äôt it crazy these people are shocked about 200K at 26? If you worked at 16 making 90K a year on average for 10 years that‚Äôs 900K take out taxes and use the money you have for fun to invest it all and even after all this time you‚Äôve made more money and accomplished more then they have. Sad people really. If you think this is seriously gambling then yea be safe but there is a reason you got into it, if you think you have talent maybe play a bit longer and deep dive, figure out what you really think things will do, not just gambling. If you can do that you could grow it even more. Be safe and stay true to yourself. I‚Äôm 19 bruh I blown up crazy amounts but I‚Äôve made lots too. Down rn but we on our way back up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 03:54:47'] It could go lower and then you'll be further from affording that car. May isn't for a while, so you should save money responsibly. See if you have any old stuff lying around that you can sell on eBay. I've made $700 just this month selling clothes I don't wear anymore--and a lot of that was old worn-in carhartt stuff that for some reason kids will pay an arm and a leg for... Like 2x what I paid I'm not exaggerating. You might have some valuable stuff and not even know it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:12:31'] >Why would you do that? You're just encouraging her to be lazy and not work for what she wants. If she really wanted the car, she would find a way to get the money herself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:18:33'] Both are attractive stocks at the moment but you need to know when to get out before the big recession next year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:42:08'] No
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 05:45:04'] Get sum 110 weeklys for next week with the whole car fund.. triple itCan't go tits up
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:41:08'] I really don't want to sound like a dick at all. But you really shouldn't be investing if you're asking for stock picks on Reddit. What is the moat, FCF, margins, buybacks, growth-potential, macro-economic/geopolitical risks, what are the legal risks of eg Google analytics being banned, what impact will it have on its business. Can you make that assessment in the Reddit comment-section ? Sir you have a daughter so I assume you're older but I'm 24 and self taught so you should be able to do this yourself as I'm in no way a smart person. Congrats on your daughters birthday in may. She has a generous dad and that's awesome.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:34:02'] Both have recently hit abyssal lows .... I think GOOGL historically so. So in theory they have nowhere to go but up. Though, in reality, there's still a lot more down they could go instead. Welcome to stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:52:21'] No to both, bcuz GME outperfomed them BOTH this year..
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 06:01:04'] She calls me daddy too
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:24:50'] That's about $400 a month to save up to $2800. Tell her to get a job to save $200 a month and you'll match her.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 05:36:57'] You should do some research, dont buy anything.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 08:55:05'] This was the right play. Even making hedge would be stupid yesterday. GOOGL showed insane profits and went up by 6%.Most everyone would have thought that AMZN would go up more than down. And def not expect a 7% drop. I would have bought AMZN calls too because I was 100% sure it was gonna gain but doing so math, I thought a 2-3% gain was gonna be only 100% gain due to IV so didn‚Äôt bother the risk. If this had gone your way- you‚Äôd be making bank. (Imagine a 7% gain!) mad respect for you on sharing the loss.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxic4t/dont_forget_amzn_is_doing_a_historic_20for1_split/'
POST_TEXT: b'As the title says, AMZN is gonna do a historic 20-for-1 split and its finally coming. I want to be part of history. I think this is bullish despite the mess the market is currently in. A bear market rally is over due as well. This could align the stars to make AMZN a good swing trade until after the split.\n\nSo when is it exactly?\n\nhttps://investorplace.com/2022/03/when-is-the-amazon-stock-split-date-what-will-happen-to-amzn-stock/\n\n> The first will be May 27, 2022, which will serve as the record date. That means if you want to participate in the stock split, you must own AMZN stock by May 27. Individual accounts will start to update to reflect the stock split by June 3, 2022. Finally, AMZN will start trading on what is called a split-adjusted basis by June 6, 2022. That is when investors will start to notice the lower share price.\n\nI\'m pretty sure there\'s gonna be plenty of confusion about the record date and the "must own" phrasing of the above text, but this date doesn\'t really matte'

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 04:42:43'] Stock splits are bullish in bull markets because lots of stupid money is chasing - are we still in one?Stock splits are neutral in bear markets - because stupid money is getting decimated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:38:25'] Splits are of course meaningless and don't change anything about the business, valuation etc. It is to attract retail. It's like going into a store because it says SALE with 20% off tags on everything even though the goods have the every day normal 233% markup.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 07:55:46'] I am all in on this I agree we are truly due for the rally and AMZN  is a well run ( 100 Companies in one )  . I read a blog that compared AMAZON  to being the Berkshire Hathaway of the future  . I agree  you see so they hit a bad retail quarter that was slightly worse of what people thought on high expetations . Well every company  did on the stay home situation going away .  I personally get  4 deliveries a week  saving me time , fuel , and best of all  the best prices out there .  This is where people will shop in a recession and also in good times . AMZN is the KING OF RETAIL  and always will be .  Take a look at the long list of companies they are growing into profit farms it is truly amazing .   This will be a huge FOMO event at prices  as low as this  and we could double our investment in a short period. This will split at  $122.50 and  then  by 2024 -25  be well over  $4000  again possible for even  higher . I bought  Bershire Hataway years ago for the same reason  and plan on Amazon giving me even better returns .  Thank you
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 13:07:26'] guys forget about it, amzn is going bankrupt soon ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 13:18:18'] If hedge funds are invested in amzn and if they have to liquidate their assets during the flush, at the current price, does this make amzn more of a clever trap? The reason being is that retail will get access to their split shares after the big institutions have received their split and tanked the price. And not only that. After the split has occurred. Hedge funds could short amzn to take advantage of retail selling their shares after them. I think puts on amzn seem better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 11:30:17'] >1) I think that the most important thing for people to remember when investing is to always stay disciplined and not get emotional. This can be difficult at times, but it is crucial in order to make sound investment decisions.2) Another important factor to consider when investing is diversification. Diversifying one's portfolio across different asset classes and industries can help mitigate risk and improve returns over time.3) Finally, it is also important to have a clear understanding of your goals before making any investments. What are you trying to achieve with your investments? Are you looking for short-term gains or long-term growth? Once you know your goals, you can better align your investment strategy accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 05:38:17'] Tldr: aws and other important areas of focus (advertising for googl) are the future of their businesses and are driving growth
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 05:36:59'] That's a lot of words to say: market movements are based on human feelings, and not on facts. Crypto just went up 10% after the Fed announcement. So yeah, nobody knows shit about fuck (unless insider info).
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 06:01:39'] sounds like someone shorted at the bottom
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 07:53:30'] Why did you mark "Purchases of Marketable Securities" yellow without any comment?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:16:36'] Amazon is pushing automation hard.The new system I saw in Seattle basically requires half the people for the same amount of work.The Automation is expensive though. And will take time. It's only expected like 12 of the 200+ logistics sites will have the new automation but they expect 200 to be finished by end of 2023. So Amazon is going balls deep on investment.This automation also does this, you can instead of fire half the workers keep them but increase output.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 08:24:11'] I believe the main reason they missed target is because of the loss they took on Rivian Investment. The inventory increase is part of supply chain cycles typically after a shortage. You can see a significant increase in inventory that would affect cash flow. Amazons financials look solid compared to industry
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:06:20'] Nobody gives a fuck about single period net income. They went up because strong guidance and aws.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:01:28'] Nice! Not sure AMZN is the best short when the market turns, but I agree, this rally will be short-lived
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:43:28'] Higher inventory can also be a voluntary choice to anticipate to the supply chain issues worldwide
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 10:18:45'] I think the recent dip was a bit too much for tech. But the overall non tech scenario is pretty bad based on walmart earnings. This will being the entire market down along with tech. Big Tech companies will survive for time being because they rely on the middle class who are sitting in their couches like rocks and vital for the country.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 00:53:14'] You probably have no idea about what items are included in the calculation of net income‚Ä¶Eg RIVN participation related loss.Other than that,their earnings were great,revenue was great in the current macro environment.

So maybe let 1 of the 128 calls ride since you have 2 of them. But if you like your gains just sell all of it. And hold cash for the next play.

If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp.

Every tom, dick, and Harry in trucking or big farming operations was contracting fuel as far out as they could a year ago by the tanker load even if they had to increase their line of credit to do it.Edit: I forget that they contract a lot of freight so forget everything I just said, I'm a moron.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 17:05:23'] With you on this. Picked up some AMZN220715P02160 a month ago. Think earnings won't be that bad but guidance will really disappoint. Amazon is one of the few mega caps with really stretched P/E ratio and a long way to fall if they can't demonstrate growth that justifies it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 18:30:00'] Not to be a buzzkill, but I don't think AMZN makes much money through retail; most of comes from AWS.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 18:18:36'] Went to Home Depot and Lowe's yesterday. Thought it was a week to Christmas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 18:01:49'] I want to add to this: notice all the christmas decorations out in frikin august?  I thought it was just some weird costa rica thing but it looks like it was in a few countries, too many goods to sell, not enough buying.  Another good economic indicator is the canadian tire flyer, when the economy is strong, things arent on sale as much, and not a high percentage, but when the economy is weak, good items are half off, sixty even seventy percent off
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 17:50:31'] They did move Christmas up early this year. It‚Äôs not just AMZN though with the decorations. I think the EU is going after AMZN for sanctions on Prime. Haven‚Äôt heard much about their cloud business side.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 22:32:37'] I just cancelled by prime membership after reviewing my usage benefits they provided.    150 bucks annually saved.

Unfortunately Jeff Bezos ethical standards, Amazon work environment, the way they stole business from smaller third party seller, the flood of low quality fake Chinese product on their site turns me away. I am sure that their cloud service is huge but I would rather use Microsoft.  Hope to get behind a company with better culture meanwhile I am losing out on their stock gain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 11:27:14'] Buying short term amzn call in this shitty macro environment is indeed very ballsy move. If you wanted to ride the split momentum IF there is even one. Then should have picked Google.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 19:42:40'] What a week for bear loss porn.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 16:45:39'] I‚Äôll never understand you guys that keep trying to short the entire market the year *after* a -25% decline.The time to buy puts was 18 months ago when the Fed started telegraphing their rate hikes. All of the negative economic doom and gloom going on right now has been predicted for almost two years now. That‚Äôs why such a sharp decline happened *before* any actual negative economic indicators started showing up.It. Is. Priced. In.EDIT: for those who don‚Äôt understand, think about it this way‚Ä¶99% of wsb being bearish and buying puts does nothing to lower stock prices. The *only* thing that lowers stock prices is sell orders overpowering buy orders. When talking about SPY, that means institutions and wealthy boomers panicking.It‚Äôs one thing to short an individual stock. With SPY, the baseline is billions of new dollars being pumped into the market every week via 401k contributions alone. It takes some actual unexpected economic news to outweigh that and we‚Äôre still 12% off all time highs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 17:33:46'] Expect you're gonna have a bad time here bud. Market will provide greater clarity over the next week, but - with this breakout - I wouldn't be shocked if we end up going on an actual run until ~July 25th or so.After which, once everyone's re-convinced we're blasting off back into a full-blown bull and bought the top to institutional capital unloading, we then begin a slow (into eventually rapid) descent and collapse into actual recession sometime in 2024.Edit: Market's gotta spend some time looking super irrational (continual upwards movement) before a real chance at collapse, is what I'm largely convinced of at the moment. But again, will have stronger expectations based on how we perform over the next weekHonestly, if today was rough - I'm expecting that you're going to be in a world of hurt come market open tomorrow.

POST_TEXT: b'\n\nWhy the recession seems to not be happening.. in most places.\n\nBasically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \n\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they dont keep up with AI, wont make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasnt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \n\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will '

POST_TEXT: b'Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:33:21'] **$ORCL earnings play (post mortem)**  Lots of ways to win on this one. Always easier in hinesight. **Pre-ER Straddle/Strangle**  Looks like if you purchased an $ORCL strangle/straddle prior to the recent run out that would have printed. If you bought yesterday, who ever sold you those call options did a little bit of a happy dance today.  Looks like $ORCL held $120-$121 for a little bit, enough time to sell those call options. If you went with the C110, which last Thursday was at the money, that would have went from $2 -> $12 (selling at 9:45AM). If you did that in a reasonable straddle or strangle, you costs to enter the position would have been about $6. That would return about +100%. **Post-ER Scalping (1 Trade)**If you were in a post-ER scalping mood, you would have picked up the $118 PUT around 10AM, and rode that like the 1 trick pony it was all day long. 10AM price about $1. 4PM price about $2.45. Which would have been a nice +136% for relatively little work.  **Post-ER Scaling (3 Trades)**  If you were in a post-ER day scalping day trade mood, you would have picked it up through some of the drop offs, get caught in a few minor spikes, but ultimately be a winner on the day. (+14%).  Trade 1: 10:18 -> 12:43 (P118 -- +24%)  Trade 2: 13:19 -> 14:15 (C120) -- -34%)  Trade 3: 14:45 -> 15:52 (P118 -- +24%)

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:25:43'] All those words and no emojis. I‚Äôm tired now. Already fully loaded on $CLNE, so thank you for confirmation bias.Seriously though, it seems like CLNE will be in a spot in the very near future (if they aren‚Äôt there already) that they basically sell every drop of RNG they can possibly produce. Everybody wants it for those sweet carbon offsets and CLNE is one of the big boys in the industry. I think RNG is gonna have a parabolic type of adoption curve in the next 5-10 years while other companies try to figure out more electric stuff (solid state batteries, cleaner lithium mining, etc.).

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 01:20:55'] Most of the news lately tried to demolish the bull thesis saying that Total is unloading shares heavily... On seeking Alpha they also wrote a wrong headline saying that Total sold 10 million share, while the count as of 08/06 should be 6.4 million.  Total needs to [finance the JV](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005231/en/Clean-Energy-and-Total-Sign-Joint-Venture-to-Develop-Carbon-Negative-Fuel-and-Infrastructure) with $CLNE, whose budget can be considered expensive for an oil major too:  *"The initial firm commitment is $100 million and can increase to $400 million as development opportunities progress. Since Clean Energy and Total will be providing the equity portion of the investments, the actual amount of capital invested in RNG projects may be higher than $400 million depending on the amount of leverage that is deployed. In addition, Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure."*Why cash is so important for RNG projects? It is important because in order to win the assignation of RNG projects (whose scale is increasing over time) you need to be the highest bidder. Many are competing to get these lucrative projects (Chevron, $ENB, single small companies previously active only in the ethanol segments)What $CLNE has that others have not is the distribution network...and look what Chevron is doing: [Chevron brands its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site) *"Chevron U.S.A. Inc. announced the Allied Clean Fuels Plaza retail station in Napa, California, has been rebranded as its first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) site. Chevron expects to rebrand or open more than 30 CNG sites by 2025."*

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 01:16:01'] whatever happens with Amazon (which is clearly good news) $CLNE is an up and coming green sector company which has a real edge over the EV truck manufacturers - the CLNE product works - current trucks can be easily retrofitted for RNG, RNG refueling takes minutes compared to hours to recharge an EV truck, EV batteries weigh too much to be viable in long distance lorries hauling large loads and take up too much space, the green sector will be THE sector over the next 10-20 years

Sure they want to sell the securities for more than their cost, but if they don't it's a tax write off, and the greenwashing campaign is where the real value is for Amazon. Not saying they want to sell at $7 a share, but the benefit they receive from Carbon-Neutral greenwashing is worth a loss for them. Nevermind, $30 EOW üöÄüåôüöÄüåôüõ∏üß®

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 21:49:01'] I am selling my CLNE first thing. Thx
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 20:02:25'] While I'm a complete newbie on the stocks and investing side of things, I do have some expertise in low carbon alternatives. There is a huge cloud for this in the medium/long term. It's a great short term play to move towards carbon neutrality but there are far better (and cheaper) solutions on the horizon. Pretty much every diesel truck manufacturer knows the days of diesel are numbered. Cummins is throwing $1B at fuel cell development.  Even CLNE pays lip service to it on their web site talking about using their product to  make hydrogen or electricity...It's highly unlikely they'd be competitive with other technologies to make either.   While Jeff probably won't give Elon an order for Tesla semis virtually every other truck manufacturer is also working to develop them and as soon as they reach cost parity, it's game over for diesels, it won't matter what fuel they're burning... Once they're here the switch will happen and fast... Logistics managers will sell their mothers to save 2 cents a hundred weight... At that point  RNG loses a lot of it's advantages...  While CLNE  talks about RNG being used to make electricity, unless they can undercut historically low natural gas prices and make a profit,  that's a nonstarter.  Bloomberg is already predicting as much as $35B in gas fired power plants as stranded assets by 2030 unable to compete with cheaper renewables (and that's even factoring in cheap NG)  so if they're closing who are they going to sell the RNG to to make electricity from it? Same is true for hydrogen... While today the dominant source of H2 is reforming methane unless you can undercut the H2 from electrolysis of water from surplus solar  you're going to be in the same boat.. They're probably safe for the next two years... after that... hard to tell...

POST_TEXT: b"Big warning for AMZN bulls: AMZN has to markdown their losses w/ RIVN. Last quarter they added an $11.8b gain due to RIVN's IPO, which is why they had such a large EPS beat. This quarter will be very different due to the markdown. See quote from their ER last quarter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November.[Sauce](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/business_and_financial_update.pdf)\n\nWill the street ignore their negative EPS and focus on AWS growth? My assumption is EPS will miss, primarily due to the markdown - however if AWS growth is flat or also declines, AMZN's in for a huge red day.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Last quarter EPS: $27.25 actual vs $3.88 estimate. Why the mass disparity? RIVN. I'm very curious to see how the math looks tomorrow."

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:16:42'] That‚Äôs my main reason for being reluctant to play Amazon earnings. The Rivian IPO inflated their EPS last quarter. The company won‚Äôt have that crutch this time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:38:20'] I feel like EPS will miss. Andy was hinting at it about a month ago. Supply chain issues and inflation worries are worse than last quarter. This concern might continue for another quarter.I'm also a little concerned about AWS growth being an issue. If MSFT (or others) eat into AWS revenue/growth, then AMZN might drop quite a bit.The caveat to that would be, for those who have cash and want to do some boomer investing, then maybe think about buying the AMZN dip.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 02:40:50'] the market certainly didn't not price that in

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 18:15:35'] Ford had the same problem. Did not tank them. I do not see Amazon having a big drop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:33:28'] I figure it'll drop a good chunk. The market is on edge right now, any bad news will cause a significant drop. And after last earnings, I figure Amazon needs a miracle for it to not be "bad" news.

I called it in and decided to sell when they told me the fix won't happen until overnight.  I will update on the 80 x $130C 6/24/2022 later in the week. Cheers!
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 13:18:59']  I feel like Amzn has had alot of hold outs that's kept from selling waiting for this split hoping for a tsla/apple run. Otherwise I think Amazon would be alot lower. It's ER and forecast were horrible and it's p/e has yet to properly reflect that. If it does pop I'm definitely buying puts
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 06:28:23'] You're about 4 days too late. The "action" on it already happened .. like AMZN being up something like 10% this week including a 6% day a few days ago.The run up on the split already happened. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Unfortunately you bought the news...

POST_TEXT: b'Hello. On August 12th, something very strange happened. The url amazon.com/affirm no longer led to an error message. In fact, it redirects to a link that says "Pay over time with Affirm" in the tab title, and, if you\'re on the app it says "Search in Pay over time with Affirm" in the search bar. ipad view: https://imgur.com/rGLmrwy\n\nIf you do a "view page source" you can ctrl+F and see the "08-12" that verifies that this url was set up on 8/12.\n\nNow let\'s explore the url it redirects to. It has a specific "node ID" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011\n\nUpon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-29 16:31:34'] Thank you for sharing. Glad it worked out well for you. I believe this kind of creativity n determination is the only way to make above avg returns. I can help with making a script or brainstorming. I think the key is also developing a strategy around idea. I've read about HF scanning fourms + chats for product sentiment or reporter posting urls on financial data before official release. Either way good luck diggingüëçüìà

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-28 12:03:17'] I don't have a position, but it feels like earnings could send the stock +5% to -20%. If you're a degenerate gambler, puts seem like the play over calls. I don't see how $AMZN avoids the inventory disaster Walmart is experiencing. Maybe cloud better than expected cloud growth could send it higher if you're looking for a hail mary?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 06:50:20'] GME is the wayüöÄ
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:34:16'] It all depends on how long you want to hold. The splits are good, but if you are not long to realize the full value: quantum work GOOGL is doing and their cloud biz;  TSLA with autonomous-taxi and AI assist personal robots;  AMZN full warehouse automation, etc., and for course AWS is a monster revenue stream and will continue to multiple.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:57:24'] If you can afford all 3, split your profile to suit all 3.  IF you have to take 1, take Amazon. Retail is slowly dying out and everytime the highstreet loses value, Amazon gains value. It's growth potential is still absolutely huge, it has virtually no competitors (and nobody is even trying to, in all honesty). The others both have competitors, that could somewhat displace them sometime in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:10:38'] Usually a conventional split is bullish AF but does anyone else find it rather strange Tech giants are doing it in the same timeframe..
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 07:14:34'] correct me if im wrong please... but historically before every stock split the stock rallies then the split happens and the stock normally gets sold off and falls in price that was the case with apple at least then it traded sideways for months before it started to gain again with earnings etc.So why buy stock specially if you missed the initial run up like in teslas case why not just buy leaps when the stock splits and ride those for a year or two. For one they will be much cheaper since the price has been reduced and you will still make the same amount of money if not more since you can now afford to buy more calls or even shares at that point.Edit: I should clarify im not saying tesla shares are going to fall in price after the split but they will remain stagnant for a while or they could rocket as the stock would be much more affordable for young investors... but i think some of you are confused as to you making more money when the stock splits. Your one share is now 10 shares etc but your money does not change.. Its the same as you waiting for the stock to split and buying the same amount of shares at that price instead of jumping in when the stock is close to ATH

It's essentially steady income, forever. My main thinkorswim account is about $780,000 and I go between selling 20-35 AAPL puts at around 75 delta otm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 21:42:29'] I can tell immediately that OP has a very extremely dangerous gambling issue. Not only is he finding ways to get all this margin out per play using a ‚Äúshitty UI‚Äù that can screw up his position planning. But he‚Äôs also buying way too many contracts for an account as small as his. Yes 1-2 million dollars is extremely small for 8000 contracts. Even my buddy who‚Äôs networth is closer to 40 million and is a 1% trader has not gone higher than 600 contracts with a month or so expiration. Although his long term stocks can make him a million a day just by holding he doesn‚Äôt go for bust on his portfolio. At 2 million dollars OP should literally throw this in dividend stocks and VOO and quit forever. You won. You got 2 million.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 09:55:40'] Seems like the general consensus here is to just close all positions, stop trading altogether and invest in index funds. I think that might be the best course of action because i am worried about losing all my money. I cant even stand a 20k loss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 09:48:40'] Before you lose fucking everything.  Step back a second and really learn what you are trying to do.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 15:43:59'] This is the downfall of so many addicts; the thoughts of "I'm down from my peak, I'll just get back to the peak again and then sell." "I'm down from break even now, I'll just get back to break even and then I'll sell." "I've lost almost everything, I'll just get back to $50K so I've still got *something* left" and so it goes until you lose your last dollar, blow your ancestors 40 years of hard work and savings, and probably put a bullet in your head. *This is a casino*. You cannot get good at *gambling*. You get *lucky*, that's it. At least you've only lost $20K. Sell this shit and invest in index funds and ETF's. Jesus bro, your account is hanging by a thread and you're one bad decision away from fucking your life up. Please be smart.

It has to dump soon right?NVDA Puts same reason \^NVDA Naked Calls. I didnt feel comfortable added more shares to the short at the moment so i sold calls instead hoping to get a better entry + premiums. I collected around 1500 from the apr expirations and i hope to collect the full amount of these may expirations tooQQQ Covered call. Just to lower my average some moreShort FutesI figured i should hedge my account with futes since i have quite a few long positions. Unfortunately i couldnt bring myself to close them at a loss so i kept adding to it which makes me overall a net short portfolioTsla Strangle. i thought that would be a wide enough range for the stock to move around and collect some risk free money

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 09:47:38'] assuming a high correlation between those stocks, i'd guess the delta on those nvda and qqq options along with the short are enough to mostly hedge the stock, and the futures are doing way more than hedging. judging by today's drop you'll be able to ride this to valhalla. maybe don't do it again though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 11:25:12'] You really should not be shorting if you don't know what you're doing (your words)). NVDA and AAPL are not something you short. You wait for a pullback and buy more. Give it time, and most longs will recover some of your losses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 14:18:10'] My biggest suggestion is to add a beta-weighted delta column (balanced to SPY). This will help you see if you're overall long or short the market and how exposed you are to price risk.It looks like you're short SPY and NASDAQ futures as a hedge on your long stock positions? But I think you're way over hedging them so you're very short the market as a whole.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:30:52'] Yes, but it is unlikely considering your positions.I have dig myself out of -30% to like -3% last week and I belive this week I'm breaking even and will catch up with SPY. I probably don't belong here for saying this, but what worked for me was selling everything at one point and going 100% cash. After that I waited for buying opportunity. What I did was waited for one of the bigger drops and loaded on high quality stuff dragged down by the market - mostly healthcare(CI, UNH, CNC), but not only and sold again on the next rise. Companies that I woudn't mind holding anyways for longer, for as cheap as possible. Basically swing trading, only stocks, not a single option. Took the money at average 5% gain on position, but I got 2-3 positions at most with 80% invested so if I make 5% on each of the 3 positions is like 10-12% total portfolio gain. And this seems to be working - buy low sell high. Not having exp. date helps a lot to wait it out until it pops. Never traded hyped up stocks, never will.What do you expect from AMD at 95PE? What could reallisticly happen to that stock - five times more expensive than the average SPY company? Go to 150 PE? You are just gambling there, with extremely high chances of losing and very tiny chance of making insignificant profit. https://preview.redd.it/kluwylj0g9wa1.jpeg?width=1584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c00ef23b0efd9977be07fcaf388605a0154abab0

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 02:06:13'] Great analysis.  Here is my "based on financials view/opinion ".Right before this "pump" the CEO stated from magic pixie dust that NVDA's "forecasts it will earn $11 billion during the same period next year‚Äîup 50 percent from analyst estimates." Based on what? Crystal ball? AI? The homeless guy said it?  What regression technique forecasted that much? Also look at insider sales this month. Enjoy the ride!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 00:55:41'] Cisco sells wires. Its stock price should always have tracked, and should always track, traffic. Nvidia sells components and software. It should track number of users imo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 07:29:50'] Once it becomes clear the growth in their revenue is not sustainable and will be heavily cannibalized by other chip manufacturers, it will pull a Cisco. Until then retail will continue to pump it.

POST_TEXT: b"Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500s +8%.\n\nHere are what analysts expect:\n\n* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts\n\n* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\n\n* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)\n\nThey're expecting a drop in Disneys second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. \n"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:37:32'] Everything was going so well, until it wasn't..Topazeco woke up on this faithful morning to a normal bed and normal routine. Remembering that Amazon had earnings upcoming, he all but fumbled his way through a newly acquired stock market trick; *Options*.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:40:32'] Thanks for the real advice and shit talking. Lessen learned, get with brokerage that does AH trading quickly, listen to earnings call, prime option, wait just long enough for good news, click button, prep sell, click button at first sign of bad news. ‚úîÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:41:04'] You are letting your emotions block your reasons. Your emotions convince you to believe that they are working against you. The initial pump is from the good results of past. The dump followed is reaction to negative guidance going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 18:42:40'] It was up initially because earnings report was better than expected. It then dipped because during the earnings call the CFO basically said AWS won‚Äôt be growing as quickly as it has for the unforeseeable future. AWS is the big long term money maker for Amazon. Retail is going to be a low margin business forever. So AWS/advertising are the most important to Amazon and when the CFO said that he basically said for the next x period it won‚Äôt be as good as it was. I think he specifically said single digit too which is a major bummer because they were growing in the 20%+ YoY for years
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:52:26'] I don‚Äôt know how seriously you‚Äôre asking but technology and competition between Robinhood, Webull, etc means that trades can get filled at wider and wider spans of the day. Trading at lower volume hours can be erratic if huge activity happens all of the sudden.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:34:23'] Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/If anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 23:56:05'] On a long view, TSMC is too big to survive.  Their position right now makes the tension over Taiwan far hottter, and now a systemic risk for every major economic power.If you've got a 10-15-year horizon, the market will resettle with them competing much closer to parity with several regional/national champions, fed by virtually limitless cash from Washington or Beijing or Brussels for security reasons.So I'd say short TSMC and long INTC.

I know how the the payoff Graph lookslike and that you are profitable when shareprice goes above Strike price.Is it also possible to get profitable when shareprice moved in the right direction ?&#x200B;EDIT: Break Even = Strike Price + Option Premium Paid So if shareprice moves towards Strike price then also the option price increases?

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-02 15:49:59'] The thing is that these looters dont understand that even carrying their cell phones in during a crime could incriminate them in the all too immediate future. Also when residents complain the corner sign amd traffic lights have security cam...they take the cam down but keep the microphones on. And sound is really almost just as good as video. For example theres a math formula that relates jet noise acoustic profile to engine characteristics such as fan blade count and aerodynamic envelope that gives listeners an idea of the size and dimensions of the plane. "They" are definitely doing this w voice recognition. Hot mics will soon be on every street corner if they are not already.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 16:48:02'] AMZN is like a index with its over blown stock price it goes down 500 points then goes up 100, probaly gives most of its owners heart attacks, which is why AAPL etc do stock splits, it attracts buyers and the few dollar up and downs are not a problem. This is probably why you sold, the wild swings then sideways, the other side of the coin is bad news AMZN shits the bed gapping down again by 400 points. I am never doing over night option plays, only intra day, all the moves happen pre and after market anyway, no one can predict those, fck that noise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:27:23'] PE is only about half of what you need to look at when evaluating growth oriented companies.  You want to look at PEG ratios, which take into account not just the current value, but the growth rate.GOOG may have a PE of around 20, but it has a growth rate of \~27% annual.  Peter Lynch has used a simple metric of PE = growth rate to value companies (this method is close to using the PEG equation).The mega caps aren't over valued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 14:10:03'] A low P/E is a good sign of stable growth without loading up on debt or diluted stock shares. AAPL has a P/E of 23, very good, and a Net Margin (Profit) of 27%. In contrast, TWTR has a P/E of 202 and Net Margin of 4.27%, meaning not keeping up with 8% inflation.    It is weird finding out Dorsey only held on to 2.5% shares. That means he never believed in the corporation and had been selling off controlling interest in shares the past 10 years. Dorsey is an example of a CEO selling off shares after IPO to finance the corporation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:09:39'] I heard somewhere that if you are talking about PE ratio means you don't know what you talking about.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 05:56:46'] Puts on Amazon at earnings. They changed the platform for their streaming service and it absolutely sucks. I don‚Äôt even watch tv much but my wife pays for 4 or 5 streaming services and she can‚Äôt stand Amazons new layout. This says a lot‚Ä¶ she said she hates it and hasn‚Äôt been using Amazon as much since the change. Big mistake on Amazons part, I think they are going to loose subscribers.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 16:33:28'] How could this have ended badly. You have a call credit spread with the short strike at $3,780. You need AMZN below that. AMZN peaked at $3,773. If you held to expiration, you ought to be fine. Did Rh close you early and mess your day up?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 17:57:17'] I really don‚Äôt understand how this is a loss? This is the ideal result from a call credit spread and is therefore a win. What was the premium you pocketed? The only ways this was a realized loss is if you don‚Äôt understand spreads and closed your position before expiration or Amazon hit  between the strikes after hours and you got exercised on the short leg.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 18:46:18'] How is this even a loss? Amzn closed below your strike on expiration. You only lost if you actually closed at a loss

POST_TEXT: b"**Why I bought $AMZN Calls for the Space Flight Tomorrow**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPretty no brainer trade tbh, only two scenarios can occur, both of which benefit Amazon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : Successful Space Flight**\n\nThis is the most likely outcome. The flight is good, and $AMZN rallies cause people are stupid as hell and don't realize that Bezos has nothing to do with Amazon anymore. Also the market has been red for 3 days straight and JPow wont allow that to happen so tomorrow will be green regardless. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 2 : The Rocket Ships Blows Up In a Big Fiery Inferno Ball of Death**\n\nThis scenario may initially come across as bearish, but is actually the complete opposite. With Bezos dying, 30% of Amazon's entire float would vanish into thin air since he controls most shares. A dead guy cant sell his shares, so we could technically treat this event as a giant 1 Trillion dollar $AMZN stock buyback, which would happen instantly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 17:06:17'] Nicely done. I guess one could sell 2/3 and hold 1 longer, maybe even overnight. But with 1 DTE, I think you did the right thing. Lock in the nice gain for peace of mind and look for another opportunity, right?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:57:02'] I predict Amazon will soar, simply because I bought puts. My thesis is that we see Amazon miss earnings as they lose share in the cloud computing space, and face higher labor and delivery costs on flattening sales during Q4. But every move I make is wrong so Amazon to $4k is probably more realistic.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 12:43:54'] I LOL'ed when this was posted because it's an irrational bet without any supporting analysis.

And then just for kicks and giggles, I bought a 11/22 $SPY $307 put.  I should've gotten vaccinated before reading this post.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 13:08:04'] This is fucking retarded. You are betting a $50+ drop by tomorrow. By Monday, your theta will take a huge bite out of the premiums.I knew there was a GUHpedemic but nobody told me how serious it was until I saw people were buying options just before it reaches terminal theta.Correct me if I'm wrong here but this is no longer FDs, buying options 2~3 days from expiry is financial BDSM, you are doing it for the pain inflicted on yourself and the public humiliation

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 20:45:43'] I have a hypothesis. WSB has gained some mainstream attention these past few weeks. With large amounts of attention come the possiblilty of manipulation. I think Hyre here know this and is doing a reverse pump and dump. Traders seeing this postion may be taking large positions against this trade. Hyre here has a couple of million to throw around so this trade is just chumming for the sharks. His real postion is in AMZN calls.  He‚Äôs posts this supposed YOLO here in hopes of baiting other traders into taking a large postions against him. Which would cause the stock to rise. In which case yea his puts expire worthless but his real trade will set him up for a whole winter of high dollar hookers and boofing cocaine. He‚Äôs using the power of autism to pump his real postion up. It‚Äôs brilliant but still incredibly stupid if the there no real movement and trade goes sideways.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 08:43:13'] This kind of play is stupid unless you can tolerate the risk. Not being able to tolerate the risk of your position forces you to close it out as soon as it moves against you. I‚Äôve closed out positions for 20% loss because I couldn‚Äôt risk the exposure of losing my entire account on a single trade, only to see those options climb 1000% the next day. And doing this with weeklies is maximum autism. If you‚Äôre going to throw it all in at least have some theta to spare.

I really don't wish that upon anyone but here is why I can't stand it.It's a lot easier for squeezing up and that's what is going to happen.You deserve the result because no one in their right mind should short Amazon during Christmas.Now if you make money, hey God bless you, but I wanna see this, I'm setting alerts right now to watch Amazon so I know when it's dropping or squeezing up to take your money.I'm also mad at you because with $100,000 you can sell naked otm options every week and just make free money and if you are only into making $1000 - $5000+ per day, then even more stupidly you shorted Amazon instead of trading 10 futures daily to make massive gains on the pump that is happening.But anyway I'm sorry I had to call you out on it.You don't short, you wait for good prices and go long.If you want, sell puts way otm weekly and sell 100 or whatever and let them expire worthless this friday.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 22:29:13'] When your calls go ITM you should sell them, buy equal number of OTM calls (if you feel there is still room/momentum on your side) and pocket the rest. This way you will at-least hedge a little bit against any unexpected surprises.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 09:28:51'] A second similar way to become a successful sports bettor is to beat line movement and ergo create closing line value. If the consensus line is 3 on an NBA game and a particularly sharp sports book for NBA wagers moves to 2.5, you want to be on the side of the bettors who moved the line by betting +3. Hours later when you see 3 no longer exists anywhere, and the consensus is 2, you can know you made a good bet.How you accomplish this is a more elaborate story, but being on the right side of line movement is key to winning long term.

You will wish you did do this when Q1 comes out and the stock collapse under $10. Would that cost you more than $100? Pass this word around!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 10:51:32'] Sports betting is NOT worth it if you are in the USA and plan on ever paying taxes on your winnings.

And this took many years even after the initial Ryzen processors were onto the market with great results, beating Intel in processing power, efficiency, adaptability, scalability and also cost.Now look to SPCE, what the fuck do they have ?

Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week's ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.\n\n# Market-moving News\n\n**The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend "

POST_TEXT: b"So as so many posts talk about, AMZN stock fell over ten percent after Q1 earnings call. Most sources say this is due to a non-operating loss of [7.6B from their Rivian](https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-q1-fy2022-earnings-report-recap-5270247) holdings (which is a publically traded stock and has been showing a steady decline in value over the past quarter of 54%.)\n\nMeanwhile, AMZN revenue matched expectations, and I couldn't find expectations for operating expenses but it's [13% more than last year.](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Q1-2022-Amazon-Earnings-Release.pdf) However, EPS were at -7.56 vs the expected 8.49, seeming to lead to the price fall.\n\nConsidering  Amazon's public  RIvian holdings, why was this not priced into EPS and a surprise to the ever-efficient market?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:07:53'] > However, EPS were at -7.56 vs the expected 8.49, seeming to lead to the price fall. Considering Amazon's public RIvian holdings, why was this not priced into EPS and a surprise to the ever-efficient market?Probably the same reason why the spike up last earnings was a surprise factoring in RIVN profit. I'm long-term bullish on AMZN and I think in both earnings, the upside and downside were overreactions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:13:05'] In Q4 earnings beat came from RIVN stake and it hasn't been priced into Q1 EPS LOL
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:28:41'] Don't think the fall had anything to do with rivian it was known long before earnings. F had the same problem still beat and has held up far better than Amazon did .
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 04:43:05'] I‚Äôm not necessarily saying I agree, but there are two salient differences between AMZN and F. F had a $6.6B swing, 82% of it was their Rivian loss, and they reaffirmed their prior full year adjusted earnings. AMZN had an $11.9B swing, and a smaller share - 63% of the swing - was due to Rivian. They also forecast uncertain earnings going forward, warning that they could post another loss. The part about Rivian should not have a large per share impact on AMZN - although if you‚Äôre not familiar with it, the phenomenon where a parent stock has a bigger drop than the loss in value of the daughter stock - there is a famous example of this involving 3M that‚Äôs always brought up in behavioral economics. But the reality is that Rivian has a very small market cap compared to AMZN (not so much compared to F) - diluted on a per share basis that loss is small - even if the entire AMZN investment in Rivian loses its entire value, from here, it ought to only lead to a <1% decline in AMZN‚Äôs value. But the market is also forward looking, and if AMZN is going to have increasing difficulty making money on its product sales (vs services) then that‚Äôs a bad fundamental for a company that has a really large product footprint. Some of the headlines on Ford were also unfair - they said that Ford was losing money because of its bet on electric - but Ford is doing nicely on sales of their electric vehicles - in the long run, if the Lightning F150 succeeds (and as a former engineer, electric makes so much sense for pickup trucks) then remember how many pickup trucks North Americans buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 22:52:15'] I think investors would have wanted to see AMZN without the RIVN impact having made diluted EPS of $15+ on top of stronger retail growth. It was much weaker and I think led to concerns about whether AMZN can sustain the growth needed to justify $3K+.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 19:50:44'] Reddit should share profit with all the content shared on this network, especially tucker Carlson and Alex Jones.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 20:47:30'] Hmmm - there is something to be said about that, because data does have a cost, but there so much cost to compute so it not sure it will bring meaningful roi at the early stages. I think they think their ad revenue generation sucks because of Reddit bits and trying to make up for it
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:16'] So an data aggregator social site that doesn't pay for any of the content it allows on here wants to charge AI companies to scrape the same data. They really don't have a means of making money, this is going to tank when it IPO's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:25'] No wonder the google CEO is now saying their A.I. is doing stuff it wasn't trained to do. It's like hey lets teach our A.I. to learn off of some message board. What could go wrong.

Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

Since your option adventures are so profitable you have the pulse of the market and its infinitely easier to trade stocks. So what if SPY goes from $470 to even $400 you wait it out for the eventual return to $485 lol. Having the cash to micro trade 4000 shares of SPY is pretty good, slower than options but you are as good as gold or better.

Amazon would develop its own analytical platform and don't need BB to do that.&#x200B;Drones might potentially run BB OS but i would doubt that. So your thesis doesn't sound that solid to me honestly.Now, do i have solid info or data on this ? no. but have worked in amazon/aws and relying on that experience to say there's nothing bigger coming of this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-11 09:15:19'] There is absolutely no reason to waste that much money on QNX if you‚Äôre Amazon. Amazon can develop whatever the hell they want - they already wrote all of their drone software without it.Seriously people don‚Äôt understand that Amazon is far more aggressive than Microsoft ever was.You do realize that BB‚Äôs current market cap is less than 1/10th of Amazon‚Äôs cash on hand right? If Amazon cared that much about the technology - they would simply buy them. Amazon absolutely does not ever let a single company hold that much power over them. So in this case the options are: a) Amazon doesn‚Äôt see the BB ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù as being much value, or b) BB as a company is still valued too high.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello my good friends, I wish you all good fortunes in the year 2022.\n\nI think you should long $AMZN because Bezos is looking more and more like a super villain each day. And super villains are usually mega-successful financially. Or in movies at least.\n\nAlso his wife left him, so there\'s no reason for him to hold back on pushing the company to the moon anymore. If $AMZN values at $100 trillion tomorrow, no one will come split his fortune from him.\n\nMy last bullish argument is that Jeffee is dismantling a historical bridge for his mega yacht. I view this as very bullish for two reasons: 1) Jeff ain\'t stopping at nothing to get what he wants. Say what you want but the U.S. economy reward those with ambition and aren\'t afraid to hurt others to get what they want; 2) Jeff likes to spend his cash in an "african-american" rich style. To maintain this lifestyle, you\'ve gotta keep them monaaaeyyy coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere you go, three short bullish thesis. Go on and buy some calls on $AMZN. T'

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 13:12:41'] You put 80k on a stock pick price that‚Äôs the highest it‚Äôs ever been in a long time. AFTER EARNINGS.....I‚Äôd slap you silly, but instead I‚Äôll just say this.You could hold for a miracle which MAY happen.Which congrats! And fuck you!Or you could sell but be unable to save your loss of massive destruction. It was a bad move putting that much on such a small thing.Would have bought rental property and got 1,000 a month. Property is always valuable. Anyway, it‚Äôs up to you man.You do you. I‚Äôm just a broke chad.But I‚Äôm telling you man. You could play it either way.You might be right, but you could be wrong.Not brokerage advice. I am ape.

Any indication that the massive bleeding of funds has ended will be seen as good news. That has been the trend with banks lately it seems.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 14:29:36'] Hmmm. I'd wait with those Amazon puts 5-7 months. I think 4th quarter and 1st quarter will be fine with supply issues. 2nd quarter maybe it becomes clear how hard they are hit. World largest online retailer is going to feel supply issues.   But remember they do a lot. Cloud hosting is growing exponential. I hear good things about Prime.   Carefull to bet against a behemoth. But yeah. Once supply issues are reflected in earnings stock will go down. Just not yet.  But then again. If you wait too long it's going to be priced in already and puts will be even more expansive. So maybe now is a good time to position yourself.

POST_TEXT: b'Yesterday, Lina Khan, a vocal critic of Amazon, was sworn in to lead the FTC at age 32. \n\nKhan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittees 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.\n\nKhan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed Amazons Antitrust Paradox, which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission also continues to probe various Amazon business practices to determine if Jeff Bezoss corporation is violating antitrust laws.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/platform/amp/recode/2021/1/22/22244186/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-nomination-biden-administration\n\nhttps://www.law360.com/amp/articles/1394715'

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 07:41:46'] I buy all of my cheap Chinese stuff from Wish, and it's never failed. I buy those solar fairy lights in bulk in every single one of them have worked, and still working after two years.I like them because I order stuff and I forget completely about it and then in a couple of months a package arrives and it's like a big surprise.This year however, the shipping time has decreased dramatically. Like only 2-3 weeks. I haven't even forgotten about the stuff I ordered yet and it's arriving. It's very disconcerting.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 09:14:49'] When you $WISH upon a star!! Let's go to the moooon!!!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 06:57:57'] the amount of people who've yolod into Wish without ever actually using it or even reading about it is insane. it's basically just cheap chinese factory shit that failed quality control, sold at the same price as the stuff that didn't fail on Aliexpress. and it takes twice as long to be delivered  Even if it wasn't pure shit, Wish is not a direct competitor to Amazon. Amazon's main selling point is convenience. You want something, it's at your door in 2 days or less. Wish's main selling point is low prices for stuff you don't really need. It's fun to go on Wish when you're drunk and spend ¬£10 on a load of weird shit and then forget about it until they arrive in a couple of months. No one who actually needs anything buys it on Wish. It's like comparing a dollar store to Target or a pound shop to Argos. It might be even worse than that. It might be like comparing gypsy markets you get in town on a Sunday to Argos or Target, except you have to wait 2 months for it to arrive

POST_TEXT: b"# Based on [Statistica 2020 report](https://www.statista.com/topics/4076/amazon-prime/) AMZN has 213 Million Monthly Active Users, per latest 2020 10K report WISH has 107 Million Monthly Active Users.\n\nThis means that for every MAU Amazon makes roughly $1,500 and WISH makes $25.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 20:40:32'] seeing it slowly come back over the past week has been so fucking good
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 00:43:37'] I think WISH is super undervalue from a fundamental perspective. BUt I think the company overall need to make some changes to the quality they sell on their website.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 02:49:10'] You need to break down AMZN down into its segments. AWS and Prime make up the bulk of their profits. E-commerce and warehousing do not make as much but the structure of the business is quite different to WISH. I would say that WISH is disrupting Dollar Tree, Thrift/Novelty shops. Wish has a lot of unique items that you won't find anywhere else.I am very bullish. They utilize customer payments and long shipping times to effectively get free financing for their operations so in the long run they won't need capital to keep the business running. Right now they have a huge marketing spend so you want to watch that along with MAU growth, and perhaps AOV if that info is published.The biggest threat to WISH is not AMZN but BABA. AliExpress sells a lot of similar products, they own Cai Niao which is basically like the global version of Amazon warehouses on steroids. Their goal is to get the majority of packages delivered from the warehouse in China to your door in 72 hours. I have used both Wish and AliExpress recently, and AliExpress had gotten a lot faster, whereas my Wish producs never arrived and I had to apply for a refund.I am long both WISH and BABA, but WISH has a lot in the works (private label through Wish Select, free shipping through Wish Access, etc) which can make them competitive. PT: $69
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:57:27'] $69 is inevitable
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 22:48:52'] WISH gonna go ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüëÜüÜôüöÄüöÄüöÄ
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:16:31'] Based off of a revenue comparison wish stock price should be 3x what it is right now
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 21:49:10'] One thing about WISH. I believe I briefly viewed a page/product and signed up for the account, just for the heck of it. And since, been getting emails contextually about that page/product. Amazing actually to see such follow through.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 04:12:17'] The worlds largest dollar store makes a lot of cents to me. WISH to the moon.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:40:53'] Damn.   The more I read up on wish they more I realize it has some serious potential at the current stock levels.   Let‚Äôs go
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 22:59:22'] $WISH is the way. Today announced the appointment of Tarun Jain, former product leader from Google, to the newly created position of Chief Product Officer. Last time I checked, Google doesn't hire stupid people.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wish-continues-bolster-senior-leadership-130000038.html
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 20:35:12'] So you're saying that wish is really bad at converting MAU's to revenue? And why did you include stock price but not market cap...What even is the stock price bar chart supposed to be showing? And why did you choose logarithmic scale?Using a logarithmic scale comparison of two companies stock price without any regard to the number of shares and market cap would be used as a basis for analysis is maybe the most retarded thing I have ever read.and youre leaving out aws, amazon media, and all their other little spinoffs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:33:16'] WISH on a CLOV.Fight me hedge interns.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 22:27:32'] This DD is so naive and wrong that I will be angry when WISH goes up, which it probably will just because of that fact. Congratulations, this is true wsb material.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 23:31:22'] So, you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance? üôÉ
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 08:16:56'] Buy and wait. So easy with this one. Never see a stock so undervalued, should be at 50$ at least üî•üöÄ
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:26:03'] this is goofy though. way more people browse wish looking to burn 20 30 bucks on something silly than people go to amazon directly to buy some product that just crossed their mind immediately in one click. i have a small couple hundred bucks holding in wish shares on the off chance there's a squeeze. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 20:55:13'] could be next week or next month, WISH is getting to 100$ minimum eventually, just a matter of time now, waaaaaay undervalued and overlooked by whales
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:54:16'] Hey genius,AMZN makes money on things besides sales from shopping. You know the whole AWS thing right ? Makes most of their profit. eBay has 180-200m active users but only makes 10b revenue. Why isn‚Äôt eBay amazon size according to your logic?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:10:13'] I got rich off the AMC and GME play...wished WSB can match those plays again. Between the coke habits and whores, Im running low on the funds
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 21:36:38'] I think wish gets bought out sooner than later... Imo Honestly could see BABA making an aggressive move. They need a win badly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 04:58:44'] I‚Äôm holding my 11c 10/15 tight, might add if ER is good
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:04:16'] WISH is moving!! Should stay on that üöÄüöÄ even long term projections $20-$35.. QCOM lost its most profitable partnership, I‚Äôm watching that tank played puts last week cause they were cheap expiring 8/6, definitely due to watch a 10% losses overall next 5 trading days easy
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 21:32:01'] I also need this baby to pop so I can unload these bags on the next "investor"!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 22:01:22'] The quality of dds has severely gone downhill on this sub..now its just people posting random incorrect shit and pumping whatever bag they are holding... amazon is much more than ecommerce, it includes aws, wholefoods, zappos and many other subsidiaries of amazon. Wish on the other hand is a failing ecommerce website that sells crappy low grade products, I don't know a single person that has bought anything from wish.. wish had -$128m net income last quarter,-569m before that.. free cashflow worsened to -354m...its operating at nowhere near profitability or break-even despite being business for 10+ years...unless the company post strong revenues next quarter, the stock is not going anywhere.. The fact that they are competing against amazon is a good enough reason for me to stay away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:36:03'] People actually buy stuff from Wish? Hahaha
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 07:32:45'] Even Cinderella was not treated so badly as Wall-street is treating $Wish in comparison with other e-commerce stock!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-04 11:59:12'] One day we will all look back to this post and call ourselves dumb fucks for not loading the boat more heavy then it allready is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-04 12:00:14'] $WISH man
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:59:22'] lol y‚Äôall have fun riding your chinese amazon calls to zero. i prefer to make money when i invest
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 19:50:51'] Mods give one ape to OP for their meme stocks post, and retarded use if ‚Äúnot financial advice‚Äù and ‚Äúcrayon‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 20:26:25'] Wtf. The y axis is log.
