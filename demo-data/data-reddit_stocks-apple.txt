POST_TEXT: b'On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giants first major new product category since 2015s Apple Watch.\n\nThe new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the companys Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.\n\nApples virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.\n\nThe device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Me'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:28:38'] $U, my ride for the day ü§∑For the Vision Pro, willing to give this several generations. Next year, though? First class flyers can try this nice little travel accessory... Battery permitting. And personally, given all the people out there with oily face types, I just don't see that problem even being looked at.But I hope this doesn't go the way of the Homepods, a lot of this stuff looks neat
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 19:00:00'] I‚Äôve got to ask myself what problem they think they are solving with this.Nobody bought a HoloLens because nobody wants to live with ski goggles on.IMO a phone is the perfect balance between being addictive enough to keep consumers looking at it but unobtrusive enough that people want to keep using it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:15:05'] Buy the rumor,sell the news but in all seriousness‚Ä¶i was really impressed with the headset..a bit pricey but thats expected for first version and what it can do. Apple showing meta how to do ar/vr the right way. The entertainment aspect is going to be huge, 3d does look amazing on vr and apple is natively integrating it into its app ecosystem which is great..on metas headset you have to use a 3rd party app like bigscreen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:05:37'] I‚Äôm guessing some early adopters will jump and get it at $3,500‚Ä¶but eventually it has to drop to ~ $1,000 or less if they want wider adoption.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:27:05'] I don't think enough people are talking about the Disney+ partnership.

If Disney is willing to cosign on something like this, I think people need to take it way more seriously than "$3500 fOr sKi gOggLeS?!" The tech review also showed immersion into sports venues and National Geographic content - there is more potential there than people are realizing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:22:58'] I increased my position in Apple after seeing investor doubt stemming from its price.This headset is for the early adapters. Apple has all the money in the world to throw at this industry until they dominate it. Apple definitely did not price this at 3.5k thinking it would be massively consumed. Imagine all of the marketing research they‚Äôve conducted for their previous products. They know what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Apple would rather lay off employees before they let this product die (sadly).There will almost certainly be a more affordable version after the early adapters get time with it.

Sure that's a luxury item at $3500 but it also seems like the next evolution in computing interfaces. I'm expecting this v1 version, then maybe one update a couple years from now, and then directly to a nuerolink method of the OS. That is, if we survive AI and Skynet becoming self-aware.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:16:47'] I was skeptical but my mom, who is totally into apple products, made an interesting point the other day that apple is probably going into VR tech planning to combine it with AI tech. So you could potentially do stuff like walk around in your family pictures or have them animated, or walking around in ai augmented movies and tv shows. I could see that being a profitable tech to explore as long as they can design the hardware to be minimalist and lightweight. If any company could manage it, it would be apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:13:16'] It‚Äôs expensive but imo they‚Äôve positioned it so well. So well that it might be the leader in AR. But boy are you paying for what you get. 4K in each lense?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:42:07'] This product is even worse than Meta's metaverse LOL and at that price point? Tell me who's going to buy that thing except apple fanatics. But seeing the amount of fanatics out there, it's probably gonna sell decent.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:42:58'] I was really hoping for an AR device on par with prescription glasses that could auto focus depending on what your optometrist recommended, that would have revolutionized the industry and on top of that could auto tint into sunglasses when outside, give directions while driving and could have incorporated some kind of Bluetooth earbud or some kind of near ear technology to be a lineup to their earbuds product line. Plus add all the on screen functionality of seeing business info/ratings/reviews. Add a record functionality, obviously there would be indicators like a light and a sound que for privacy related concerns. Anything that would require hands free activities would have made this device something amazing.The bulky headset that all the Tech companies have presented so far seems niche.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:12:55'] Mark my word: It will be mainly known for making porn. The porn industry has been waiting for the Next Big Thing. The "3D" abilities will revolutionize porn. And the fact that actors can wear and record easily will make it essential. This is the next iPhone. I remember when Stevo launched the iPhone and many questioned it because of its size and cost. And now we pay $1400 for one. This device will be the next iPhone.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 23:36:53'] Once again Apple is innovating by copying others and people are going crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 14:16:01'] For all of those wanting a set of ar glasses, you can get the nreal air 2s for 349 dollars. Ten times cheaper, and a lot less goofy looking. Plus, they have the ability to be prescription sunglasses. For vr, just buy a meta quest 2. If you really want this overpriced garbage, go for it, but both of the options I gave you are cheaper. A good meta headset costs 500-600 dollars, and the ar glasses are ten times cheaper son combined you get an 850 dollar price tag and with tax that should be around a thousand dollars, so 3x cheaper total.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:08:50'] Apple has no loyalty to chip makers.powerpc, intel, now TSMC.  (and don't forget what the T stands for)   They'll change their basic architecture for a better deal on chips.   For some ancillary like the modem, meh.   Since workers were rioting about reneged promises outside the iPhone plant,  (although not the one with the suicide nets) they are looking to go to India, since Wisconsin was too expensive, even with the government practically building the factory for them.    Chips probably don't incur much shipping cost.  India probably makes more sense, as much population, and as much of an illusion of democracy as the US.    Wisconsin, probably doesn't make cents,  those cheeseheads are going to want a decent wage.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 05:56:22'] AAPL is a modern safety stock. Unprecedented cash flow will keep the price buoyed long-term, market saturation and cost of goods cap explosive future growth. Use it to sustain wealth, not necessarily to grow it. A Buffet stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 03:46:42'] I would average my sells over, say, the next 6 months, and yeah just take out half / cost basis, letting the gains ride. also pay attention to tax implications.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 04:09:49'] Sell the minimum that would make you feel better but would still be significant. Somewhere between 10-50%, the less you sell the sooner you should consider selling again. So maybe 20-30% per year or 5-10% every month/quarter Also, consider selling calls on big up hype/mania days. Next time Apple is making headlines (like once a week) and stock is up +1% will be the best time to sell calls. Selling calls at the money is like getting paid for temporarily taking half your money off the table without being punished with taxes. Then when the excitement fades 2 days later you can buy back the calls at half price. Make sure you buy to close these calls before expiration, especially if your near or in the money or your shares will be called away, although maybe you don‚Äôt mind selling some Selling naked puts and covered calls is a good way to get paid to buy/sell stocks you are interested in buying or selling.

Your question suggests you don't have a trading system or strategy that tells you what to do, so you are trading on "feelings". The simplest thing you can do is to draw a trendline below the current price and if the trendline is broken, then sell. Eventually, the AAPL RSI will drop and there will be a better buy point, but right now, your "weird feeling" is telling you what to do.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 13:47:56'] Overall very happy with this report especially since we seen companies like Microsoft, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm all do a terrible job in hardware sales.iPhone sales actually increased from a year ago. Big surprise for me. Mac sales had a massive decline. This is what people were expecting considering previous earnings of the other tech companies we saw from computer sales. iPad also declined but not as bad as I was expecting.Wearables and accessories was flat which still shows there is resilience even in this slowing economy. Services increased again. This was to be expected and helped soften the blow from the declines in other divisions like Mac and iPad. Declines of sales in the Americas, China, and Japan. However increases in both Europe and the Rest of Asia Pacific.They also announced a 4% increase in their dividend as well as a massive 90 billion dollar stock buyback. Overall I am completely fine with the quarter especially giving the low expectations people had which you can see in the expectation‚Äôs Wall-Street had. Thank you Tim Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 18:20:42']   Based on the information provided, this news appears to be bullish for Apple. Apple reported earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, which is generally seen as a positive sign for investors. Additionally, the stronger-than-anticipated iPhone sales are also a positive indicator for the company. While Apple's overall sales fell for the second quarter in a row, the positive news on earnings and iPhone sales suggests that investors may be optimistic about the company's future performance.

POST_TEXT: b"I believe that these companies are too significant to face failure, and their growth will persist in both the short and long term. Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.\n\nYet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 22:09:04'] Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.I like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on - GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)Yes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-on-apples-new-savings-account.html\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon isnt worried about Apples new savings account overshadowing its own Marcus offerings, but he said on Tuesday hes watching closely for cannibalization. The Wall Street firm reported first-quarter results on Tuesday, a day after Apple launched its new savings accounts with an annual percentage yield over 4%. The new accounts carry Apples brand and are administered through the iPhone, but Goldman Sachs is the companys financial partner. Weve obviously worked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small, Solomon said on his companys earnings call. But well obviously watch closely to see whether or not theres any cannibalization. Solomon added that the Apple offering is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and said its always good for us to broaden our depo'

Not great brand exposure by shutting something down because you don‚Äôt like that people enjoy better features than you‚Äôre offering. I wouldn‚Äôt then run into the arms of GS. I‚Äôd see what the new rate is for the Apple Savings Account (honestly probably close to the current rate because I can‚Äôt imagine they wouldn‚Äôt find a partner, same with the AC) or look at other HYSA because closing it down suddenly would leave a bad taste in my mouth.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/17/apple-savings-account-announced-with-4point15percent-interest.html\n\nApple on Monday launched its Apple Card savings account with a 4.15% annual percentage yield. It requires no minimum deposit or balance, Apple said, and users can set up an account from the Wallet app on their iPhones.\n\nThe company said in a press release that all Daily Cash rewards earned through the Apple Card will automatically be deposited to the savings account. Daily Cash is the Apple Card reward program that offers up to 3% back on purchases. Users can change where their Daily Cash is deposited at any time, and can also add additional funds from their bank account to build on their earnings.\n\nApple is launching the savings account through Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe national average APY on savings accounts is just 0.35%, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so Apples 4.15% APY is high in comparison.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 14:51:59'] People are missing the big picture. This move is yet another way for Apple to lock in customers as part of their service/subscription/upgrade plan. The ease of use and access (removes a step or two from signing into your banking app) will allow a lot of people to just park their cash on the iPhone. They are not interested in being a bank or lender, etc. They just want to further expand their services plan to get you deeper into their ecosystem.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 08:01:57'] I'm picturing that scene in Billions where Bobby is ranting about bankers (not hedge funds owners) being the most ultra wealthy group of people. It's absurd the number of avenues Apple have open to them with the amount of cash/securities they are sitting on. I'd say the major news here is Apple becoming a bank, not 4.15% APY which the article downplays just how common that is now unless you're someone that isn't paying attention to anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 08:55:03'] Interesting to watch how this plays out, as a good amount of people don‚Äôt even know about HYSAs. 4.15% seems to be good these days compared to the field

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 22:55:52'] Ppl already missed the boat on nvidia. Im sure it will go up more in the future, but nowhere near the meteoric growth it has had in the past 4 years with crypto and AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 23:32:15'] Yeah but Nvidia is powering the Chat GPT AI right now and that's the new hotness right now.

As I see the winds are blowing Microsoft and Google are posed to be the dominant player in the AI space while Apple comes in distant 3rd with whatever crap they can cobble together.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 08:41:47'] For one? I think Apple needs to start working on making their wearables more robust, long lasting, capable of having batteries replaced, easily, by the end user/consumer and much easier to locate, if lost.I will never own a pair of EarPods, or an Apple Watch. I had a watch, once, the battery died far to quickly and then started expanding, popping open the watch, rendering it useless.If I could have replaced the battery myself? I‚Äôd probably still be using it.Apple makes disposable iWaste, which is basically eWaste, but made by Apple. üòâ

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 15:57:38'] Debt is cheaper than equity (up to a point) so a certain mix of the two minimizes WACC.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:26:15'] Borrowing money was extremely cheap at that time, especially for an extremely solvent company. They also offshored their profits to shell companies like in Ireland, so bringing that cash back the US would typically be a taxable event.So knowing that historically it most likely won‚Äôt stay cheap, why not take out a whole bunch of debt now before interest inevitably spikes. Its cheaper to run operations on debt than to pay taxes. Worst case they just hold it in bonds and then pay it back the debt later unused for any specific project or operation, or just use it to do share buybacks to pump their stock.It‚Äôs better to have a low interest line of credit than not, just to keep options and operations open.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 15:22:53'] For quite a bit of that time, borrowing money was pretty close to free, and much preferable to repatriating their offshore capital.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 15:58:48'] Borrow money at low rates, then buy back shitload of shares. Free money

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:08:05'] Possibly a lot of money overseas they don‚Äôt want to bring back and get taxed on.  Many companies just use it as collateral and borrow money on it to save the tax hit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 18:51:25'] To line Buffet's pockets so he can dump it on retail
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 00:30:21'] So, like, some people on here are totally not thinking straight when it comes to AAPL and thinking everything will just keep going up and up.>Well, as we look for companies to invest in, we always keep an eye out for those that possess what we call a "moat" - that is, a competitive advantage that helps them maintain their profitability and market position over time. And one sign of a truly great company is that it has the ability to fund its own growth and operations without needing to rely on outside sources of capital.>So, if you're asking me what I think makes a truly wonderful company, I would say that it's one that has built up such a strong position in its industry that it doesn't need to turn to the capital markets for funding, whether it's for growth or simply to stay afloat. That kind of financial strength is a sign of a business that is truly built to last.---- Warren Buffett in ASM, 2000Sure, borrowing money can be cheaper than selling off part of the company, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. When a company borrows money, they gotta pay it back with extra interest. That eats into their profits and makes it harder to reach their goals.AAPL has been growing super fast and has an edge over the competition, but let's be real, no company can just keep growing forever without facing some problems. Taking on debt is always a bit risky, 'cause it can mess with future cash flow and make it harder to pay back the debt during a downturn, which could hurt the company's value. And if something bad happens to the whole industry or just AAPL, it could be way worse than anyone expects.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:13:42'] Leverage?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:23:28'] The main reason as other people have already said is that they don't want to repatriate their cash from other countries so they borrow money to avoid having to pay taxes. The other reason is the apple credit card and other apple credit products allows them to convert their AAA rating bonds into a higher yield when they loan it back out. They have a lot of things that make them sorta bank like though they aren't going all in on being a bank...yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:53:50'] Because it was at 0% interest (or very near)    Watch this space.  Next year will show a different tactic.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 18:13:01'] Yeah, if you have good credit, you can finance at incredibly low rates and then pay back with inflated dollars later. it's a huge gainer, so long as you can maintain cashflow.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 18:14:58'] I haven‚Äôt looked at the financials, but I also presume they‚Äôve been doing significant share buybacks which would increase the debt to equity ratio without increasing debt.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 19:10:21'] If you have over 10m gross value, borrowing money is cheaper than using your money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 19:14:38'] Cheap money. Borrow at 2% and buyback shares that increase the share price by 4% annually. I wish they had taken out more cheap debt.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 19:18:31'] Buybacks
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 19:59:34'] They make a lot of money outside the US.  If they bring it back here it gets taxed.  However, if they use it as collateral and take out loans / sell bonds with low rates, they can spend the money freely.  It financial games.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 21:10:10'] Tax purposes?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 23:42:21'] Didn‚Äôt read the whole thread so not sure if already mentioned but another important reason is that a lot of apples cash is overseas, bringing that to the US would trigger tax on it. Therefore debt is cheaper, especially during the low interest times:)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 03:33:03'] Probably because money was so incredibly cheap.  Why not?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 04:08:02'] They would put the money they have in to R&D and investments in other companies, then use money they financed cheaper than the ROI in to share buybacks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 06:53:33'] It‚Äôs because much of AAPL‚Äôs cash is stashed in offshore tax havens and Apple cannot repatriate it without paying tax. Same concept as a billionaire paying their expenses with loans backed by assets, rather than generating taxable income. It‚Äôs tax avoidance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 07:56:42'] Look at the cash flow statement for share buybacks. AAPL does not need to borrow to fund operations or R&D. All the borrowing is to buyback shares. Shares outstanding have declined from 21B in 2016 to 16B.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 07:57:09'] Money was worth more invested at basically free interest rates. A lot of companies and people did that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 11:45:05'] Did u also have a look at their cash position? It bleeds into Debt, they've shrunk it down slowly while raising Net Debt.  And as others noted, Debt is cheaper than equity
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:42:21'] all the people saying 'free money' are clueless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 20:43:38'] For those curious‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre making money whether they try to act like they‚Äôre not. Everything you buy, they‚Äôre getting SOMETHING. you pay it all? Great. You don‚Äôt? Even better! Now you‚Äôre in debt and most companies would charge late fees extra. But the best part comes when they get to sell that debt to debt collectors. Either way this is literally designed to put people in debt. Stop living above your means people. Instead of paying four payments.. just out that money away and save up. Do you really think APPLE is doing people a favor here? No. It‚Äôs a get money scheme. They know people will spend far above their means and end up owing more. You‚Äôre incentivized to purchase above your means. ‚ÄúOh you can buy that couch instead of that cheaper one, because you get to pay it off. Well, since we can make payments let‚Äôs get those expensive lamps too‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:40:00'] Probably closer to the iPad or Watch. People who like it will be pretty into it, but a much narrower market, even if a consumer-level model comes out, and not an essential device like a PC or Smartphone.People like a smart watch. If a smart watch gets broken or lost, you have a bad day, but you get over it and can go without ever replacing it. If a smart phone gets broken or lost, you pretty much lose a huge portion of what you can do in life until it gets replaced.The Vision is going to resemble much more of the watch's importance than the phone's. It will probably have a place in people's lives as a side grade to a PC or home entertainment system.That being said, Apple stock is going to continue to go up. The Vision wont bankrupt Apple or be a failed product, but it also wont be the next game changer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:40:57'] Its first generation and the first is usually more expensive. There is actually a video of the Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laughing at the iPhone when it was first announced by Steve Jobs. He says something along the lines of ‚Äú$500!!!!!! For a phone!‚Äù All while laughing. Sort of like the reactions today. This product right now is definitely not mean‚Äôt for the average consumer hence the name Pro. I think overtime like the iPhone it will eventually evolve and become more affordable and way more useful. They just needed to get the ball rolling.Edit: I actually got curious and decided to find the video. It‚Äôs crazy looking back how wrong he was and other people were too. Its just something we are going to have to wait and see play out over multiple years to see how successful it will be. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U&pp=ygUUc3RldmUgYmFsbG1lciBpcGhvbmU%3D
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:55:09'] iPhone was massively successful because it‚Äôs practical and doesn‚Äôt completely kill your bank for the average consumer. This is not practical. This is a dead end gimmick and it‚Äôs too expensive. It won‚Äôt be an iPhone moment. None of my neckbeard iOS lovers are interested in buying this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:01:43'] Something I have yet to hear from anywhere is that the key to this release is the Pro in the name. Clearly they see this as a premium product that has cutting-edge tech. I believe that this was released first to get developers on board and hype up the product. $3500 isn‚Äôt going to be a mass sale device. But a toned down version in the next 10 yrs will be much more affordable. I can see the price cuts following the Watch trajectory. Now you can buy one for $200 brand new.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 15:30:37'] india is very price sensitive market and 400+$ phones made only 3% of total smartphone market. Earlier apple didn't really take india seriously indian premium smartphone market was dominated by OnePlus. Plus iphones were produced in China and costed a heavy import duty. Few years ago apple started manufacturing in India and got to save on the import duty, this allowed them to be competitive at pricing, especially during sales. Plus average price of Android smartphones started going up. Fall of OnePlus and premium image of apple has allowed it to become most popular expensive phone and do record sales here. Hence apple has started taking india seriously due to the growth potential.

It sells stuff that's been made but makes it white (when back in the days this colour was cheap) and made a profit. It's a cult. It's got a cult following. People will buy just for the name.It's no different from people buying a certain brand of trainers or brand of car or burger.It's successful because it's got a following....innovative or not. For some reason, people follow. By the way, I don't own the stock or any of its products.I'm sure if the company started selling the fruit - apples and put it's logo on it. People will just buy it daily.I forgot to add. You have to admit this. The camera or photos from an iPhone are much better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 16:34:27'] Dear esteemed readers, allow me to elucidate upon the situation at hand with regard to Apple's recent VR headset launch and its impact on the company's stock prices. Despite the highly anticipated nature of this event, it would appear that the actual product failed to meet the lofty expectations of investors and analysts alike. The KeyBanc analyst in question, Mr. Nispel, has astutely observed that the hype surrounding the launch was indeed well overdone, resulting in a sell-the-news event that caused a decline in Apple's stock prices. It would seem that the Vision Pro headset is a case of style over substance, as it is both costlier than anticipated and lacking in the advanced features that were promised by Apple. This has led to a significant disconnect between the perceived value of the product and its actual utility, which has understandably caused investors to lose confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises. It is therefore incumbent upon Apple to address these concerns and provide a more compelling value proposition for its VR headset if it wishes to regain the trust of its investors and customers. In doing so, the company must also be mindful of the increasing competition in the VR market, as well as the rapidly evolving technological landscape that is constantly reshaping consumer expectations. In conclusion, while Apple's recent VR headset launch was undoubtedly a significant event, it would appear that the actual product failed to live up to the hype surrounding it. This has led to a decline in the company's stock prices, which serves as a cautionary tale for future product launches and highlights the importance of delivering on promises and meeting customer expectations.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:57:11'] I switched to iPhone and I personally think that the phones just invest quality in the right places. One of the big switching points for me was the camera - I used to have (and love!!!) a Pixel but I think it has just fallen off in quality, and though the iPhone camera hardware is not technically impressive, the software pulls all the right tricks to make pictures simply look better, imo.Enough has been said about the ecosystem but its true. Its nice that Apple products work really well together. One particular favorite of mine is how they have improved upon bluetooth which can otherwise be a rather finicky standard. Airplay, Airdrop, etc. seem to work closer to expectation. iPhone to iPhone functionality like iMessage is an absolute *dream*.Even though *Im sure it is bleeding like a siv anyway*, I appreciate Apple‚Äôs stance on customer privacy.Also very subjective but in my experience they tend to last longer and stay healthier in general.I can understand that if I had different use-cases, I would want an Android, but these are just some of my reasons. It has cons! I vehemently oppose Apple‚Äôs stance on the Right to Repair, and some things *can* feel disappointingly proprietary. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be going back anytime soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:27:16'] My only reason for switching to iPhone 2+ years ago was, that in my region Google Wallet was not available and Android Auto was working wired mode only. Switched to iPhone, everything just works out of the box, without rooting. Integrations with other devices are flawless on Apple ecosystem. Doesn't mean that iPhone doesn't have any flaws, there are things that drive me crazy, but it just works. Back in 2020 when I switched from Samsung, they were shipping in Europe with inferior CPU, battery life and resale value that degrades faster than a teenager getting drunk for the same price as iPhone. Not to mention the device life of Android has 2-3 years of software updates, where Apple keeps 6.  So it was a no brainer for me.Might give Android a try again someday, but I am comfortable with the iPhone that can last me at least another 2 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 04:16:57'] I refuse to be bullied into buying a more expensive phone simply because Apple intentionally makes certain features incompatible with android phones. They are aware of the issues OP mentioned and actively lean into them to increase their sales.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 09:42:43'] It is an anecdotal experience, but nevertheless, my experience is that people switch from Android to Apple products far more often than vice versa. And another anecdotal observation I've made is that Apple seems to be far more successful at cross selling and people using Apple products often buy into their services (for example iCloud, Apple Music, etc) and hardware (iPads, Macbooks, iWatch etc) than Android users. Which is one of the reasons why I think that despite being a mature company Apple still has bright future ahead of them and they represent a sizeable portion of my portfolio.

Keep that stock forever (make sure divvies are being reinvested - AAPL restarted paying a dividend in 2013) and never sell.I also bought AAPL in 2011 and have never sold.  In fact I still buy on the 1st of every quarter like clockwork.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 03:37:20'] I think content creation is really there to add value to their products. Netflix has 31.6bn revenue and Apple has 394.3bn revenue.Chasing the competitive streaming dollars is such a poor use of cash. But driving more product sales and bringing people into the Apple ecosystem is far more profitable.Netflix would rather sell $1000 devices every 2 years than collecting $7 per month that can be shared by multiple people and cancelled anytime.

If they can invest this successfully and grow their Apple TV subscription base this can be a massive win for them. I heard they got some good content on there too but I think the main issue is there is not a lot compared to other streaming platforms. This could help fix that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 05:43:01'] This is the way. All steaming platforms should adopt this model, just makes sense. Have your big movies get a huge pop in theaters, let word of mouth spread the hype to the losers who think they are too cool to go see a movie in theaters and you will gain users organically. Apple TV has a small, but GREAT library of original content. They just need to general public to discover it

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 17:35:46'] Investors are morons, but not nearly as much as the expert analysts. People can't gasp on the simple fact that this is a "product" in line of products. Apple didn't redefine the company. Price wise, I get the comments, but I kinda don't really. Is it expensive relative to what? $3,500 is not cheap, but also, It probably cost apple around $2,800 landed.  Why? Becuase the technology is mind-blowing. The sensors and neuroengineering ML built in look as smooth as you can get. From the outline, it is damn fine piece of technology. If you are at any level interested in tech, this is a must watch product, and the sky is the limit. What happens next? in 3-5 years, it probably gonna get cheaper. Awful design? I heard that on every iPhone and accesory Apple released since 2014. Rememebr when they removed the headphone jack and released the first AirPods? Remember the memes? Then remember how many people in your own circle ended up buying the new phone and airpod? How about the Watch? Remember, who is going to buy this garbage? 100s of millions did  The AR/VR set look weird because its unusual, and by no means I think its the future, or near-term future, but it will be something used by a group of users, especially creative userbase. Apple selling 1M or 5M units from this set in the first 2 years ain't moving the needle. Apple making 1B to 3.5B in Net Income from this ain't changing the valuation, and I can't stress on how stupid it is to assume this product is changing the structure or profitability of Apple. Apple is setting the industry standard right now, and the sky is the limit for developers. That being said, literally this is as catalyst as apple released a new season of Ted Lasso. It is pointless. If this product generates 1B in NI a Q for Apple, that is NOTHING. If you buy Apple, its for the ecosystem, brand loyalty, and earning power; not AR set. Apple will keep selling shit load of Phones, Tables, Macs, and Accessories, and nothing changing that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:45:06'] What makes me bullish on Apple is their service division. Over 1.5 billion people use an Apple product. Think about how much money they can pull from that pool and if they continue to grow their ecosystem that opportunity will only increase. On top of it their service business is really high margin too. The whole AR/VR stuff is just icing on the cake. If it works out‚Ä¶..great. If it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.oh well.I did like their new MacBooks. The MacBook Air looks really great. Also I love how they just kept taking shots at Intel throughout the show lol.

POST_TEXT: b"Apple's recent financial performance and position in the AI industry have raised some red flags. Despite generating significant revenue, Apple's gross margin percentage has seen a decline, and its heavy spending on share buybacks might suggest a lack of better investment opportunities.  \nAdditionally, while Apple has been investing in AI, they seem to be falling behind. Their acquisitions in the field haven't yet translated into significant progress, which may suggest difficulties in integrating these acquisitions or a lack of strategic focus.  \nIt's crucial for us to keep a critical eye on these developments. What are your thoughts"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:10:35'] Apple is a big boat and very slow to course correct. But when they do, they rarely chase and instead typically navigate the boat to where they believe a product / market is going to be, or where they think a product / market should be.E.g. burning CDs‚Ä¶ eh, they missed that market, let‚Äôs just sell a device where you never have to swap a CD, ever again, and get in on what goes onto that device. Thus iTunes and the iPod.

About on par with the iPhone, the Web and PCs before that. It really feels like they (and Google and Amazon) bet on the wrong horse with their AI types. Though, to be fair to them and the rest of the world, almost no one knew LLM would be this useful and Siri/Alexa/GA have a different role to fill (practical, narrow field).As a shareholder, I‚Äôm not sure WWDC is going to bring us what we need, but as a fan I‚Äôm really curious about what their solution to VR/AR(?) is going to be. But I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not going to be as much of an ‚Äúof course!‚Äù feeling as the iPhone was.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 02:21:14'] Without significant AI development (and there really is none at Apple that could compare to what Microsoft, Meta and Google have been doing) Apple's future in the personal computing world does not seem so bright anymore.

This year that release was delayed to Q1 this year plus people dont update laptops as often as their phones. iphone drop was expected with disappointing Iphone 14/Max upgrades and shortage of pro phones in Q4. I hope they elucidate during earnings call as to if some of that sales would happen in Q1 having better than normal Q1 sales. I think its time Apple stops its incremental tiny upgrades and tries something big. Their products are so well made and performant that people have slowed down their upgrades. Plus I am hearing AR/VR glasses may be delayed. So no new catalyst for this year. That said looking at how passionate the Apple fanbase is, I am not selling my stock at all.

All the other Apple product metrics just simply do not drive the stock price.  I don't see the iPhone or the resultant ecosystem going out of favor any time soon.  Apple will be a strong stock going forward because people will continue buying and upgrading to new Iphones into the indefinite future.

I expect slower revenue growth over the next 3-5 years of 4-5% and margins going back to around 22% but should buy back 4-5% of their shares per year. $90 would still be above their 2020 high.In terms of the blue chip tech stocks I currently see better value in Google, Amazon, and Meta, so I see no reason to overpay for Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 15:17:43'] As many others will point out, do your own research and make your own evaluations.  That being said, to your question, I'm not hopping on board the AAPL train anytime soon.Couple of reasons - their debt/equity ratios are high, on the levels one would expect to see for companies like F and other auto manufacturers.  Whereas said manufacturers have a high degree of assets (resulting in reasonable P/B ratios), AAPL is crazy-high at nearly 40:1.  By contrast, a lot of other high-growth startups are in the 5-15 range, if memory serves right.If share equity gets wiped out, the debt/equity ratio is going to end up very high, which to me says they're generating a lot of their growth and financing operations via debt.  If that's the case, then with current conditions and high interest rates, those debts could start to drag down operations some time in the future.  In short, it feels too much like a house of cards to me, where it's being invested to as the world's savings account, rather than warranting the price it has by its own merits.There are lots of arguments to buy it - solid brand loyalty, high brand recognition, regular wear and tear plus new features driving people to buy new phones, having them expand into other markets like wearables, entertainment, etc...  But I don't think that I'd buy it anytime soon.  If I was holding onto any stock from the early days, I'd personally sell while the going is good.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 14:56:10'] i mean the market cap is still 2 trillion. Which IMO is crazy. they do make 400 billion in revenues which is bonkers. But i do not think their process of charging 15-30% tax on everything on app store will last for very long. That is almost pure profit and so many gov are looking at it as abuse of power. So many of their big companies who have apps are already pissed at it. Again looking at the market cap it has more room to fall then go up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 23:17:34'] Ask your uncle and/or cousins how/where he bought the stock, and if he has any records, account numbers, etc. When you get your check, is there a brokerage name on it? If it‚Äôs housed at a major brokerage, then it might just be easier to open yours there, or you could have them transferred to another brokerage.

There are a few contributing factors.\n\nThe company couldnt build enough of its high-end iPhones when its primary assembly facility in China was shut down for weeks during Covid lockdowns. Customers in many regions noticed as early as November that Apple couldnt promise Christmas delivery of a new iPhone.\n\nApple gave a rare warning to investors that month explaining that production issues would result in lower shipments than previously anticipated.

POST_TEXT: b"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity\n\nOver the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buy"
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:16:25'] The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:47:57'] The question around Apple is how can it maintain high growth if it has become so big?  Eventually it will get to a point where even if they make new products that are highly profitable, because they are so big already that may translate into single digit growth.  They would need monster success from new capital deployed just to keep up a modest growth rate.It does look like Apple still has a lot of growth potential though.  They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:42:38'] MSFT - I think they have an incredible MOAT. In my opinion,  their offerings are the most iron clad relative to economic conditions. Their investment in OpenAI only makes me that much more excited about future possibilities.Having said that? These are all amazing companies. I just feel MSFT is more focused than both GOOGL and AMZN while thinking that their basket of products/services is more diverse than AAPLs in respect to both b2b and b2c value.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 10:12:50'] Out of those three I would say Microsoft. Best diversification, best moat, and has segments that are crucial to government operations meaning it‚Äôs backed by the government to the extent of they won‚Äôt let Microsoft fail. Apple is very dependent on hardware sales since that is how they get users into their ecosystem. And as for their hardware comparable alternatives are available creating some risk there. All it takes is a few missteps on the hardware side for Apple to crack. Amazon e-commerce is low margin but they do have AWS which is high margin.  Overall amazons success weighs heavy on AWS. Amazon does have data on users like shopping habits and previous purchases to help drive ad sales. Microsoft products are heavily integrated into most people lives to the point where there is no real comparable alternative and these offerings are through so many different segments. This is why I would say Microsoft is the strongest of the three. As for the mega cap with the biggest upside I would say alphabet as of right now. They have multiple growth segments like cloud, AI, driverless tech, healthcare, search, YouTube, and so much more. On top of it they are trading at the lowest valuation of all the mega caps right now. But to the original question Microsoft for sure in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:05:00'] This is a tough choice. MSFT is the best value of the 3 currently and has a nice dividend for the tech space. And all three choices aren‚Äôt going away IMO.However, if I had to pick one, I‚Äôd go with AMZN. You‚Äôve got Walmart, CVS and Alphabet rolled into one conglomerate with AMZN. The logistics tentacles that the company has cast a wide moat alone, not to mention its other diversified operations.The only thing I don‚Äôt love about AMZN is the P/E ratio currently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:50:21'] First, those 3 companies are great and I have been tracking them to invest when their valuations are better.  Basically, I am waiting until their P/Es are favorable which means MSFT needs to be at $200 and AAPL needs to be between $100 - $110.  Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.All of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.The one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.  I think I'll be investing in GOOGL before the others solely based on valuation and how fast the stocks get to fair value.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 17:14:47'] I‚Äôve done a DCF for both AMZN and GOOG, do note I particularly love AMZN so take into account the slight subtle bias in my conclusion personally I wouldn‚Äôt put all my money into 1 stock because if one day FedEX/UPS and WMT decides to collaborate against AMZN I‚Äôm not really sure how well AMZN can hold up against them, given that the AMZN store business right now is still in a growing phase looking to cut costs through economies of scales, there is a possibility they may never be profitable enough to generate free cash flow but I like my odds on that.AMZN does have things going for it like AWS, it right now is the biggest player in the cloud space and is actually the one generating free cash flows for the firm. Advertising is one of their most recent venture in 2019, not much information was given on it but seems like cash for basically no additional costs. Word of caution for AMZN though, AMZN has been in negative free cash flows for the past 2 years. Reason given by management is because they‚Äôve doubled their network focusing more on growth, profits later. If you like their mantra you could consider digging more into AMZNAs for GOOG, 80% of their revenue comes from advertising. Advertising is a cyclical business. Meaning when the economy tanks, GOOG goes down with it as well.The good thing about GOOG is that it‚Äôs a software company so the main bulk of cost should come from R&D there shouldn‚Äôt be very high costs required to maintain the servers, so once products get through GOOG just has to wait on cash to flow in, their margins have been consistently 20+% for the past 5-6 years compared to AMZN‚Äôs 2-5% iirc.The most exciting thing for GOOG is that it‚Äôs looking to break into different modal for search. If tech is more of your thing GOOG would probably be your best bet.I know you asked about AAPL, MSFT and AMZN but I haven‚Äôt had a look at AAPL and MSFT so Iwouldn‚Äôt want to feed you misinformation.

Sending sales into the stratosphere. They have not announced any layoffs yet while the other two companies combined plan to lay off like 30000 people.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 18:08:04'] Consider this an assessment more of how these stock tickers will do, not how good the companies are, or their businesses are...AAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.But AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.We've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on "metaverse" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.  They didn't change or fix anything.  They just waited for the spotlight to move.Tesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.Nvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from selling wildly overpriced silicon for unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.Netflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.So while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying datafeed entries of third party offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large "tech" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position for senseless rebound.

Source: APTesla Model SThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects".Berlin, D√ºsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is "serious defects in driving comfort and safety", including unwanted braking.As far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term "Autopilot".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:09:04'] I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. Now, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.Other brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.Other brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.Other brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.The last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.Tesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units.

When in fact he's out there personally trying to put out fires due to Tesla FSD and auto pilot being so darn awful official government agencies have to go after him and sit him down like a child who knew full well what he was doing was wrong in the first place, and sit him down and scold him and ground him and give Elon Musk a consequence for his negative behavior. Like a child! lol.The number of times Tesla and Elon Musk have been involved in covering up or reducing the seriousness of the issues and problems regarding the public safety and driver safety with his cars on the road probably should be taken into account at some point once enough accidents/deaths have occurred to make the information seem more prevalent, like what is the difference between a transparent company and Tesla?A transparent company has no secrets.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple Inc. is eliminating a small number of roles within its corporate retail teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking its first known internal job cuts since it embarked on a belt-tightening effort last year. \n\nThe company is shedding positions in what it calls its development and preservation teams, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasnt been announced. Those groups are responsible for the construction and upkeep of Apple retail stores and other facilities around the world.\n\nWhile the number of positions being eliminated couldnt be ascertained and is likely very small, the move represents a new step for the worlds most valuable company, whose peers have been slashing their ranks in the face of a shaky economy and sluggish consumer spending.\n\nApple is positioning the move as a streamlining effort, rather than layoffs.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html\n\nPalantirs boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.\n\nHe added, without naming anyone, that this is because people who have nothing to offer want to study AI, but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversarie'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:56:07'] I mean, it was painfully obvious right from the start because they asked to "stop it, at least for six month". That at least for six months part is like very funny and giving away. They weren't ready, they had nothing to offer and they tried to use gullible virtue signaling public to give themselves a fighting chance. They failed. It's important to remember these people never about the public. They would obliterates millions or billions of people if it benefitted them, which they passively doing every day. They don't give a flying fuck about doomsday or any of that bullshit. They are the doomsday. Them and their infinite greed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 07:28:32'] This is what I was thinking during the Nvidia rally. The only thing that actually happened is ChatGPT and it happened in November. It's June now. In the vast majority of cases, pouring years of manual labor and $gigazillions of compute resources into AI will not result in something profitable.Generative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.Palantir dude is right. And Altman, Woz and Musk alike know the government isn't capable of stopping AI just like they're not capable of stopping drugs or FOSS. They're focused squarely on their respective corporate agendas.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 08:11:08'] I mean... if you actually do more than read headlines, you're going to realize this is exactly what people are warning about.It's like nuclear weapons. The other people have it, we have better ones...but eventually they will want more too, so we gotta keep developing stronger nukes. You need to escalate because the "enemy" will..... The whole point is that the race is already here. We're in it. But that's exactly where the danger is. If you look in popular fiction like Terminator you will see a General hook up Skynet to all military systems and cause the apocalypse. You think wow that's really dumb why would you do that... But what if AI managed flight plans save billions of dollars or dozens of lives? What if giving AI access to optimize your data center means you will save billions compared to your competitors? If you don't do it your competitor will.There will always be people who are chasing efficiency and profit wanting to push the boundaries of AI.The only way out of this arms race is to agree together to be careful. It's exactly like the nuclear non proliferation treaties... not that that has fully prevented countries like North Korea from developing more nukes. It will likely be really hard to get the same consensus for AI, since denying a country AI could have serious disadvantages economically.It's a really hard problem. We might be in an unstoppable incentive structure to...well Skynet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:43:13'] What's scary is that he is right. The current war has showcased that with good intels from big data analysis, and 15x artillery launchers, a small country can defend itself.  Right now, RU is doing everything to slow down the Ukrainian expected counter attack, from bombing power plants to destroying dam.  And it looks like the special intels that are being generated with the PLTR platform are very useful since the US spec ops department wanted in as well.  If Ukraine somehow wins this war then it will mean more countries will want the same PLTR platform.  There is already an AI and super computer arm race with China, so that will force the US to continue to fund billions into PLTR because every AI companies are too far behind to catch up.  It is such a weird company.  In theory, it should be valued more since the world western governments will soon be outsourcing PLTR into everything based on this war.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 12:52:21'] AI is absolutely NOT comparable to crypto; these "bubble" parallels make absolutely no sense.AGI, the thing we are afraid of, is at least an order of magnitude out of reach. There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything "live and organic and thinking". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).AI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain "skilled labor positions" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a "regular" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.But if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a "untrained" AI.If I'm McDonalds, AI is very welcome. The big mac is coming out the same every time. If I'm a 3* michelin star restaurant, AI simply has no place.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 15:49:10'] Honestly I don't get this shit at all. I can say "ok google" and ask for whatever, and my phone pulls it up the best it can. This feature has been around for several years. So now I'm suppose to ask Bing to do the exact same thing? Why?  I must be missing what this AI crap actually is, because it seems like useless hype for shit nobody is gonna use....like Samsungs version of Siri.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 09:11:42'] If Apple needs to create their own search engine they are screwed. Just look at how bad Siri is. Bing also took years before it became usable. The moat is very big when it comes to search engines.And regarding the payment: i think that Goog ans MSFT are smart enough not to outbid each other and waste money that goes to Apple
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 23:58:36'] Apple is likely to die first among these 3. Mobile phones are more powerful now, no one needs to change a phone every year now. Apple needs to expand their business. Phone sales are tough. Pixel and Samsung phones are catching up too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 06:01:36'] These chatbots are a gimmick right now. Useful for certain things, but mostly a toy. As people become aware of their limitations, and how inaccurate they can be, the novelty will wear off. I think we are far away from this technology having a meaningful impact on these businesses.And although this might be naive of me, I have a very hard time believing a company like Alphabet wasn't fully aware of this as a potential threat to their business model. They've been working on AI themselves for years. Do you think nobody in the company thought, "Hey guys, if AI gets integrated into search, that could hurt our search business."My take on this whole thing? Alphabet hasn't been in any rush with AI because they know how complicated it is and they want to do it right. When they saw the release of ChatGPT and then Microsoft do their thing, they mistakenly rushed something out to show they're working on it too. It was more of a PR blunder than anything else. What they should have done was taken the high road by explaining the flaws in other companies' products, why it is such a complicated technology, and reassure their investors that what they eventually reveal will blow their minds.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 20:04:02'] "Apple can just create their own search engine" which they could do... if they could.  It's just like how Apple Maps is just nowhere near as good as Google Maps or even Bing Maps.  Apple was forced to bend over and allow Google Maps back on their devices.With Search AI these search engines are going to get so complicated that Apple won't be able to just replicate it, they'll be forced to sign on.  There's really only two underlying search engines in the world.  Google makes one, Bing makes one.  Every other engine is based on either one.  Google represents a little over 90% of all searches.  So they're not going to get beat by better technology at this point.  In order for Chrome to become the most popular browser it required the US government to force Microsoft to give them their data and to not compete.I think BardAI's presentation not going well is going to mean Google isn't going to be able to "defend" against this.  The fact that BardAI in their presentation just gave false information is pretty bad.  I think people will be pretty excited to play with ChatGPT on Bing and I think it'll cause some people to permanently convert over to it.  I could see Bing being up to 20% of all searches in the next two years.I think the big thing with ChatGPT is that it's really really far ahead of the rest.  It's going to be incredibly useful in Microsoft Office (which is a major product for Microsoft).  I think Apple is honestly hooped.  They haven't really had a successful new product for a while and it'll be a few years of R&D before they'll be able come up with their next big seller.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 21:04:26'] So apple will have to either pay Google or Microsoft for their AI or build something from scratch.  In either case apple is losing money, so how is apple winning here?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 23:00:54'] Most of the internet is supported by ads. Not just Google, but most free websites that create content and host information make money through ads based on traffic to their website. If people get used to just reading a summary answer from a chatbot and stop actually visiting the website where the information comes from, then the website will go out of business. The these bots will eventually have no information to build off of to answer questions. That is not a good place for any search engine to be in.

Most of this is improvement in Bing although some of it is a decline in the quality of Google with its more obvious focus on advertising.I'm not saying MSFT will surpass Google in the near term, but I can see it significantly cutting into their market share.

POST_TEXT: b'NEEDHAM, Mass., January 25, 2023  Worldwide smartphone shipments declined 18.3% year over year to 300.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2022 (4Q22), according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. The drop marks the largest-ever decline in a single quarter and contributed to a steep 11.3% decline for the year. 2022 ended with shipments of 1.21 billion units, which represents the lowest annual shipment total since 2013 due to significantly dampened consumer demand, inflation, and economic uncertainties. This tough close to the year puts the 2.8% recovery expected for 2023 in serious jeopardy with heavy downward risk to the forecast.\n\n"We have never seen shipments in the holiday quarter come in lower than the previous quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 08:51:23'] Not too surprising. Companies tried to hike prices for worse products in the last cycle.  E.g. Samsung's flagship S22 actually came with less ram than the S21 in the basic configuration. That's not how technology works.  Also a 3+ year old phone these days still does 99% of what you want just fine, and especially if you're not going to improve it why would I drop $1000 to upgrade?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 09:09:39'] You can't keep hiking prices *and* expect everyone to get a new phone every single year, especially when their old one was perfectly fine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 08:36:04'] They need to innovate. Phones still haven't changed much from the iPhone X and that was what? 2017? That's over 5 years ago now.Samsung are trying to push their flip technology but that's a gimmick that's still not really figured out fully yet, and when you have 4 cameras + 4k at 60fps there's really not that much they could possibly innovate on in the immediate future outside of sci-fi holograms or something. I can see smartphone sales declining for the foreseeable and eventually stagnating. They obviously won't go away too much as people need to replace old phones, but I think we're past the smartphone sales golden age.

Some phones these days are worth more than my old car, and yet one slight fumble and the phone is broken... way to fragile.What about the sham some  new phones making people  go and buy a charger separately once you have spent huge money in the phone itself.... lol  what a joke.No thanks, I won't be buying any new phone as long as my BlackBerry passport is still ticking. I still get over 24 hours charge so I'm still good.Morale of the story here......

POST_TEXT: b'https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/\n\nMeta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebooks parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabets share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.\n\nFour years ago, you wouldnt be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising, said Dischler. '
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 17:21:19'] So there is no more threat of antitrust laws against Alphabet and Meta. No more scrutiny. That‚Äôs good news for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 17:55:43'] It drives me absolutely nuts that Apple was able to achieve this via anti-competitive practices that took market share away from the others. It just blows my mind that Apple doesn't have more scrutiny.  It's just easy pickings to go after very obviously problematic Facebook who are mostly just unaware of the scale of the issues whereas Apple and Google are way more calculated about how they take market share away.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 20:10:13'] Probably not a lot of marketers chiming in here, I have over 20 years in the digital marketing space so I'll add some clarity. 1.) Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   Since search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  Unless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. ...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. Which brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. All that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. Facebook doesn't allow this. Apple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. TikTok doesn't allow this. Amazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.Desktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.&#x200B;2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. This means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. That's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. &#x200B;3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. Which brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. Unfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. ...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. 4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. Apple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) As an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. No because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. Apple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. I see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. These are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. &#x200B;5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. That says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. Facebook has 3 massive problems. 1.) It's too expensive. Costs on par with Google. 2.) It has far lower quality and intent. People aren't searching, they're interrupted with an ad. 3.) Attribution is basically gone. Who clicked what and who converted? Fuck if I know!Facebook in its current iteration stands absolutely no chance at taking Google's marketshare for anything but consumer lawsuits. IF the metaverse becomes of a thing and FB controls that, well, then, they're the biggest thing in the world, right? Can't refute that. But, think about it. There's a reason Zuck pivoted so hard. He knows he lost the ad game and it's just a matter of time. Thanks to Apple, they can't fix their attribution problems so he has to create his own fucking world to monetize. &#x200B;\----In closing. Will Google lose marketshare? Probably not. Maybe to Apple. Still probably not.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 15:29:02'] Apple has a lot of money, and makes  a lot money. even if they were death rattling and your short hypothesis was correct, in the time it took apple to finally die, the stock market would have already imploded and you‚Äôd have other things on your mind besides your apple short.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 17:07:10'] I'm not very optimistic about apple car and just lukewarm on apple glasses.But as Americans get older, they are going to rely on apple home services and apple watch. Apple's at-home gadgets are going to monitor your medical health, entertain you as you get old and fat, make it easier for you to stay in your own house instead of a old folks home, and eventually connect you to some kind of metaverse. I would not bet against that as I think Apple is just as good (and perhaps better) suited to dominate this "Boomer + GenX Get Old and Home bound" market in the next 10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 15:08:42'] Are you shorting Apple because you think it's wildly overvalued and will require a correction soon, or because you don't think they'll grow as fast as expected in the future?In the former case, their PE is less than 27 as of today. Not exactly where you'd short a company like Apple. For comparison, UPST reached a PE of 400+, PTON never turned a profit, Nikola is probably just a fraud, RIVN sells as many cars yearly worldwide as your local Kia dealership weekly... those are the companies you short.In the latter case, the market may take years to adjust... if you're right. Apple is one of those companies that you watch from the sidelines if you think they've peaked...
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 16:24:05'] Apple is my largest holding right now so I've been asking myself the same question recently. I feel like the conversation around tech has shifted with the release of ChatGPT from speculating on the metaverse to speculating on AI. I'm more bullish on AI profitability than the metaverse and I don't really know where Apple stands when it comes to AI which concerns me since I know Microsoft and Alphabet are investing heavily in it. The upcoming headset will probably not be a slam dunk out the gate. I think for headsets to make a significant about of money they'll have to be AR devices, not VR and I think were much farther away from that than people assume.On the other hand... it's Apple so I have a hard time betting against them and will probably just sit on my shares.

They don't push their chips into the centre unless they are confident they'll deliver.I remember thinking they had peaked when they hit a 100 billion dollar market cap. How much more could they possibly grow? They'll be replaced by something better. They'll burn money on something dumb. They won't get into China. They won't convince people to buy a new phone that is nearly the same as the old one they've got...And then here we are, a 20x later.Who knows if they'll continue growing, but shorting them is BOLD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 00:58:20'] Apple App Store employs thousands if not tens of thousands of people indirectly. Cloud service revenues are growing and will continue to grow. Streaming service influence. Widespread use in the education system garnering generation after generation of brand loyal apple users. How long are you planning to be short? Sure maybe as we face continued economic headwinds it‚Äôs not a bad idea to short a tech stock, but I have bearish sentiment for the whole market in general.I own apple, so maybe I‚Äôm biased and not seeing what you‚Äôre seeing. But rather than a stagnation ahead, I think Apple has hit the point where it‚Äôs moat is so strong it can now experiment with new ways to garner revenues. Apple is a pretty dynamic and adaptive company, they frequently acquire smaller companies in order to utilize and apply their technologies to their own products. My two cents, but if you do have solid reasons to why you‚Äôre short I‚Äôd love to hear them honestly, please.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 03:16:05'] The thing is, Apple has already won an award in movie making that Netflix hasn‚Äôt yet, which is nuts. I almost wonder if people will like Apple movies more than competitors just because of its brand. However, movies do have a way of tarnishing brands quickly so we will see.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 10:41:05'] I think we‚Äôre about to see a new wave of innovation thanks to AI and Apple will definitely have a role in this space. Particularly, I think voice assistants are about to get incredibly intelligent, on the same level as ChatGPT and Bard - and because it‚Äôs apple, Siri will likely be tailored to each user based on the data in your iCloud. I still have friends that are ditching their android phones and moving to the apple ecosystem. I don‚Äôt expect revenues to explode but even if they hold at this level, Apple will continue share buybacks and grow its EPS in that way, which inevitably raises share value. I‚Äôm not investing for their VR promises as I think this market is still very niche and probably a decade off till it‚Äôs used in every day life. What I am investing in is the continuity of their business as is, because there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs currently over the horizon to stop it. The same can‚Äôt be said for most companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 00:57:13'] mabye they will not grow alot, but do you really want to put them side by side against the dollar and see which ones goes higher overtime?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 01:16:09'] Apple's not one I'd be super excited to be long right now but to be short... a fool's errand if you're expecting a huge crash. This is a company at the peak of its power that continues to peak and still expand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 16:13:17'] I'm not a huge fan of the company. They make over priced crap that is infuriating to use. Of course, I e been saying that for years and everyone else seems to disagree. However, I'd never short a company that generates cash at the levels apple does.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 19:45:20'] You are definitely not an idiot. The one thing I would say is it between now and the 2024 election that if China invade Taiwan you will see Apple stock tank to $30 per share. I hope that never happens. But I do believe that unfortunately the political abyss this country is in that you‚Äôll see China invade Taiwan.

The reason for my post is that motorcycles are a luxury item for most and Harley is one of the most expensive based on cost of entry.     Inventory at dealers rose by thirteen thousand units from the same time in 2021 after they had spent years trying to knock down those numbers. Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.  For a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.  https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   https://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf      I have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more.   Oh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy. Harley is no longer able to economically produce bikes they can use for their own riding academy

POST_TEXT: b"Apple reached today a new all time high of $182.7 in pre-market. Lots of expectations around the WWDC event and their much anticipated VR announcement.\n\nWhat's your personal take on this? Is it just euphoria or is Apple poised to grow even further throughout the rest of the year?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 05:55:11'] Apple is a company I cannot value correctly so I simply leave it as its share in ETFs and no more.Initially, the company seems significantly overvalued. But then I see people taking on 60 month loans to buy the iPhone 13 Pro.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:27:58'] It‚Äôs funny cause most people own apple if they have a 401k.* If you are invested in the SP500 apple is 7-8% (Spy, Voo)* Total US stock fund apple is 6-7% (VTI)* Total World Stock fund apple is 3-4% (VT)So it‚Äôs safe to assume we‚Äôre all holding.

In my head, I just feel like they are overvalued, but they‚Äôve proven time and time again to always be consistently innovating to keep up with tech. I likely won‚Äôt be selling and just will continue to hold to see where this goes. I gave up valuing Apple back in 2019 and have been holding since.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:00:01'] If the stock bump has anything to do with the headset announcement, we're going to see a lot of unhappy people in a few hours. It is pretty much common knowledge at this point that the initial run of headsets will be $3,000 and geared toward developers. Apple have stated that their goal is for AR to replace iPhone in 10 years, but we're probably years away from an affordable AR solution from them (note I said solution, not headset. I remain 100% certain that AR/VR will never be viable as a mass-market product as long as the form factor is a headset)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:11:12'] I'm skeptical that VR/AR will have anything close to mass adoption. Meta did their best and failed.

I don't expect it to sell well.I can't see anyone in business with it, and teens will get laughed at for wearing it around.We'll see a surge of thefts of it.   Too easy to knock off a kid's head and steal it, so that's a no go.    It'll be a device that sits at home with nothing on it.   I highly doubt it'll hit mass market with how ugly  it is and with how obvious it is you're wearing it.Maybe it'll be cool to use for a while.   I just don't see it.Then again we all laughed when the iPad came out...   It did initially sell very well but has since tapered off a lot.

Two quick examples of mine:\n\n1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.\n\n2.

Buying a Tesla has been a game changer for me. I charge at home, so I never have added stops and don‚Äôt spend $800/month on gas anymore. I use the basic autopilot for nearly 2 hours every day. Passing acceleration and driving up hills (I live in the PNW) are cherries on top. I love the car. I also believe the company may be equal to biotech in terms of being absurdly difficult to properly value. There are a number of potential revenue streams (monetizing the app by opening the charging network to other makers, monetizing proprietary charging hardware/hook up, potential ad revenue via app, and a ton of other things), but there‚Äôs also the very real chance that none of those things materialize or fail to be meaningful. There are also Elon‚Äôs Tweets, which have a massive impact on stock price movement. I love my car, but won‚Äôt have direct exposure to the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 09:17:19'] I've been exposed more and more to Apple products in recent years and I am slowly seeing the light. MacBook batteries don't drain, the phones are slick and IOS is slick and the OS equally is slick. It feels like a richer and smoother product compared to windows. There is also native terminal! Its all on face level however. Windows is better, PCs are better, android is better and google is better. But you need a lot of computing knowledge to get there. But overall I can see *why* people buy the products and stay with the products. Tesla has lost all hope from me as a stock holder. All other companies are making EV's , and there is push backs on tesla. Unless they make serious bounds in auto driving there isn't much for Tesla to go. Elon equally name is tainting tesla as a company. He got political and really, even myself, got swept up in his pr campaign when he was first coming around. There is future for tesla for sure. People keep buying them and driving them. But other companies are going to essentially stop teslas growth. Equally, conservatives hate ev's and liberals hate elon...who the hell do you have left?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:49:14'] >I never owned a single Apple productThis is so funny to me, you absolutely think they are overpriced but have never owned one.For phones, the pricing is similar for a similar product. For computers it has always been like that. I have owned Mac's and PC's for 20 years. Mac's always last longer with less issues.The problem is people see a low end PC price and think it compares to a Mac. Look at specs. Mac doesn't make a low end computer.This us vs them for Mac/PC, iPhone/Samsung, XBox/Playstation is so absolutely ridiculous but somehow people believe one is actually better than the other. They are all very comparable.

POST_TEXT: b'Techs Biggest Companies Discover Austerity, to the Relief of Investors\n\nAfter years of expansion and billions in profits, Big Tech is pulling back from its famously lavish spending as a long boom finally ends\n\nFor much of last year, tech companies stumbled. Digital ad sales plunged. E-commerce sputtered. IPhone production stalled. And investors lost faith.\n\nIt was the worst year that the tech industry had experienced on Wall Street since the financial crisis of 2008. **Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta lost a combined $3.9 trillion in market value.**\n\nNow chastened, many tech companies have begun the year by championing a **new and unfamiliar business strategy: austerity.**\n\nIn recent months, several companies have said they are looking for ways to cut costs and eliminate futuristic projects that have become money pits. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have each announced plans to lay off more than 10,000 workers.\n\nIt is an abrupt turn for an industry that became famous '

Salaries for these companies were mostly market.Average employees in Silicon Valley don‚Äôt have private offices.The shuttle busses are to take people from San Francisco to Silicon Valley because no one wants to live in Mountain View or Palo Alto because Silicon Valley is boring AF (and expensive) for the 20 and 30 somethings that are the backbone of these companies.The laundry service was because employees spent so much timeworking and commuting they don‚Äôt have time for it.The extravagance at places like google is often highlighted but I think this is being used as a rhetorical foil to distract folks from the elephant in the room, excessive executive compensation.But that‚Äôs my 2 cents that ain‚Äôt worth shit.

This is especially alarming that the gain obtained in the past got wiped out recently tons of the past gains. Amzn was $172 back 8/20 today left at $103.Meta was $379 back in 8/21 today left at $186.Ntfx was $690 back in 10/21 today remaining at $365It really says very few growth stocks can sustain in growth sector.

POST_TEXT: b'Whenever there\'s a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone\'s thoughts are, "Why did the markets go up/down today?"\n\nAnd there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, "Because there were more buyers than sellers" (or vice versa).\n\nApple\'s earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.\n\nHowever, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don\'t know, but that\'s a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don\'t quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.\n\nSome folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there\'s a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it\'s just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls '

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 12:41:12'] The market is not rational, people buy and sell on emotion.  Short selling distorts the market even more.  That said, now is the traditional time for funds to buy.  My retirement balanced funds sent 12 emails of trades in the last two days.  Apple has plenty of money saved and is growing y/o/y at 8%.  Yes, revenue was down 5%.  That was overlooked or shorts had to cover.  The trend in the market is still down and we are in a classic bear market.  We won‚Äôt know if we are in another bull for a few months, and at first a rally is just a bear market rally, which I am hoping for to close out my swing trades with a profit.  My lifestyle is already set for survival in a bear market and a recession so long term stability for me is not a guarantee but a good probability.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 13:42:26'] The Flight to Safety is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Valuations are stretched heading into a recession. Heck, valuations are stretched even if we weren't heading into a recession. We still haven't seen any loss harvesting or the inevitable pension plan de-risking pull out going into year-end. That will be a show, along with next earnings season after multiple 75bp increases. We've sofar only been \*promised\* lower earnings...wait til it actually happens. And with treasuries, corporate bonds and pref shares paying north of 4% (6%, 8%+) now, a lot of the liquidity leaving the market seeking yield won't be coming back until the recession is over, really over.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 13:20:08'] Bro you need to zoom out a bit.For the past two days AAPL has been dropping because people thought it would follow the rest of big tech and announce poor results, but when it didn't people bought it back.AAPL is currently at $155 while it was at $150 this time last year. I'd say nothing has changed at all, and it is certainly not the drastic picture you are painting.I know because all my Apple RSUs haven't moved in value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 14:39:51'] I hate to say this but Apple is one of the rare corporations that at least pretend to care about the consumer and the consumer experience. Take a look at the rest of FAANG, there is not a day that goes by where they don't try to fuck you over more and more. More ads, higher price points for the same product, all of these things contribute. Apple is no stranger either but they can look further than 1 quarter of profits.

It‚Äôs not hopeless, and there‚Äôs no need to succumb to the market. There‚Äôs always a reason. If you got walloped, there‚Äôs a reason, and learning what it was is the small amount of power you have. Whether because value is temporarily back in vogue because it‚Äôs calm before the storm, whether firms are using their extensive resources to determine that things aren‚Äôt as bad as feared, or whether institutions are purposefully bidding up the market to fuck retail - it doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is being on the right side of the market, and to do that, you need to know why. Some groups were buying heavily today, and you better believe there‚Äôs a damn good reason for it.

No new CPU (unless you'd consider M2 Pro and Ultra as new).iPhones missed, iPads missed, services missed.Why was AMZN killed today? Their guidance which takes FX into account, and assumes the dollar will remain strong. Why wasn't AAPL killed? Because they don't give guidance for over 2 years now, otherwise they would have to give guidance taking FX into account.Think how many companies beat revenue and EPS and then miss guidance and get killed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 14:42:23'] Apple is just the new overnight reverse repo market.  There‚Äôs clearly too much liquidity in the system and it‚Äôs all hiding in Apple.  Retail sees this and some scalp or buy long dated calls but all that does is further drive liquidity up and the market price with it.  Everyone on the planet is either betting on or against Apple (or the S&P which is pretty much 1:1 correlated with Apple these days) so all that liquidity just keeps the market rising higher and higher.  It will crash when people stop betting on it all together and liquidity dries up.  I think today‚Äôs ridiculous moves and this week‚Äôs volatility destroyed the last people betting against the markets - with VIX absolutely demolished every day and finishing way too low for comfort.  The entire market is all in bullish and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not.What you said about this being the most expensive price relative to the Nasdaq, I want to bring up that Apple at its current valuation in terms of DXY strength is even more expensive than its previous ATH.  People think a $150 stock from 3 years ago is the same as a $150 stock today but that‚Äôs not how FOREX and interest rates work.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 14:35:44'] If Amazon can lose 25% in a day, so can Apple. All it takes is one bad earnings or forecasted revenue decline. It is no guarantee that good earnings will continue on forever.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 13:46:47'] I thought the reason for the jump was pretty obvious after the fact (hindsight is fun).  All of the other tech stocks performed horribly and were tanking, and AAPL doing ‚Äúok‚Äù was for some reason a huge sigh of relief and a sign that maybe things aren‚Äôt so bad.But things are bad.  The only reason AAPL beat was because estimates kept getting lowered.  Tech is not in a good place, and when everyone is crowding into the exact same space because it‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, that should be a huge concern.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 14:30:02'] While it's easy to be either unjustifiably pessimistic ("bearish") or irrationally exuberant ("bullish"), I've found that it's far more important for an investor to remain flexible with ones thesis in the face of uncertainty.We've had a garbage year so far in the equity markets. From a probability perspective, the odds of us having a year like this one where we had 3+ red quarters in a row on a month-over-month basis in the S&P500 were 2 in 37 years. This year marks the 3rd time that we've had a period in the S&P where we have had 3 red quarters.During this 37 year time frame, we've seen relatively high interest rates in the 90s (8.25% peak  Fed rates, all the way down to 6%), and yet our markets have proven to be resilient. We also had 2 major drawdown events during this time; the dot-com era that resulted in a 44.82% peak month-to-month (MtM) drawdown, and the subprime crisis that resulted in a 50.97% drawdown. Prior to that, we did have a period in 1987 which had a 29.78% drawdown. This year, when we were down around 25%, I had called out that we have a low probability of additional downside being greater than 10-15%, for a total drawdown of 35-40%.Although some people are surprised by the moves up lately, I would argue that the market is still functioning within historical tolerances and probabilities. Whether or not we continue this ascent is anyone's guess. We have some headwinds coming near-term (inflation is still stubbornly high), but also some tailwinds which will help push stocks further (e.g. reducing corporate tax rates will be back on the agenda depending on the outcome of the mid-terms in 2 weeks).The best thing that an individual investor can do is stick with their plan. If something isn't working with your investment thesis, change it.Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 14:32:01'] >However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.$AAPL's single day gains beat today's (7.56%) several times within the last 3 years (granted, due to COVID volatility, but people around these parts have short memories...) * 3/24/20: 10.03%* 3/13/20: 11.98%* 3/2/20 - 9.31%Also, I think you're looking at P/E incorrectly - I'm pretty sure you're comparing historic earnings (P / LTM Earnings). Stock prices don't price in historical info, only future.>There is currently a bubble in "safe" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). **Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E**. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a "flight to safety" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.If you [look at this chart](https://imgur.com/a/YdTGDV7), you'll see what I mean - top half is NTM P/E and bottom half is LTM P/E

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 13:29:18'] Yeah the move in apple is crazy.  I actually thought their earnings was kinda disappointing.  8% earnings increase when inflation is higher than that means earnings are down.  Profit up only 1% means profit was down a lot.  My only explanation is that everyone thought that Apple was going to do way worse and had tons of short dated puts in place.  After all those puts became worthless, a gamma squeeze happened.  But that's just speculation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 15:31:26'] I mean it was practically a record breaking earnings for Apple. They have absolutely crushed it while their competitors floundered. They deserve heavy investing because their team has stewarded the business extremely successfully during some wonky economic times. Another thing that, I think, added to the green wave was several underlying companies (big oil for starters) also crushed their earning expectations.

Us, or even big ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô and ‚Äòtraders‚Äô have 0 effect on price action as our order flow is bought, held, controlled and delayed. Market makers have all been fined 50+ times for order delay fraud and front running trades.

It is all controlled by market makers who control the bulk of order flow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 16:21:38'] I believe you are right about the flight to safety effect on the valuation of most value style companies, but Altria is pretty much valued like British American Tobacco and even cheaper than PM at 15 PE (efficiently so considering the bad investments and no main vape line) . You are looking at GAAP earnings which during the write down of juul crushes earnings. Non GAAP earnings (which I wouldn't use in most circumstances) is about 9.7. Those are pretty much the actual underlying earnings of the business aside from irregular costs/losses/investments, since things are wrapping up with juul the next quarters GAAP and non-GAAP puts it very close between 9 and 10 p/e.  So basically yeah they have been eating shit on JUUL but having cut that off (non-compete agreements, losing votes and control but holding a stake) recently I think its pretty irrelevant. It seems to be valued with its peers despite needing some new plays.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 20:14:13'] If Steve Jobs was still alive, Apple would own Disney. Iger has stated that.   Apple and Disney have always had a close relationship.  Iger and jobs were good friends and Iger was on apples board.  Apples ex-number two man, Jonny Ive helped design some of the Disney stores.   Steve Jobs was the largest shareholder in Disney (his ex-wife currently is).        This isn‚Äôt a rumor about two companies coming together is a rumor about two friends coming together
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 16:21:41'] It's speculation.But there are some arguments in favor of it.Disney is having a very difficult time now and is having problems remaining cash positive.  They're down 44% from last year in cash on hand.  Their theme park business is starting to recover and potentially they could spin that off and turn that into a separate business that the Disney family would continue to run (although they'd need an agreement on IP use).To make it affordable there's also a lot of stuff that is basically ready to be broken up and sold.  You have Marvel Entertainment, LucasFilms, Pixar, Walt Disney Animation, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Studios... a lot of TV stations.  Disney+ is probably the only one that couldn't be broken from the rest because it runs at a loss.But.It's speculation.So I wouldn't go buying any stock on this because these kinds of rumors crop up every week.

POST_TEXT: b'In recent weeks, Apple Inc. has accelerated plans to shift some of its production outside China, long the dominant country in the supply chain that built the worlds most valuable company, say people involved in the discussions. It is telling suppliers to plan more actively for assembling Apple products elsewhere in Asia, particularly India and Vietnam, they say, and looking to reduce dependence on Taiwanese assemblers led by Foxconn Technology Group. Turmoil at a place called iPhone City helped propel Apples shift. At the giant city-within-a-city in China, as many as 300,000 workers work at a factory run by Foxconn to make iPhones and other Apple products. At one point, it alone made about 85% of the Pro lineup of iPhones, according to market-research firm Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe Zhengzhou factory was convulsed in late November by violent protests.

FoxCon factory is blowing up in their face, largest Apple production facility. That mixed with an American (largest customer base) with a recession on the horizon, World recession around the corner and European economic reshaping. I think the market for high priced electronics (non-essentials) isn‚Äôt great for the next 5-10 years. The mixture of moving manufacturing cost, higher production cost, limited market for primary gadgets, and limited innovations on the horizon. IMO it‚Äôs going to be a rough 10 years for Apple.

Just a way for apple not to put all their eggs in one basket but still have presence in china as they still sell there.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the digital wallet would be operated by Early Warning Services, a joint venture from several banks that also runs Zelle. The major banks involved include Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, according to the report.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 07:08:01'] This is silly. Apple/Samsung/Google Pay are all built into the devices natively from the factory and the entire user experience with these wallets is curated around that; I.e., device security designed with these wallets in mind, and things like paying from your lock screen or watch without needing to unlock or even pull out your device, and integration to your computer and other devices. None of these are probably going to be a thing with a third-party wallet app, but even if they are, what motivation would any user have to switch from the current ecosystem that already works?JPMorgan tried a pointless payment app before (Chase Pay) and failed because again, there is absolutely no reason to use anything other than <your device> Pay, I don't see this being any different.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 08:38:51'] Banks don't do much right, and everything is to extract more money from their customers. The fact that ATM fees exist, when they cut down on visits inside the bank, and the need for lots of tellers says it all. Sure, there is needed maintenance, but it's a fraction of costs it would take to pay for more human tellers.

US banks see this and say to themselves: why can‚Äôt we do the same?If this works, it‚Äôs going to be like Venmo & Paypal that can be connected directly to your bank account, so you don‚Äôt always need a credit card. When you scan a vendor‚Äôs QR code, the money moves directly from your bank account to his. This being America, the banks are leery about taking on Visa and Mastercard head on, so the payment system also works with credit cards. Not to mention a lot of people actually can‚Äôt afford stuff without credit cards.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:38:39'] For what it's worth, the eyes aren't visible.  It's got a screen on front that redisplays your eyes, (or likely, an AI-assisted model of your eyes), and fakes eye contact with eye tracking.  The screen changes to cloudy colors when the user "immerses" themselves in another world, (like watching a movie, or sitting on a mountaintop.

I imagine their 3500 headset is likely impressive AF compared to anything, and will be used at high level design particularly with corporate accounts, and people who can afford it. If you think apples first real launch in a decade is bad news then idk what to tell you. The only bad news would be bad reviews once released. But given their budget along with timeline of patience and perfection because they have that luxury, I don‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll be bad.

Well for one, there‚Äôs the constant buy-back dollars that Apple is putting to work.Ok, what else?  Any trader that wants a guaranteed return will play AAPL as it‚Äôs been played for decades. They almost always under-promise and over deliver on their fiscal results outside of black swan events despite annual FUD tales of supply chain woes or poor planning / estimates‚Äîdespite multiple pundits singing Apple‚Äôs unmatched skill at keeping their supply chain insanely healthy and diversified (outside of Covid‚Äîthough Apple did much better than others).So yeah‚Ä¶ nothing new to see here.  Headset is gonna ship. It‚Äôs going to sell however it sells.People will figure out what they want to do with it, and what it sucks at currently.Apple will iterate and if necessary make other choices if the AppleID‚Äôs say so.  Until then, focus on everything else was just released, as a gap in the Mac product lineup has been filled, and there‚Äôs a constant stream of tweaks and fixes that keep AppleID‚Äôs happy and using their devices.India is now unlocked and it‚Äôs the next major population target of growth and recurring Apple purchases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:02:46'] Wasn't sure the point of the announcement after seeing the price. Microsoft Hololens has been this price for 7+ years, and they aren't any close to a consumer product yet. Maybe that's one reason for the stock drop?

You don't need to buy the device to develop an app for it either. It's still 6months+ from being available to purchase too.

What's interesting is that they have yet to mass produce an AR-specific device, despite what they already have.  The Q Pro seems like it was meant to introduce the idea, while not throwing all their eggs in one basket.I think Meta is playing the long game on this one, and sees Apple as jumping the gun too early. Honestly I think Meta knows a lot more about this than Apple.

People use their phones on average 3-5 hours a day. Ditching an iPhone is like taking fentanyl away from a homeless man in San Francisco. It just isn't happening.

It sais Apple won‚Äôt produce more iPhone than decided before the lunch. It‚Äôs not the same thing at all.Also, Apple had to rearrange production lines to produce more iPhone 14 pro and less iPhone 14, because the demand is higher for the most expensive one. Which is rather good.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 06:25:58'] >The Cupertino, California-based electronics maker has told suppliers to pull back from efforts to increase assembly of the iPhone 14 product family by as many as 6 million units in the second half of this year, said the people, asking not to be named as the plans are not public. Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple‚Äôs original forecast this summer, the people said.  Demand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people. In at least one case, an Apple supplier is shifting production capacity from lower-priced iPhones to premium models, they added.&#x200B;The Bloomberg article calls out that the premium model of the phone is still experiencing high demand, and so the new strategy may be to focus on premium phones + headsets. We'll have to wait and see what the quarterly numbers look like.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 07:49:12'] Now that 2/3 Carriers are locking customers in 36 month financing plans, we have an additional hurdle to upgrading. The carriers love it because it lets them stretch promotions out, locking customers and ducking credits to customers who have to upgrade in 2 year periods. That's a factor here, for sure. Apples model, for years, relied on 2 year upgrade cycles.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 07:54:12'] This means practically no revenue growth nor earnings growth for AAPL next year. You are paying 25x earnings for a stock with a very high chance of no earnings growth in the next year.

With the $40 a month that's gonna save me on my bill I went ahead and ordered a new Series 7 watch since they had a $150 off promo. My monthly bill is still $25 cheaper than before, and my phone works perfectly. Otterbox's and screen protectors are worth every fuckin penny. IMO having longer lasting more reliable tech should bring value to the company/stock. They shouldn't need to sell record numbers of the new phones every time they come out. I also think maybe they slow tf down with how often they're releasing them... but idk shit about fuck lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:20:22'] According to CNBC, this matches analyst consensus. But according to AH, the market definitely expected a beat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:11:38'] I must admit I am somewhat surprised that Tesla has had to cut prices so much and get reduced margins already.  I thought they had a couple more years of being able to run wild before really having to adjust so much to face stiffer competition.  If that's the case already, then you have to wonder how things will look when more of the big boys really start to ramp up production.Anyway I likely never will own any Tesla equity directly (only through index funds) because their share price is never rational.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:15:27'] I think it's important to put this in the context of other car companies.Ford, for instance, is selling every EV they make for a loss.

Say it‚Äôs crap and the customers are dumb. Meanwhile they dominate the ev market after they made the ev market. There is no competition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:13:16'] It‚Äôs a premium auto manufacturer. They sell cars marketed towards the crowds of high income, loves to be on the cusp of lifestyle tech. The gigantic layoffs from big tech the past 6 months of course were going to hit in their biggest demographic.Tesla is a car conpany. Electric propulsion, Ai powered cruise controls are cool features they have a narrow lead on, not any exclusivity. Legacy auto will be more than ready to keep its market share when the electric car buying really ramps up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:29:22'] Overreact and sell if you want to. I'll be buying at the lower prices. In a few years time Telsa will be still be increasing production, cutting costs, and announcing new factories. The competition will be fighting to sell a significant number at profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:35:24'] unit growth and topline is still good considering amount of price cuts seen. but huge drop in GM/OM. Big question is CT launch. Its April and they are just saying later this year. Dont think CT will have any impact on top line this year. Plus with no M2 for another 2 years(if we have to wait for Mexico GF to go online) at minimum, I think growth will stall unless they decrease price even more which is hard to see with the margins seen.

POST_TEXT: b'\nApple Inc. is still planning to unveil its first mixed-reality headset this year, but an even more important follow-up product  lightweight augmented-reality glasses  has been postponed due to technical challenges. \n\nThe company had originally hoped to release the AR glasses after the debut of its mixed-reality headset, which combines both AR and virtual reality, but that part of the plan is now on hold. Instead, Apple will follow up with a lower-cost version of the mixed-reality headset as soon as 2024 or early 2025, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nThe shifting plans underscore the challenges Apple faces in pushing into a new industry. The company is betting that AR and VR devices could be a major moneymaker, but the technical challenges of producing a consumer-friendly product has bedeviled much of the tech world.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 13:31:17'] man, maybe I'm just old (40), but i think I'm stepping off the treadmill. I'm completely fine owning a smart phone, but I'm totally not interested in AR glasses. the amount of sales potential in this space seems extremely limited. maybe a few niche enthusiasts will go for it, but my sense is most people won't want these products. we are getting to the point of diminishing returns on personal mobile devices. higher and higher prices, for not much additional benefit. smart phones totally revolutionized daily life for most people. AR glasses don't add much to that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 10:43:34'] AAPL is waaay to late in the VR/AR space game. Its competitors have had 10 year lead.The only way I see Apple breaking into the Vr space if their new headset is revolutionary i'm talking the original iphone revolution caliber here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 20:40:52'] Makes sense.  It will take at least a decade before the technology can be miniaturized to that form factor.  I do wish that they'd at least try to make their own echo frames and market it as an accessory for the apple watch so that people can get into the idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 08:43:33'] It seems like AR and VR are not set for mass adoption until a breakthrough in technology happens. Fresnel lenses look like shit, batteries and displays are too heavy, and processors are too slow. I say this as a new VR enthusiast playing racing simulators exclusively. How can I bet against this?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 03:31:53'] Kudos to Apple.  A lot of companies would probably go ahead.  I still think the ideal AR product would be Google software and Apple hardware.AR is a lot about AI and Apple is terrible at anything involving AI.  Where Google is the AI leader.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 12:38:20'] This is a single model that is probably way too large for most people's main use case. IMHO the regular 12/13/14 size is the sweet spot for most consumers. I wouldn't read into this too much or use it to make options strategy. Also keep in mind Apple's services sector is showing a strong growth trajectory and the COGS there is a \*ton\* lower.

It‚Äôs rather stupid to base a business on people throwing out brand new expensive products for slightly newer ones with minimal upgrades, every year. Like, the ‚Äúyou deserve to go out of business‚Äù kind of stupid. Unfortunately, most people are pretty stupid too and happy to be incredibly wasteful, as long as it‚Äôs fashionable. But the business model relies on these people having the resources to be stupid with. Even as you give them less and less to survive off of. Apple‚Äôs greed, assumed superiority, and reliance on stupidity as a business model is close to defeating itself through the greed, assumed superiority, and reliance on stupidity that sees them pay executives thousands of times as much as retail employees. Your retail employees are your customers. Fucking idiots. And you‚Äôve pushed their standard of living below the line where they can afford to be stupid and buy your products at the rate you need to survive. Stupidity. At its finest.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 03:16:21'] Record high inflation and incoming recession. No one wants to waste money to upgrade a phone that is literally the same as last years model.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 04:24:19'] iPhone 14 plus was a bad proposition anyways. Someone who can shell enough money for a ‚Äúplus‚Äù can definitely go to a ‚Äúpro‚Äù to get those few extra features.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 09:39:19'] I said this would probably happen in the summer when it was trading near its ATHs. What surprised me at the time I sold was how many people disagreed with me given how obvious it seemed to me. And even now it seems a lot of people are still seeing this as a buying opportunity given it's still trading decently above its lows. I think this stock is easily heading to low $120s. I don't see how they won't dramatically disappoint given the macro.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 11:48:02'] Each iteration of the Iphone has less dramatic improvements.  I mean most people just don't need to replace a phone ever 6 months.My wife has the pixel 5 and for all intents and purposes it takes really fantastic photos and works fine.  I just got an email from Verizon I can trade it in for the new pixel 7 and pay like 7 or 9$ a month, since its over 2 years old nothing to pay off...  It seems things are getting desperate out here.  Either way I really think the rising costs of everything are going to put a damper on people deciding to upgrade a perfectly good device just because.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 13:03:48'] no one wants an oversized expensive second tier iphone. wow! a few companies might pay out a bit less in dividends for a while. is that supposed to be earth shattering? better sell all your apple stock today right? lol.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 12:52:25'] SCHD is unfortunately a bit expensive at the moment, its about 20% from its bottom and it has a tight range to begin with since its a defensive-based stock etf. AAPL has room to grow for sure. Their recent news is worrisome but the stock price itself was getting pretty low last week, so much that I put in a limit order at $125. Still, I would have enough faith in AAPL's history to believe it will persevere to make the decision to keep it instead of moving right now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 18:19:13'] This is a classic case when people tend to move to dividend stocks from growth, its almost the bottom is nearby if not already made. I would just hold at this point

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 17:43:43'] ask yourself what your goal is: income generation (that you can reinvest in a slow, steady, compounding way) or multiply your money or preserve wealth. idk if apple does any of the three well at this stage (when things can‚Äôt get any better, they tend to get worse), but I know having a poor outlook on tech is unpopular. Personally, in your situation I would switch and use the income from dividends to reinvest and broaden my portfolio into growth and risk but my main goal is to multiply my money and then one day switch to dividends for income. therefore, I don‚Äôt hold apple.edit: apple stock may appreciate from here if you want to hold portion of it to limit volatility of your portfolio. if that is all of your money in that one stock, that‚Äôs not good
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 18:46:59'] I'd hold on to the AAPL and set it to reinvest dividends.  New money can go in a different direction.  I suggest a low cost Index ETF or Mutual Fund or Indexed Target Date Fund.  Stay away from actively managed funds or high fee funds.  My 2c.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:17:31'] Long private prisons.  Short Apple. Lol. Ok got it. God Bless America.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:16:08'] Love how he sold everyting except for "GEO Group Inc." - big friendly private prison system franchise ;)  He's such an optimist!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:27:12'] Wonder how those apple puts are going for him ...
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:38:46'] I share his sentiment that we're likely gonna go much lower, but I'd love to see someone research into his yearly returns and compare them to S&P 500 as well as perhaps research his predictions after 2008 just to see how right he was in the past 15ish years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:57:42'] Betting on prisons going to the moon, I'm fucking in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:43:11'] Reddit is way too optimistic this month, that tells me a lot of people will get humbled soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:05:29'] Does anyone listen to this guy? He acts like a child on social media, makes these crazy moonshot bets, and I can't remember when he was last right...was it 2008?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:37:22'] Ahh yes, the perma bear doing perma bear stuff
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 12:28:01'] He has f you money so his decisions aren‚Äôt really relatable to the general public. For most of us trying to time the market is a fools errand. Better to just be invested and be in it for the long term. I‚Äôve been investing for over ten years and every time I sell in panic I regret it. I‚Äôve missed the rally every time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 17:25:57'] Wow - very one sided take on this. I originally thought he‚Äôs just a doomsdayer. But every single person commenting is writing him off. I‚Äôm starting to think he‚Äôs onto something!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:43:15'] A lot of people in this thread who are way smarter than Michael Burry but somehow way poorer and don‚Äôt hold medical doctorates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:04:03'] His reasoning? Can't shake a certain silly precrash feeling...Last I heard, if you want to make money in the market you go based on FEELINGS /s
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:41:11'] I have a feeling most of the commenters are going to feel very silly in a a year or so.  You guys are writing Burry off as if he isn't an insanely smart investor.  He might be early, but I wouldn't bet against the guy long term.  We'd all get smoked.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:11:28'] Besides 2008, was he ever right again? Or is he just making all kinds of predictions and some work out?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 20:04:57'] Geo Group.I just lost an immense amount of respect for Burry. If it were not for the 13th Amendment and legal slavery, Geo Group would not exist. There are plenty of places to make money, feeding that beast is inexcusable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 20:28:07'] Yay for privatized prisons traded in the market... Ya that's not a incitive to keep locking people up at all üôÑ
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 01:28:11'] Burry is like a broken clock, he's been saying for the past 10 years there's going to be a bear market. Everyone knows there will be another bear market but if he can't time it down to the year he's useless. He got lucky last time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 03:11:26'] Trying to profit off of mental health issues and incarceration is wrong and disgusting.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:46:57'] A lot of folks don‚Äôt realize he started shorting the housing market in ‚Äò03. That‚Äôs a full 5 years before the market crashed. Very few people have the capital to be bleeding money on short positions for 5 years

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:03:01'] If trump goes to the prison maybe he will change them to casinos that means burry is investing in casinos
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 19:49:21'] We should get this administration to completely reform prisons to fuck him over.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 22:45:53'] His AAPL puts would have been risk management. It was a good play. If stocks go up he loses but if they went down then AAPL is on a huge correction as it is heavily over s&p500 performance from all the boggleheads and bulls calling the bottom and a fed pivot. He only needed a small put to equally weight his portfolio between potential upside and downside. He must be thinking that Q3 will be where the PE ratios adjust to new market conditions and he will probably be playing heavy bear. He is a contrarian investor to Buffets value investment. With so many idiots thinking it‚Äôs the next bull run there is more reason to be a contrarian and see a potential drop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 06:51:27'] He is using his mouthpiece to benefit his investment...
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:59:05'] This person is basically insane if you read his general thoughts so proceed with caution when considering his opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:24:11'] Isn't he a conspiracy theorist that claimed that Trump won in 2020 ? Why should even consider his opinion?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:47:54'] This guys is just a huge buzz kill. Constant doom and gloom
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:57:52'] Looked up his Twitter last week. Now I want a sequel of the movie and how he became an obsessed trumpist weirdo. He fell so deep into the rabbit hole, you can even play a game like: "who said it? Marjorie Taylor Greene or Burry?" He is so obsessed that he posted more about Trump than about stocks. Related to stocks this guy is gone for me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:19:19'] He is right. We are in a bear market rally in a bear market. The stock market correction ('crash') will manifest itself in the next few weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:22:48'] This guy has predicted about 50 out of the last 3 recessions we‚Äôve had since 2000. If you‚Äôre always predicting the same thing, then you‚Äôre bound to hit on a few‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:41:45'] Puts on SPX have hit the same level as 2020. Buckle up. It‚Äôs going to get rough. We‚Äôre about at peak euphoria.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:42:19'] People have been abusing Michael Burry's name. Ok he was right on point in 2008, but since then he predicted a life ending event twice a year, every year.   People need to chill a little a bit. So far he misses more than he hits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:09:56'] I'll keep saying it every Michael Burry post I see on here - the dude is just a regular dick. He's not a wizard, not a saint, not a prophet. He's on par with the Kardashians for most unnecessary fame.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:24:16'] Meh. If you keep calling for a crash you'll be right...eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:10:14'] He is the definition of a perma bear. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who would‚Äôve said that we had another 50% to fall at the bottom of the Great Depression. Also the kind of guy that would‚Äôve said the internet was a passing fad in the ‚Äò90s
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:14:15'] If I wasn‚Äôt so lazy I‚Äôd make a chart of timelines of him saying there‚Äôs going to be crash and the reality of it for several months and years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 13:09:28'] All of these "Einsteins" share one thing in common. They've been extremely "right" ONCE (via luck mostly), but never right repeatedly.  He just joins a very long list of the current "stock picking whiz" who never can seem to duplicate with any sort of repeatability their initial luck run.The list includes people like Eddie Lampert, Cathie Wood, David Einhorn, Bill Ackman, Gabe Plotkin, and even Masa himself! They are still considered brilliant despite their dubious records after their respective "big deals".
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:15:21'] Only long is private prison. This guy seriously sucks
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 18:18:15'] The man got one thing right and has a lifetime free pass on shitty predictions now. Insufferable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:37:06'] Excepting this recent Bear Market Rally that may turn out to be a prescient move.  Do remember that he tends to be a few months to a year early on his moves.   I have a similar mindset.  We shall see.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:23:36'] This guys hands are papier-m√¢ch√©
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 15:11:58'] He sold in Q2?  At the bottom?  Even it goes lower from here, smart money sold in Q4/Early Q1.  I am dumb money and I sold a good portion of my holdings just in case at that time and bought some puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 15:46:06'] His 15 mins of fame has run out a long time ago.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:06:41'] so he missed out 15% boom in last 3 weeks? lolHow many times this expert predicts bear market and goes bankrupt?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 17:59:53'] Scion 10 year performance:[https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry/performance](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/michael-burry/performance)Assuming the above chart is true, he has essentially under performed the S&P since 2016 if you account for dividends. And to make matters worse, I assume much of those gains were due to GME. In other words, he is pretty lousy at trading and he is certainly not an "investor".
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 18:05:43'] Puts on apple.  Mf'r has a death wish.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 12:25:05'] Lol.  He sold before the rally, and is now telling people not to get too excited about the rally he missed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:09:19'] Buy high sell low!

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:47:37'] So out of all the companies he could have been bearish about he decided to have puts in apple? Literally tons of companies are trading at crazy valuations with no positive cash flow and he decided to buy puts on apple. Mind boggling

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/apple-tightens-its-rules-on-crypto-and-nfts-in-its-app-store.html\n\nApple clarified its rules on cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) laying out what apps are allowed to do with these technologies. On crypto exchanges, Apple said in updated App Store rules on Monday, that apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange. But the app can only be offered in countries or regions where it has licensing and permission to operate a crypto exchange. Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency wallets. Apple has clarified the rules on NFTs, which can be a digital representation of a real-life asset such as artwork and are usually purchased using cryptocurrency.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 06:56:38'] I kind of hope this helps the app store cut system collapse (even though AAPL would absolutely dive overnight, and I have big exposure through ETFs). I'm not at all into NFTs or crypto, but I think we can all agree that they're basically high-risk securities. Of course they're far from "secure", but then so are Chinese and Russian stocks, so...In what world does it make sense that Apple is allowed to take a 30 % cut of stock transactions performed in an app? If you pay a bill using your bank's app, should they get 30 % of that as well?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 07:46:08'] I assume this is more to protect their existing business with in game micro transactions. Developers could move those to NFTs to get around the 30% cut for Apple. My assumption is they want to outlaw that before developers start using that mechanism.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 12:53:45'] This "clarification" was a given to happen. Many apps have tried to circumvent access to app content by offering an NFT to access the content. This is one of the use-cases of an NFT. Apple clearly wants to avoid this and thus said, nope.. you can't do that! From the stock level, this means Apple wants to make more revenue :) Simple as that... Since buying an NFT using the crypto wallet, will not benefit Apple at all. So think about it, why would Apple even want to allow that in the first place? Apple stock will just continue to go up and up because they are always limiting everyone to use the IAPs to make revenue. Simple as that!

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/apple-movie-plan-boosts-theater-stocks-amc.html\n\nCinema stocks jumped Thursday after a report said Apple plans to spend $1 billion a year on theatrical film releases.\n\nThe investment is part of the tech companys efforts to raise its profile in Hollywood and lure subscribers to its streaming service, Apple TV+, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nTypically, Apple has released films directly to its streaming platform or allowed limited runs in a small number of theaters for Academy Award eligibility. Apple recently won best picture for its film CODA.\n\nThe commitment to longer theatrical releases is a way for the company to appease talent, who want their projects on the big screen, and drum up awareness for its streaming platform, which is estimated to have between 20 million and 40 million users, much smaller than rivals Netflix and Disney+.\n\nCinemark jumped as much as 10% on the news, while IMAX and AMC rose about 4% and 5%, re'

The only hope would be for the public to demand its elected  officials implement a law that no households who have any members who work for the US government are allowed to own anything but personal assets (house, cars, etc.) and US treasuries for life. I can‚Äôt imagine what kind of unintended consequences would result from a blanket ban for life or even just while the individual is working for the government. The problem is there‚Äôs no good solution. We clearly can‚Äôt rely on the integrity of these officials to do the right thing and the only solutions will be too extreme (not to mention highly unlikely to ever get implemented).

Even on the high end that averages 10k measly dollars, lower end 2k, per employeeThey fluffed it up by giving total dollars which sounds bad but I want to see a breakdown of averages. This isn't Pelosi level insider trading. While it should be stopped I'm not sure it needs to be punished as it's such large scale and seemingly average people just trying to get a leg up in life.I'm willing to bet more than half of us would try this knowing it's unlikely to get caught if it's not a huge amount.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:07:42'] The real answer is we don‚Äôt know.Generally most of the time it‚Äôs best to throw it all in as soon as possible in 1 go. Although it does give people peace of mind if they DCA the money into the stock instead. Just make sure to have a clear DCA Plan and follow it consistently no matter whatConsider an ETF though.

My thought was that APPL would get to $1000 in a couple of years and I would have a nice $20k+ profit. Well 2 stock splits and several ATHs later and that $50k investment was worth over $500k. APPL is a stock that you can truly say that the best time to buy was 20 years ago; the second best time to buy is today.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:25:51'] I mean over the long term (10-30) you‚Äôre going to get a decent return as long as they continue to make their business better. But at 28 PE that‚Äôs less than a 4% earnings yield. If you‚Äôre expecting 20-30% average return over 5 or so years you‚Äôre most likely going to be disappointed. If you‚Äôre okay with a 4% return they will do that pretty damn easily.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 14:20:36'] Do you have 40k specifically for Apple or 40k to invest in general. Much safer to buy SPY instead. Whatever you decide to buy, the environment is very unpredictable now, so I wouldn‚Äôt throw all 40k in at once. Set a date by which you want all 40k to be in the market and spread the investment weekly until then. E.g. if you want to put it all by end of the year, put like 2-2.5k per week in. I don‚Äôt think the strategy to put everything before the Apple event and cash out after thinking it will go up to 220 is safe at all. There are not big news or big surprises coming in that should have any big movement due to the event unless Apple was planning a brand new product (e.g. apple glasses). The only thing important from the event is whether Apple is going to raise prices in lieu with inflation. Apple is one of those firms that are capable of increasing their prices without losing market share, which is the kind of firm you like to invest during periods of high inflation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 14:34:21'] There is one thing that will make an average investor rich eventually: compounding! You can compound at 15% per year for 20 years or you can compound at 5%. It makes a huge difference. If you think the most valuable company of the world can return 10% or more for years  go for it, odds are pretty small though. Apple is seen as a safe almost defensive stock now, they just buy back stock and have no risk of getting into any type of financial hardship in the foreseeable future, so investors park money there.  When risk-on investing comes back you will see mediocre returns from Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 17:26:24'] Stocks typically take off in Q4 following midterm elections. Apple discussed $6-8 B in sales being impacted due to supply chain issues in Q1, 2 that may be realizing soon. iPhone release this year is early so that revenue will be captured in Q3. Also, Q4 has an addition week this year so their numbers will be padded. I‚Äôm assuming that they will want to buyback most of the $90 B they announced before 2023 taxes kick in. There‚Äôs also a small chance that they release MR glasses in the next 6 months. Finally, their India plant will be ramping up to produce iPhone, watch, and Mac. I‚Äôd say short term looks really bright and if you have a 10 yr horizon, you will look back and be thankful that you bought in.

Unless you're expecting a market crash like I do, a $150-$160 entry would seem reasonable in the near future.  At the moment I'm not planning to buy or sell, just wait this one out.

The federal government is raising the interest rates which is going to restrict a lot of peoples money making them want to spend less as borrowing money is going to cost more.Now it‚Äôs entirely up to you, but if you truly want to invest the money look into ETFs that contain apple.

It's been a WILD ride ever since then.Got to have the guts to do it for the long term, which means buying and holding for 20 years.  And it sucked when shit went down in March 2020 to the lowest lows seen in a long time.  I didn't know I was doing it then, but me trying to buy more of the stocks (mid and late 2020) I bought just to bring the averages down to make me feel better worked out in the longer-run where I sold a few at their highs, and bought other stocks with the profits when they were at their lower points in 2022.

Best time to fomo into APPL.JK, AAPL is still the best individual tech stock if you want tech exposure.

Big money can sell their shares at any moment causing huge price swings and can leave investors holding the bag the next day when market opens.

POST_TEXT: b'My stock portfolio is about 50% VOO/25% VGT and a bunch of individual stocks from different sectors. VOO and especially VGT are super heavy on AAPL & MSFT as it is. The indiviaul Apple and Microsoft stocks I own make up about 15% of that remaining 25% of my portfolio. I bought them when they were really cheap in October 2022 and have held them since for some great returns. Now I am wondering if I should sell them and allocate into that \\~15% into VIG or SCHD or other individual companies for more diversity. \n\nAdvice appreciated - ty!'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:08:13'] I‚Äôd hold them and steadily add more shares of vig/voo/schd/etc until your portfolio is more balanced to your liking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:05:01'] Never sell. Just grow your other positions if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with the percentage
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:04:11'] One of the biggest mistakes you can make is selling your winners (AAPL/MSFT) to buy more of your losers (SCHD).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:26:28'] Don‚Äôt do it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:34:35'] My portfolio is also very top heavy with Apple, result of buying shares in 2013 and 2014 that are up like 450%. I‚Äôm not selling, fundamentals look good, ROIC is great, and I believe they‚Äôll continue to grow. I won‚Äôt sell until those things change, no matter how many times Personal Capital warns me I have ‚Äòsignificant single stock concentration risk‚ÄôI accept the risk. You just have to decide if you do too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:18:05'] Or sell covered calls on them. Collect the premium and if you get assigned, then oh well, you were going to sell anyways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:14:20'] Don‚Äôt do it. The gains you will likely see from those two stocks in 10, 15, 20 or more years will probably be much greater than any given fund could ever produce. Neither Apple or Microsoft are going out of business any time soon. I think I read some article that said that every $1000 invested in Apple just 20 years ago would be worth over $600k now. While I don‚Äôt know if these same gains will be true for the future, I suspect both Apple and Microsoft will continue to outperform most funds. I could be wrong, but I wouldn‚Äôt sell. I‚Äôm actually trying to fix some past mistakes- my late father gave me a small portfolio many years ago, heavily invested in funds. If he had put the same money into Apple and Microsoft, I would have no financial worries today. The funds actually hold quite a bit of those two stocks, but the growth has paled in comparison. I only buy stocks now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 21:35:30'] Hold forever
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:46:00'] People only say to no sell because they keep going up and they say to sell when other stuff is going down, if theyre so knowledgable why they didnt say what a bargains META, Nvidia or Tesla are? because they were scared shitless of it going lower but theyre cocky when somethings keep pumping - it must be guaranteed it will be even higher in the future!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:58:10'] Why not sell APPL and buy BRKB instead. This way you still make a good chunk of profit when APPL is up, and at the same time diversify more
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:26:04'] Take the gains on your Microsoft and Apple and buy ETFs. When something hits the market again buy the dip again.  In the meantime keep buying VOO\VTI SCHD etc.  but at the same time Microsoft and Apple aren‚Äôt really ever a problem so holding is fine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 17:57:09'] In the same place myself, so, godspeed with whatever you decide
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:27:00'] Im not a big fan of SP500, just buy the top 3 of all the sectors, top 10 if u want more diversification and enjoy a bigger return, and u dont hold useless stocks that even if they move 100% up will not move the index 1% up because appl is down 0.5%...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:39:40'] They can only grow so much more. AAPLs market cap is nearly $400 per person in the world.I would sell half of each position minimum
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 21:43:22'] I‚Äôd sell Microsoft. The stock has priced in quite a few things, such as the AI boom brought by Bard and cloud momentum. But I understand it may be against popular opinion.Apple has more upside in my mind. Stock hasn‚Äôt priced in anything related to AI, which is good. I can‚Äôt get over how massive the iPhone is. Quite possibly the most important tech in the history of human race. There‚Äôs so much value to be unlocked through iPhones and their absurd amounts of data.Those are my thoughts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:48:53'] I personally would not sell AAPL or MSFT.   The only stock like better is GOOG.    My view it is GOOG > AAPL > MSFT > AMZNAMZN will also be rewarded from the LLM.  It takes a lot of resources to run the models.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 16:50:02'] Essentially ~1/3 of your portfolio is AAPL and MSFT!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:28:48'] Sell! Then buy back in when apple $200+ and MSFT $40+
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 18:03:12'] October 22 is not that long ago. Generally I say let your winners run. I am also a strict asset allocation zealot my sweet stop being 4%. I don‚Äôt put more than 4% into any one investment.I would be more thrilled if I liked where you would put the funds. Can you pick stocks? It‚Äôs a rhetorical question. The statistics say you can‚Äôt without underperforming.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:17:46'] If you want to ‚Äúcash in‚Äù, you can essentially trim your position in the two by selling all msft/aapl and using all proceeds to invest in VOO, which is 7.22% AAPL and 6.55% MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:23:37'] Just keep em.  They're both going to continue to be massively held stocks by institutions.  SCHD is just moving sideways (I know this because it's a substantial piece of my pie).

Hit $3 trillion at their peak. That is a growth company. AMD has grown from $100 billion to $160 billion. If I expect them to be $300+ billion market cap in a few years, they are a huge growth name. How can you mention Intel and shit on AMD in the same post? Lol. It is also a beginner‚Äôs mistake to think that you have to find the $1 billion dollar market cap company that will get to $20 billion. More of these will cut in half than those that 20x their market cap. **Higher risk does not guarantee higher reward.**

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 14:55:39'] Smart investors stay away from the stocks ‚Äúthat everyone talks about‚Äù. The famous stocks have a high risk of being overvalued, because fanboys buy them without proper evaluation. This drives the price higher than it should be. The price could still go up if more people become fanboys, but at that point it‚Äôs like a painting. The price only depends on what people want to pay so it‚Äôs basically random. A safer way would be to find undervalued companies, which are easier to find among the small unknown companies

We got mega cap tech companies like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc even though are already established make a ton of money that is returned to shareholder value in the form of massive buybacks and dividends. So of course they are going to be discussed.2. We got speculative plays that blew up and are growing market share like AMD, TSLA, and NVDA. I would personally argue that the valuations make me not want to touch them. However I can see why these stocks would appeal to people as they are growing earnings like crazy and have the potential of being big blue chip companies.3. You got risky plays like META, and INTC. Me personally I am not touching them. However once again I can see why they would appeal to some people and be discussed as they are already established companies that make money but are trading at a low valuation due to big earnings loss and short term risk.4. We got just your standard blue chip dividend companies like JNJ, TGT, KO, PG, PEP, WM, etc. there is nothing really to discuss about these cause they are kind of universal buy and hold companies. They have been around for decades and have been growing stock price and dividends. So I don‚Äôt know what is there to discuss except buy and hold. 5. We got penny stocks and I feel like nobody discusses those cause of how much risk is involved in them. Most people on here lets be real have no idea what they are doing. So discussing penny stocks is not really a process and is just mindless speculation.So my question to you is which stocks should be discussed? M**e stocks were basically banned from being discussed a long time ago.

The are debt-free, freshly transformed, have a new, dedicated team in upper management that is manically focused on the long term, currently significantly outperform the SPY (even in the recent overall small bull hill) and they have an incredibly dedicated, albeit a bit weird, shareholderbase that hold, continuously buy more and register the shares in their own name (establishing a direct connection to the company and render their shares un-lendable) no matter what the current overall sentiment outside of their bubble is.People can shit on them all they want (and they even do, if you look at the overall negative sentiment and the sheer volume of negative artikels and 'analysis' on their stock) and their strategies are very much debatable, but you can not neglegt these facts. Also what's more bullish than a slowly growing community of crazily stubborn maniac amateurs who try to learn stuff and have a crush on a certain chairman?There, I've said it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 10:29:02'] A point is that historically from 1926 is that only 4% of companies stand for all marketprofits (excess profits over bonds). So If a megacompany emerges it will likely continue to be mega.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 13:52:40'] This sub downvoted comments regarding GME and many are proud to short it roughly a month and a half ago, considering YTD GME is green, as well as AMC, and sure as AAPL since 5-26, this sub is not for forward thinking investors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:52:04'] I find other companies far more interesting. Most of big tech is going to start coming up against anti trust legislation soon, imo. It's hard to argue against these names though. They are juggernauts. That said, the top performers of one decade are seldom the top performers of the next. I too wish there was more discussion of other names as well. There are so many more interesting names on the small/mid cap side of things. There are lots of sectors outside of tech. There are lots of potential market outperform stocks, and not all of them have to be disruptive moon shots.After all that, I do my best to put some of the names I find interesting into the discussion here. It's my way of trying to diversify the discussion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:56:15'] Looking at how everything played out during the last hmmm 5 years(?) it‚Äôs almost as no matter what stocks you choose, regardless of fundamentals or anything or all went up or down about the same.  The speculation wsb stocks went crazy high but so did good companies ‚Ä¶. And the oposite was true. Everything came down regardless of anything besides feelings. As more of normies enter these trading platforms the crazier it gets. And if everyone piles up into faang then it affects everything else seems like it. As those are part of almost every etf/funds and if those mega corps come down so does those funds which affect the feelings about everything else. To me the future is in robotics. It‚Äôs a little premature now of course but that‚Äôs where the huge growth will be imo. And mid level companies in China. There will a lot more Tencent and baba coming around but it‚Äôs really hard to research them.And the issue with robotics is that the big tech companies are all over this field. So it‚Äôs hard to ‚Äúbet‚Äù in nvidia in the robotic side if they keep appealing the crypto kids.And the etf/funds just pile up the same big players that do other stuff that rely on subscription growth or ad revenue. So I‚Äôm still trying to look for good stocks in robotics and mid level Chinese companies. But seeing these huge ups and downs makes me just hold on for a bit.

It‚Äôs good to throw the fishing line in for 5-10% of your portfolio but it‚Äôs extremely important to also invest in the giants that are safe and still provide steady growth like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, etc. sure these likely won‚Äôt see 150% growth in a year but they also won‚Äôt crash 200% in a year and go bankrupt like those powerball pick penny stocks. I will say I definitely would prefer people post some of their more less heard of picks bc everybody knows which companies are safe and which aren‚Äôt. At the same time it‚Äôs just as important to throw in 5-10% of gamble picks in your portfolio bc diversification is 99% of the game.

Two contributions from me:SeaSpine and Ford. SeaSpine seem steady, while Ford seems like one of those ‚Äúturnaround‚Äù cases. Positive balance sheets, decent upside.

POST_TEXT: b'Bloomberg:\n\n"Paramount Global, looking to reduce costs as it copes with a loss of traditional TV viewers, is letting go of about 25% of the staff in its domestic cable networks and shutting down MTV News after four decades on the air.\n\nEmployees are being notified Tuesday, the company said in a statement. Paramount is combining nine separate teams into one. It had already announced plans to merge its Showtime and MTV studios\n\nDespite subscriber growth and new hit shows, We continue to feel pressure from broader economic headwinds like many of our peers, said Chris McCarthy, head of the companys media networks.\n\nParamount shares collapsed 30% last week after the company reported an 11 per cent decline in ad sales at its traditional TV networks and a US$511 million loss in streaming. The results underscore the challenges big media companies face in making the transition to online viewing."\n\n[Full article from Bloomberg here](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/paramount'

Also I'm wondering if the poor consumer spending is going to hurt Amazon's retail side although potentially it could boost it as it can be cheaper to shop online.Apple is the one I'm really watching though, I think they just mainly gained from a covid boost on their products which is slipping away and that's going to also affect the margins boost they have been enjoying.  Services is looking good but I just don't think it's going to be enough to fill that gap and growth might slow in macro headwinds come up.

Additionally, many advertisers moved over from Meta to Google due to the apple ios changes, so I'd say Google is the one indirectly poaching the small businesses from Meta right now. It also isn't entirely clear on HOW apple is planning on entering the advertising business. I know they already have the app store, but not entirely sure what other options they have. Also, this story is overblowing it a little because Apple literally is just opening a couple of positions.

Apple is reportedly going to be sued later this year by the DOJ for how they have  managed their App Store and their anti-competitive behavior. Now they hurt Meta bad by their privacy changes and then they target their advertisers?  Can‚Äôt stand Meta but It just looks like more anti-competitive behavior. Love Apple but if you want to know how a company can go from a P/E in the high 20‚Äôs to one in the high teens, multiple DOJ lawsuits hanging over your head for years is a good way to start. Really don‚Äôt think this was smart at all.

Because of the status that comes along with it? Because they like non compatibility with windows and co? Overpriced products? Funding a weird design philosophy? It can't be the value at least. I could only understand it if you got so much money you don't care about prices anymore...I honestly don't get it! Would love to know your honest reason for buying apple products!

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 12:54:53'] Apple will lose market share soon. Their vision is terrible.  They have a solid product that hasn‚Äôt changed in years. But that‚Äôs the problem. No real innovation is happening at apple. They are a company that is awesome now. In 5 years, I think they will be lagging behind competitors.  Meta is a speculative investment now. They aren‚Äôt valued low enough just yet, imo, to invest in what could be an amazing pivot or a freaking terrible one.

POST_TEXT: b'APPLE seems to be riding pretty high these days. yesterday I happened to watch the $ BRK.B  Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders meeting. \n\nWarren Buffett even made the comment that Apple stock performance was better than any company that  Berkshire owned. \n\nThat is why he is so high on Apple.  With apples buy back and the increase in dividends, I see APPLE hitting probably $200 before the end of 2023. Does anybody agree?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:47:29'] AAPL will definitely go up this quarter, unless it goes down, in which case it will go down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:17:36'] There aren‚Äôt a whole lot of companies trading at all time highs right now. Judging on the comments here you can look at it two ways. One is you own the best company in the entire stock market. The other is that if you buy today there‚Äôs not much room for growth. I tend to think that buying good companies is rarely something you regret, and it isn‚Äôt priced stratospherically high either. As far as addressing that Buffett bought at share prices less than 140 dollars amd isn‚Äôt buying at todays prices, it‚Äôs because apple is nearly half of Berkshires portfolio. How much more could he buy without being dangerously lopsided as far as diversification?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:10:05'] When you say BRK.B loves AAPL... They only have 1 buy above 160.  Only 3 above 140.  The other 97% of AAPL was bought far far below.  So when you say they love it, you mean they love to hold it.  They aren't buying here lol.  They are counting on people like you to buy here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:58:11'] I expect the elite blue chips like AAPL to trade flat until the storm clouds clear, then start making new ATHs. I think they will look great compared to the cyclicals/energy/banks that get trashed from the higher rates. Defensive + good balance sheet = conservation of capital.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:44:59'] Not to be downer but there are a ton of reasons to believe Apple is going to underperform over the next few years. A stock follows its company's earnings over the long term, or rather a constant state of expected earnings growth, of which Apple is truly lackluster. Top and bottom line growth projection are awful (single digit) when compared with the other megacap names like GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA yet AAPL is still substantially more expensive than its historical average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 07:04:01'] Everyone is focusing on the financial or market results of Apple but no one is looking at the Apple products, which I think are becoming crappier, much like after the first time Steve Jobs left Apple. The product lines are not clear and no one is saying no there. Apple can coast for a long time but I‚Äôd be concerned as a long term holder.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 20:10:46'] If you could only buy one of these three AAPL, MSFT or NVDA which would you choose and why? I have all three and am wondering which I should prioritize over the coming months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:43:51'] Playing ER for $COIN is risky imo. Anytime sentiment is already overly negative into a print, the company has a better chance of a positive surprise. Any positive guidance or a beat on an estimate can screw bears out of their positions

That's weird to say, and the crypto bros will be responding to my comment in earnest about their visions of the future, but the real fact is Coinbase is directly tied to the value of BTC because the majority of their revenue comes from percentage based transaction fees that fluctuate so wildly with crypto market changes. Bitcoin halving will be an absolute deathblow to their current structure. Miners are going to drop like flies with lower rewards, and transaction fees MUST increase to account for the hash demand. Coinbase already has the highest fees of any exchange that their customers don't necessarily appreciate. They're going to need to cut some pretty big deals with their corporate partnerships if they want to keep business. As for retail traders, I don't know what they can do.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 04:43:47'] There's a few. First off, COIN has taken a huge beating of late and has shown strong resistance at the $50 - $60 mark, a lot of negatives are already baked in at that price to the point you won't find many sellers IMO.The BIG reason to be careful about shorting is one that no one has mentioned (as far as I can see) and that could crush a short position - the **Ripple v SEC lawsuit**. I won't go into all the details, but basically its a court case which has the potential to send an earthquake through the cryptosphere. If Ripple wins there will a big upshoot on the value of all crypto and the opposite if they lose - summary judgement should happen over the coming weeks/next couple of months. Finally, Bitcoin has doubled in value since the last earnings and COIN have made staffing cuts I could be wrong, but I think they'll post a nice PES in the next Q.

They're actively trying to freeze his assets to protect what investors they can. They're also continuing to build their case against Coinbase. All of this negative news could be very destructive for faith and trust of big investors in crypto and could result in a crash. If ever there was a time to short Coinbase it might be now.

Corning makes a variety of different components and supplies many of the top electronics companies, like Samsung and Apple, which reports earnings this week amid concern over slowing consumer electronics sales. But there is optimism that slowing electronics sales wont hurt the high-end of the market as much as less expensive devices. Corning said it expected $3.55 billion in core, or adjusted, sales for the fourth quarter, short of a FactSet analyst consensus of $3.75 billion.\n\nThe company said that it would wait to see positive signs before telling investors about future recovery in the business. In the quarter ending in September, Corning saw smartphone unit sales decline 14% on an annual basis, and tablet and notebook demand fall 17%, Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said on an earnings call. He added that annual automotive p'

POST_TEXT: b'The Google-Facebook online ad duopoly may be breaking up. According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam. The research, based on an analysis of the online ad budgets of over 100 different consumer app companies, found that Apples ad business has benefited from the companys major iOS privacy update in 2021, which made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track users across the Internet. Apples search ads let people advertise on the iPhone makers App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Googles rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.\n\nApple has joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption, according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi. Shumel Lais, general manager at Appsumer, attributed A'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 06:01:47'] As someone who works in the app dev/advertising space, Apple has the most aggressive and expensive ad platform of them all, it's now completely pay to win on the app store. Apple doesn't care about app quality for search ranking anymore, as long as you're paying them ungodly amounts of advertising money and not blatantly violating their TOS or copyright law they'll boost you to the top. Long gone are the days of a more 'curated' experience on the App Store.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 06:21:10'] Is this not considered as an antitrust thing?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 04:31:38'] Isn't this evidence of Apple having such strong control over their 'own' customers, pretty much a monopoly? Pointing fingers at Google and Facebook feels like a distraction.For investing, I worry that if the gov sees it this way as well, they will clamp down on this practice either by saying Apple can't use this personal data either, or that any public data (browsing or usage outside Apple web pages/apps etc) must be available to other advertising providers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 01:42:52'] Funny how reports follow stock sentiment. Could've also studied meta challenging apple's dominance in hardware with its headsets. But nah, that won't get as many clicks right now.It's almost as if the reports and news are trying to cater to current popular sentiment. How strange.By the way, Apple is a great company that I very much hope to buy in the future. The meta hate, however, is reaching Alibaba level insanity.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-05 22:21:40'] I was looking at free cash flow minus share based compensation for the past 4 quarters.Apple has a 25 pfcf which grew double digits.Google has 29 pfcf and meta has 17 pfcf. Both experienced double digit declines.More disruption ahead.Microsoft and Apple are the only two big tech companies with double digit fcf growth.We‚Äôll have to see if google and meta can recover their fcf in 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 08:25:31'] And there's the rub. Apple isn't protecting your privacy by cutting Facebook off from user data. Apple is just crushing competition on the way to running their own adtech on their own hardware/OS.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 09:16:56'] I own stock in both Apple and Meta, but this sort of concerns me from a monopolistic point of view. I doubt Apple follows the name rules about ad targeting as Meta and Google now have to follow. Apple basically hobbled other advertisers with the tracking chances and is now seeing its ad business explode.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 09:59:45'] As someone in the adtech industry, Apple isn‚Äôt even close to them.Facebook and Google are absolute behemoths in digital advertising. Google especially, and they play very dirty to maintain that. Publishers are 1,000% at Google‚Äôs mercy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 14:41:38'] If you are only up a few hundred total, imo you are better off leaving as is and buying into an etf with new money. Taking the small profits won't do much ofr you.  However,  if you no longer believe in the companies based on new information I'd sell all of it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 14:20:39'] You could sell a chunk of those and put the proceeds into QQQ. That lets you stay heavily invested in those companies but reduce the concentration risk, as the index automatically reallocates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 14:59:59'] Depends on how much profit you have experienced and how long you have held. If it is a small percentage gain, it might not be worth taking profits and being taxed. I‚Äôd consider rotating the profits into a broader market fund while holding some of the original investment - turn on DRIP and let all ride since all of it will still be around long-term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:10:43'] Sell half and buy back slowly

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:53:18'] Take the win and move on. Stocks rarely survive 10 years in public markets
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:59:52'] Depends. Since it sounds like non-retirement, take your gains as you please and leave the original investment. If you decide to wait, yes there‚Äôs a good chance that stocks like those will grow, but you‚Äôll have even bigger tax obligations. Determine a year that you feel good about taking a tax hit and potentially increasing your annual income.Also; what was your original plan with these stocks? Was your plan to make short plays or are your eyes just getting big? If you have a sound plan that doesn‚Äôt involve selling now, stick with it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 19:43:28'] Sell all and put it in an index fund, then leave it. Market cap weighted funds will still give you significant exposure to these companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 04:50:06'] If you're holding for a decade plus, the index is a good choice. I only actively trade individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 05:43:13'] I'm still holding onto my Google, apple, and Microsoft despite the gains. My investing thesis hasn't changed and I don't think they are absurdly valued. All of the best investors encourage having a high school threshold for selling.I might take some Nvidia profits if I had it because it just seems absurd.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:37:21'] I was in the same position. I think its smart to hold great companies and not worry about their year to year performance. So I am still holding Google, MsFt, Meta. However I did sell out of Nvidia. I still love the company and will buy back in if it drops but I considered it way to over priced.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 15:17:23'] People usually buy more mega cap stocks over etfs which is stupid because etfs are already heavy on mega cap stocks, definitely it's better take profit if a mega cap stock is trades higher than usual because with single stock picks beaten quality stocks should be bought like meta, currently mega caps will have the same movement potential with much higher risk than etfs, totally pointless.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 18:16:00'] it could be that there is no other apple or tesla at this time. It's not like there was a new "apple" or "tesla" every year. They are literally unicorns and they come around very rarely...also most people wouldn't recognize them early on. It only becomes evident in hindsight after the stock blows up and then you kick yourself for not buying earlier.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 20:33:07'] I mean it's possible you will have a company rise from the grave like Apple. You have to remember what a big piece of shit that was until the first iPod and iPhone. Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market. Right now it's commodities, but commodity cycles never last that long. I think 2005 to 2008 was probably one of the longer ones

In Healthcare were still stuck in many ways in the past century, brick and mortar visits, measuring vitals and health in an office or hospital. The population is aging far beyond what the Healthcare system is build to handle and far beyond what it can scale to meet the future demands. There's no way around it that I can see.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 18:47:34'] I think that Tesla, Apple, and Amazon will continue to do really well over the next decade.But I think that the big stock of the decade will be Nvidia since they are involved in several big emerging industries (cloud services, autonomous driving, IoT, crypto, artificial intelligence, genomics, metaverse, etc.).No matter what you imagine the future will be like, at the core of those fantasies will be computing power which Nvidia will be providing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 09:32:37'] Might be better to look at what the hot new thing might be.I hate to admit it, but possibly that's virtual reality stuff.  Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?Trouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.MSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.What you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?As for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?

Tesla at one point in time had continuous production delays, losses every quarter, and on the verge of bankruptcy. Investing at that time was risky. Elon himself said they were very close to going under. Any potential 10 bagger will have its own risks. I would recommend looking at some of the Chinese equities, jd for example. If things go right and regulatory fud goes away, could be a big winner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 22:28:06'] NVIDIA. I believe their work with AI and the massive head start they‚Äôve had will make them a dominant force in the tech industry once AI begins to directly get into the hands of consumers. They‚Äôve developed AI for self driving cars, have used machine learning to automate a lot of tasks developers, engineers and designers would normally have to do manually. The other day, I realized I could use the NVIDIA AI to reduce noise in my microphone, as well as upscale the resolution of games. While these are small applications that won‚Äôt convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction. Once self driving cars, automated traffic and smart factories become the norm, you can expect NVIDIA to be even more of a juggernaut in the tech industry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 06:54:01'] Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.My call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to "improve" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. "How is that possible?" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The "longest range" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.Also, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to "grow" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..In the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say "I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla"
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 07:38:29'] The best way to try and find this is start with a screen. 1) <$20 billion market capNext, what are the financial qualities of a "decade" stock? Revenue growth. This is tricky though since COVID skewed results both up and down but you will still have many companies. 2) 5 year annual revenue growth >20%Good balance sheet. None of the companies mentioned in the original thread ever had any material debt.3) Debt/MktCap < .2It is hard to get the list much smaller with quantitative measures without eliminating potential contenders.The nest step is really about picking the industry that will see the next winner. Healthcare? Software? Consumer? The next winner is likely to come from a different sector than the last decade.

The bbby filings also hinted at mysterious buyers that never came I also made money on this play before was my biggest trade last year in August but anyway I bought back in and I kept buying the dipOnly problem was it kept dipping! And fast as hell. I would wake up and it's 20 percent down. The problem was the board... Every significant price increase the board would drop an AH filing that crushed any returnI was actually positive by 1k on the Feb run up to 7 but those gains were quickly taken by an AH filing drop announcing dilutionThe whole play didn't make sense either as it has become a saying to hold out of sheer confusionI eventually sold when the board admitted in one of there filings they didn't understand there loan agreement and the money they raised (300 mil) with dilution had to be paid to the creditors so after seeing there dumb incompetence I finally got outWas a wild ride tho...I'm sad and ashamed it didn't pan out cause I was super bullish but damn that boards crisis management is non existent..set a deadline of April 26th or going bankrupt but schedule the reverse split for May 9th?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 04:45:05'] Delisting doesn't really mean much. Many stocks go through delisting and increase in share price post-delisting... It does mean less liquidity because some brokers won't allow OTC trading, but the big ones like Fidelity and TD Ameritrade do. The reason it's at $0.13 and not higher is not because it's delisting or going bankrupt. If it were just doing those two things, I would be buying a lot more. Once bankruptcy protection is in place, they won't have any debt and could theoretically continue operations. The reason it's 13 cents is because they're also closing all their stores (by end of May). If they close all their stores, they will also have no income... Point is, delisting and bankruptcy does not mean the company ceases to exist. It will still trade OTC and have some inherent brand value. There is also a chance of a buyout of some kind, most likely occurring after bankruptcy procedures are complete, but before closing of stores. The total market cap is around $50m. Once bankruptcy is complete, and debts are erased, any rich guy with a couple hundo sitting around could decide they want to take over, install their son Johnny Tsunami as the CEO, help their son Johnny with the turnaround, then talk to their friend at Walmart and get them to hire Johnny as the WMT CEO. You could construct any number of similar opportunities, but point is, $50m is a low enough price that some nobody could easily buy up a controlling interest in the company. If I had a billion $, I would buy it all today, scrap it for parts, and basically just set up a couple stores using the brand name. I'd cut costs by selling cheaper products at a higher markup. Guess what, BBBY did over $20b in revenue last year. They also spent $20b, but that's still a lot of revenue that I could potentially cut costs on. All I need to do is cut costs by less than half a percent and then I'm generating $50m in profit each year. By owning 100% I can just pay the $50m as a dividend and I get all of it - every year. Pretty amazing return.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 10:18:21'] Oh man, this is like trying to understand why people keep betting on a losing team, right? So here's the thing: some investors just can't resist the temptation of buying bankrupt stocks because they're like moths to a flame when it comes to speculation, potential asset sales, or even the slightest chance of a company bouncing back. They see those dirt-cheap shares and think, "Hey, what if they turn things around?" But let's be real‚Äîplaying with bankrupt stocks is like walking on thin ice. It's risky as hell, and you might end up with a big fat zero if the company goes under for good. Remember, when the bankruptcy Grim Reaper comes knocking, equity holders are usually the last in line to get paid. So yeah, it's a gamble, but some people just can't resist the thrill.

There is also the hope that the bankruptcy not go through giving the stock some value, or that tbe bankruptcy will leave something for shareholders, which never  happens.  Lawyers managing the bankruptcy get paid first, then Creditors get paid. Secured Creditors - often a bank, is paid first. Unsecured Creditors - such as banks, suppliers, and bondholders, have the next claim. Stockholders - owners of the company, have the last claim on assets and may not receive anything if the Secured and Unsecured Creditors' claims are not fully repaid.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 21:53:40'] The +27% intraday move when apple gave them a shout-out during their vision pro presentation just solidified for me that investors don't really understand unity that well. Imo it's not that big of a deal, unity is already big in the VR market and the thing with vision pro proooobably won't affect them as a company that much. There's plenty of other stuff to be excited about with unity, and I feel that investors are sleeping on it a bit. I guess it's out of caution because they had some rough moments in 2022. But I also can't help but think that the company is also a bit misunderstood. If a new VR headset being announced can send the stock flying, I'm looking forward to the next couple years when we see actual noteworthy stuff coming from Unity that will have a more tangible impact on their business.Of course all of this is nonsense talk if they don't have the tech to back it all up. But I'm confident in unity and how they're positioning themselves long-term. It's a great engine, but it's not even only about the engine itself. It's not only about the consumer-facing side of the business either (games), which is what people tend to think of when they think of Unity. In my opinion, in the long term, it's about the increasing prevalence of realtime 3d as an important tool for a growing number of industries. It's about Unity's moat as one of the few full featured, user friendly realtime 3d engines, and by few I mean their only true competition is unreal engine. I'm sorry Godot users. I'm sorry anyone who thinks AAA studios and their (decreasingly used) proprietary engines offer any real notable competition in this space. Making a game engine has always been hard, but it's getting harder, and the further the technology evolves the bigger the moat is gonna get.In the long term I see unity spreading its wings as a 3d software ecosystem that encompasses a variety of (likely paid) tools, and likely with a heavy lean into AI. I also see more industries using these kinds of tools in ways that might not be obvious today.Other companies in this space that get me excited include Nvidia, which I own a bunch of (I lump summed a few years ago), and adobe, but adobe is a little too risky for me since they are already pretty mature as a company, and some of their existing software is falling out of favor. Idk, I'm on the fence about investing in them. Unity is the only company in this space that seems worth accumulating at these prices. I started buying a year ago and am long @$35 a share average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 23:07:46'] I've been in it since IPO where I bought a starter position. During last year I loaded up, with 25x my original shares. I'm still down though, but the plan is to keep them for a decade.Unity has a great product which I know very well from my career. The company is by far the best positioned to take advantage of many current and coming supertrends. I think the whole world will eventually go RT3D. The trouble is dilution. It's one of the single most dilutive stocks I've ever seen. My original shares from IPO at like $69 would be worth $31 now if the company value has stayed the same (which it hasn't).I've written a TON about them on my investment blog, which is linked in my profile - covered every earnings in my monthly journals and written two entire dedicated posts.Great company with an incredible future, but it remains to be seen if shareholders will be rewarded for that, and not just mangement. Be wary.Personally, I'm not buying more shares until the dilution is better under control and the company turns profitable or at least cash flow positive. Those things go hand in hand - without SBC they are already profitable.I liked the ironSource deal - many didn't. But as long as they focus on Create from now on, I really like where Grow is now.

The current price and Apple deal only makes it more attractive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:21:26'] I've had very negative outlook on their business and don't see much prospect in them.* Their CEO is a dipshit who was in charge of EA for years, aka the most consistently voted worst companies in the industry. Said dipshit also called his customers "fucking idiots" for not including predatory MTX as part of their business model. Great leadership amirite.* Last I saw they shut down their help forums, which is very bad for onboarding new users. Not great for expanding revenue.* I've pretty consistently heard from others their product has been circling the drain for years with one pointless half finished feature after another. They're operating in the red to develop and then abandon features.* As for myself I find their engine to be cumbersome as hell to use and I vastly prefer Godot which has exploded in popularity over the last few years and is extremely nice to work in while also allowing devs to keep 100% of revenue. Unity is rapidly losing its niche as the go to engine for indies. There was actually a huge outflux of users from /r/unity and /r/gamedev to /r/godot as a result of the above two points last year. As games take multiple years to develop the delayed effects of this are hard to measure, but I don't see it as a positive for unity.* VR/AR is a hilariously overrated niche that's hard to develop for and represents an exceedingly small amount of the industry's revenue. Every year for the last decade people have been saying it will take off and it never does. A $3k headset certainly isn't going to change that. Maybe in X years it finally will take off, who knows, but I doubt unity will be the one to invest in for that kind of revolution.

The integration with Apple makes it easier to port existing vr games to the Apple device, so more apps/games will be available on launch.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:55:23'] Google is in no way shape or form behind in AI. The Google search engine has been using natural language processing to rank results for years now. This is why backlinks are less important than they used to be. There was a time when backlinks were the currency by which authority was generated, but since probably 2015, the Google spider has been able to make meaning out of text directly and rank it accordingly.OpenAI launched a UI to a natural language processing engine, much of which was built on the research Google has been doing for a decade and open sourcing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:07:38'] You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.So I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:50:19'] I did pretty similar to you, bought 50 shares when meta was around 90 but I sold at 260. Was always a short term play for me though, I‚Äôd rather hold the nasdaq than shares of meta now that they‚Äôve recovered from their absurdly low valuation.Hindsight and all but I wish I would have put much more into meta. Meta at $90 and a p/e of 13 was probably one of the biggest opportunities I‚Äôve seen in a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:47:57'] > TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly EuropeThough a safer way to play this is to sell some Meta for Google which would also benefit from TikTok ban. That's what I did personally after Meta popped at $240> Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple revealsThe VR market is so small that I think Apple is more likely to expand the total addressable market than they are to take market share from Meta. More VR headset manufacturers leads to more VR developers who will probably develop for both platforms. Biggest problem right now is that there's really no compelling application to use VR, not that Meta's devices are limiting, maybe Apple developers can change that, who knows. Wall Street also hates VR so maybe Apple stock will crater after they announce their investment into it.> Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and youngerBut it doesn't really matter whether people are on Insta or Facebook
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:03:53'] I'm reposting my old comment from July 2022 (possibly a month or two earlier), when shares were about $160 a piece. It is out of date and I added some updates, but I think it gives a 'longer term' outlook and reason to be bullish. I own shares at $170. > META has:> > - Essentially no debt (40B in total liabilities, of which 12B is long term debt. 21B in current liabilities, 1B of which is current debt). [Now 60B in total liabilities, but 9B in long term debt]> - It generated 40B in FCF in 2021, compared to 20B in 2019 and 8B in 2015.

[Edit: Now 13 trailing/forward]> - It's now buying back shares, reducing shares outstanding by 4% last quarter and 1% each of the 2 quarters before that. [Edit: Reduced shares 5% YoY last quarter, doing $9B with $40B authorized as of end of Q1]> - It's forecast to grow between 9-15% the next few years, compared to the past decade of 20 to 40% growth. If it beats that, I'd expect a large revision upwards of the stock price.

You aren't going to find firms as cheap without those major risks anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 21:12:07'] You missed the fact that they have possibly the most widely used piece of software on earth, WhatsApp, with billions of users.This is largely unmonetized today, and represents a huge untapped opportunity if they can somehow find out how to monetize.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 10:35:51'] Dutch East India Company, Mississippi Company, South Sea Company - basically every mega cap equity that existed prior to any regulations or laws put into place to police the marketing / sales of equity securities to the public. And considering the main product that two of those companies were moving.......this was prior to corporate governance really being a notion at all.....
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 08:20:10'] The East India Company. A group of relatively small time investors met in London ~1600, to jointly fund an expedition to the far East to directly procure oriental goods and sell them direct to the English market. Prior to this, the goods had to pass through and be taxed by the ports of the French or Dutch kingdoms, meaning the goods had high final cost in London. At the time, the UK was a proverbial backwater of Europe. The Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese kingdoms were far richer and more influential. From a global perspective, the far East, India and china particularly, was much richer and more developed than Europe. The first voyage, the EIC ship stumbled upon a Portuguese vessel returning to Europe with 1200 tons in goods. The EIC ship engaged in piracy, sacked the Portuguese ship, and returned to London with the booty. This first haul was so profitable, it provided huge returns for the investors. And drove significant investor interest. This set up the EIC for early growth. Growth was soon funded by the issue and broad public sale of shares. Over the next 250 years the EIC would grow to be the largest and most influential company in the world. Eventually amassing an enormous army of more than 200,000 soldiers, de facto ruling over the entire Indian subcontinent and beyond. The purpose of which was to monopolize the trade of all of India. At one point, EIC trade accounted for 1/4 of the English economy. The EIC grew so large that the power of the company threatened English democracy, and they had to be dismantled. and India taken over by the British government and administered as a colony. But britain, the country, didn't conquer India, the EIC did. The rise of the EIC and the volume of wealth it generated was a major factor in the rise of Britain, from a weak, small and far flung isolated island nation, to a global powerhouse. This wealth was the primary source of capital that drove Britains other expeditions and colonization of the rest of the world. The effects of this rise to power continue to shape the world today. If there had been no EIC, chances are we wouldnt be sitting here communicating in English. The USA potentially wouldn't exist as we know it. Global history over the last 400 years would have played out very differently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:25:06'] Moving *from* apple and Microsoft to Amazon? No, that's a terrible idea. If you have additional income that you are investing in stocks, it's fine to put a bit into amazon right now. You missed a lot of the run up for the year, but there's still a lot more room to go up than down and a really good 5 year trajectory. But it's really only worth it if you are in the buy and hold mindset, if you are just chasing momentum then you should prepare to be disappointed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 04:54:08'] First and foremost do a personal finance check. Does your income allow you to cover your expenses, continue saving and have an emergency fund? Do you have ample funds set aside to cover at least 6 months of living expenses should an emergency strike and you lose your income? Are you maxing out tax advantaged accounts before investing in taxable brokerages? If your personal finance is solid and you are ready to invest, I‚Äôd start by building up a core of solid etfs. I like VTI for domestic and vwo for international (it‚Äôs emerging market, if you want a total world for less risk you can look at VTIAX). Or just go VT for total world market

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 09:09:24'] A lot of people are talking about 401(k) and IRA, but it depends on your personal tax situation.  If you had an employer offering a 401(k) match (unfortunately you don‚Äôt), then by all means get that free money. But if your income is not that high, then the tax benefit of a 401(k) or IRA or similar tax break is probably not that much.  Compare that benefit to the future tax benefit of putting that money in a Roth IRA instead.  Basically you need to decide which tax break is better for you.  For a lot of people, the Roth is better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 06:06:06'] Educate yourself to the point that you don't need or want other people's advice on which securities to buy. Before you know that, there is little use in investing as you'll have no clue what you are doing or why a stock-pick someone gave you did(n't) do well. It took me years to grasp the basics of it and I keep learning every day. It takes a **lot** of work and self-study so you'll need to be intrinsically motivated, but there's no such thing as free money so if you want to profit you'll have to make your miles studying. Studying in this case isn't watching video's but reading books. There are youtube summaries of books but you won't sufficiently grasp the books through video-summaries. You'll have to read them yourself.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 19:02:37'] You can either invest it in bank CDs which have the least risk and the lowest returns, etfs which have lowish risk and higher returns, or individual stocks which have higher risk and potentially highest return.Other commenters here have listed many good etfs to invest in, most banks should offer a CD around 4-5% annual rate, and for individual stocks never invest in a company that doesn't have a solid product and a good future for that product unless you're willing to take on a lot of risk.I don't know how many people have mentioned this but the QQQ etf looks very nice since it's closely based on the NASDAQ which is the most volatile of the major indexes but has the biggest growth potential and thus the biggest return.Right now the economic conditions are unstable so I don't know whether I'd invest in anything other than a CD in a bank you trust.

The rest you can invest in VOO.  But first make sure your employer doesn‚Äôt offer matching 401k or HSA.  That is free money in a tax deferred account.  You can still invest in VOO or similar S&P 500 fund in those accounts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 10:36:43'] Try to see if you can max out your employer‚Äôs 401k. That‚Äôs about 22,500 plus the free money they give you. You probably won‚Äôt get returns like that anywhere. If you are unsure about what to invest in you can park your funds into a stable fund that doesn‚Äôt change but still can earn interest in a money market fund at 4.5% or so. Before invest learn more about selling options - cash secured puts and covered call. Do NOT buy any stock or ETFs at full price because you can get them at discount. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:04:25'] I'm seeing many already established, often outlandishly high P/E companies here that would have been a good investment some time ago.Full Disclosure: I own shares in the company that I will now briefly talk about. I consider it a great investment right now (I'm not responsible for any losses).Westlake Chemical Corporation (WCC). First let us talk about past performance and financial metrics. WCC over the last 10 years has shown a 10 year median return of ROE of 21,4% and a ROIC of 14,5%. When one considered the ROIC it seems like a company that seems rather cyclical and is rather sensitive to major crisis (ROIC 2008=-1.67% and 2019/20= +3-4%). That 14,5% is with the years of corona included. So the upside is a generally high ROIC, but a high variance of the ROIC. The company has been profitable 19 out of the last 20 years (with the year of unprofitability being the banking crisis in 2008). So the return side looks solid, even if I'd rather have less cyclicality.Let us consider the growth. The story here is similar. 10-year average growth rates are 16% for revenue, 19,7% on assets, 26,2% of FCF and 19,7% for EPS. It is nice that ROE is mostly greater than the growth rates, indicating that the growth is sustainable. This growth also seems not to driven only by aquisitions and the issuence of debt. There have been two aquisitions made and in parts financed by debt in the last 10 years and the business is far from overly leveraged ($4.88B debt and $2.23B cash on hand with a marketcap of $15.1B). The 10 year median margins I do not know enough about to compare to industry standarts, but they seem high with Gross profit margin of 24,4%, EBIT 18.1% and FCF-margin of 11.1%. Maybe someone more knowledgeable about the industry can weigh in here. The company is also buying back shares, even if not at an emormous rate.And all of that for a P/E of 6,8.To me that seems like a conservatively run company, by a management that makes sensible and careful business decisions, with good profitability and good growth and low debt. For me this is a "no-brainer" stock, although it isn't perfect, which is why i have just recently bought the stock and gave it significant weight in my portfolio. A personal problem is that I do not know enough about plastics and coatings, which is their business, but every other metric checks out for me.I would be happy to hear any criticism of the company, as it then might improve how I look at companies in the future. Good luck and thanks :)

If I had to buy something right now, it would probably be Whirlpool. I know boring but 5% dividend that looks very safe, aggressively buying back shares, probably the best value home appliance company with a good reputation, and trading at a fcf of 8x and a 5 year PE of 9x. I recently had to purchase a washer & dryer so my deep dive on home appliances put Whirlpool on my radar.

Regardless they will capitalize on distressed, cheap assets that few can reasonably acquire/maintain. They‚Äôve got a ton of liquidity sitting on the sidelines waiting for investment. I think the entry price is more than fair right now. It dipped into bargain territory as it went under $29. Their moat is undeniable, while their balance sheet convoluted as it is, is a fortress (most of their debt is non-recourse).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 20:51:46'] 2022 total EV production was around 800k. Tesla was around 550k of that 800k. In 2023 they are estimated to produce around 1.2 million car. More than double. They are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. In comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That‚Äôs per company. There isn‚Äôt a company that can produce at Tesla‚Äôs speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it‚Äôs going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That‚Äôs 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that‚Äôs a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. I know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. Tesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That‚Äôs 14 years. That‚Äôs millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla. By the time the other companies catch up it will be too late. Tesla is KING!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 23:45:29'] I like Roku, it's already up 60% this year and has more room to go. It's taking more share of advertising dollars as more ad spent shifts to streaming TV away from linear TV + there is extra upside from mobile ads based on Apple's digital privacy changes. When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear.

But it‚Äôll bounce back no matter what.Otherwise, if we get a bigger banking crisis which for whatever reason can‚Äôt be averted by the fed, Jpm, etc, they might drop as well.If you mean dropping due to actual devaluation of the company itself(and not macro factors), I just don‚Äôt see it happening any time soon, possibly ever.

The amount of sheep that buy into their products with little understanding that they are LEGITIMATELY being scammed blows my mind. I could list for hours all the cons and small scams that apple pulls on each of their devices but thats not what this sub is for. Why apples successful? People purely love apple for its aesthetic, "celebrity status" and easy to use OS, which masks the list of issues in its design and limited lifetime use. If only the cost actually reflected what you got.The swing to android has slowly started to increase as their phones continue to prove valuable and durable.Imo, and this is not financial advice. Ride the apple stock train but watch for the social clues to know when to jump. Proven by pictures, meetings and documents of hedgefunds, Apple talks quite often with big hedgefunds (such as citadel). Theres now way they would let Apple tank.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 21:33:08'] Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. &#x200B;*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*    *A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that‚Äôs been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald‚Äôs was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald‚Äôs could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with McDonald‚Äôs. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*    *And if McDonald‚Äôs was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot‚Äôs company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*    *If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you‚Äôd just be breaking even today.*    *I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: ‚ÄúDue to the recent bankruptcy, we‚Äôre removing this stock from our buy list.‚Äù In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I‚Äôve ever seen before or since.*    *You often hear about companies whose future performance is ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù in the stock price. If that‚Äôs the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*    *When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64‚Äîthough nowhere near as extreme as EDS‚Äôs. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It‚Äôs a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon‚Äôs earnings didn‚Äôt grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18‚Öù in 1974.*    *The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*    *The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14‚Öõ in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid‚Äôs p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*    *Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn‚Äôt have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 20:49:09'] Okay but is there a catalyst? TSLA has been overvalued as hell too and if you bought puts at $300 before it fell to $100 in January you'd be a genius, but shorts have lost an insane amount of money better against it on the way up.

It has so much downside that it's a far far better risk-reward proposition if you wait until it confirms its price has turned downward. Nobody here should be shorting in front of a tidal wave.

Ranging from the recent move in bonds, to gold, to market fragility, to the overall risk-asset rally, etc. But I do not want to post a whole essay on everything, so I left the original explanation short and sweet.That being said, we are seriously one bad china news event from semis being blown up. If you have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, they can tell you how bad the situation has become over the past few years. US investors are seriously underestimating the probability of China‚Äôs interference in Taiwan. It‚Äôs not a matter of if, it‚Äôs a matter of when. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre going to have a full-on invasion, they are going to be much more surgical than that. There will be a bold move they make soon and it will be a minsky moment where US investors assign a non-zero chance that TSMC could be at risk in the future. The moment investors wake up, is the moment panic sets in.Look at what happened to $BABA and $JD when sleepy china cracked down on VIEs‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 07:58:42'] Couldn't agree more, my summary is below, the points are in more detail in this video [https://youtu.be/gtRU\_6mj4k4](https://youtu.be/gtRU_6mj4k4) &#x200B;To cut a long story short I think it's 50/50 for this quarter but that the next quarters are going to bring much softer results. Here's some bullet points of why:      Covid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.    AI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.    High Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.    Insider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.    If you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:24:12'] So I have learned my lesson on shorting or buying puts early. What you want to do is buy long exp put spreads, usually twice as long exp wise as you think you‚Äôll need. So for Nvda, buy put spreads expiring at least in July, if not September. That way you‚Äôll be protected from theta, and if the price runs, you can buy back the short and have more upside if your spirit has not been broken by that point. And If the stock does fall, you‚Äôll be able to sell for a gain.Another option is to short the stock while buying puts 5-10 strikes out of the money. You won‚Äôt net much but you‚Äôll be able to sleep at night if the stock runs up a bit

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 06:44:13'] Their puts are already quite expensive.  October 260 puts at current prices would need at least a 10% drop from here to get in the money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:10:28'] I already got burned messing with this. I‚Äôm done with shorting, things may go that way eventually but that does not mean I will make money
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:28:47'] Agreed, market timing can be a bitch though so i have about 25k in summer 2024 LEAPs
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:58:41'] Just some clarification:The reason I go for shorter-dated, far OTM puts is because timing is impossible for these kinds of shorts. Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.Whereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 09:09:31'] Nvidia deserves to be the darling of the stock world with AI rapidly developing. However, it‚Äôs very overvalued based on whatever money it can make in the near future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 09:23:26'] AI hasn't been on the back burner, NVDA was $5 split-adjusted before their AI workload revenue started pouring in. There have been many billions of dollars invested by several tech giants and quite a few well funded startups on the software and hardware side.The only thing that has changed is an urgency to talk about it in public to pump stocks. Jensen Huang has been pumping this narrative at every opportunity for a few years already, but mainstream media didn't pay attention because it was boring until dummies could sign up for a free account and have it write as essay for them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 11:03:12'] In the past companies have made specialised hardware to replace expensive power hungry generic one. FPGAs or ASICS can be programmed to do what nvidias gpu do.

If nvidia stuck to making gpus then i dont think it ll stay in the game long term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 14:40:15'] Just to add a cherry on top, on the consumer side they‚Äôve drastically inflated prices for their graphics cards after they realized people were paying higher prices to scalpers, while at the same time providing virtually no price to performance gains.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wnmb4m/michael_burry_apple_put/'
POST_TEXT: b'A couple months ago Michael Burry bought a put position when AAPL was under $140 and made the position almost 20% of his portfolio. \n\nAAPL is now at $171. What are your thoughts on his position and do you think his position could be in the money any time soon?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 14:19:53'] The position is definitely not 20% of his portfolio. 13F counts the underlying shares in the option as its value instead of the value of the option itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 13:01:42'] Didn‚Äôt he put that position on at the same time as long GOOG or one of the other mega caps as part of a (sort of) spread trade? I may be misremembering. Either way, it‚Äôs more interesting than it is useful to know.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:20:11'] Maybe he's not wrong, maybe he's just early
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 16:10:30'] Puts on Apple probably have more to do with Market in general‚Ä¶.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 18:30:56'] overall Burry's a very smart guy and capable investor. nobody bats a thousand but he's made some very good moves and people ignore him at their peril.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:17:59'] Maybe he sold already?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 21:37:59'] The ignorance in this sub is staggering
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 14:14:59'] He‚Äôs looked at like some sort of genius for basically being permanently negative(even a broken clock is right 2 times a day). The only reason he has any money is because he‚Äôs an asset manager. Weird how he invests other people‚Äôs money like the market is going to go up. In fact, His fund at Scion Asset Management has over 35 million shares of Apple. The largest holding in their portfolio btw.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 15:02:24'] >AAPL is now at $171. What are your thoughts on his position and do you think his position could be in the money any time soon?First that 20% is the nominal value, not the real value of what he paid for that option and the strike price.Second he reduced his riks portfolio by a huge amount. He was managing more than 5x the amount of money that his latest 13f showed (on monday there should be a new one). Knowing this information, I doubt that this position is more than 1-2% of his portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 17:05:05'] If he‚Äôs really as good as he says he probably closed that position when AAPL had two closed above $151. Most pros don‚Äôt HODL. When the thesis turns on them they bail. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pros.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-14 05:06:17'] Degenerate gambler.  He'll lose it all eventually

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 14:13:58'] He seems to be a good investor, but if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that Christian Bale played him in a movie once people wouldn‚Äôt listen to him that much. Still worth learning from, but I really don‚Äôt think he should be as watched as someone like Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio, Bill Ackman, Seth Klarman (and even those guys can get goofy at times.)

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:28:45'] He‚Äôs used to holding what everybody else considers to be stupid for a very long time so I‚Äôd expect him to let it play out. He‚Äôs right often enough to let it play out I think m.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 13:19:17'] I‚Äôm almost certain he _shorted_ AAPL when it was around 160-165. So he definitely closed out most, if not all of his position when it dropped <130.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:18:35'] According to many indicators the bottom was in June. He is fucked.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:31:58'] Someone should ask him on Twitter how that position is treating him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:52:04'] He is human being ... Some bets he loses. Others you win. That is just life.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 14:32:19'] I always hear how great of an investor he is, BUT, doesn‚Äôt seem to hold up.  What am I missing?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 15:35:57'] Burry made a ton of money during the real estate bubble, but he took years of losses against the position until the market blew up. He‚Äôs probably ok riding it for a bit

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-14 10:28:12'] i thought he bought the position when Apple was in $160-170s before the drop but then it was reported when Apple was in $130s-140s so I think he sold and made money? anyone confirm or deny this?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-14 10:56:32'] It appears to just be a hedge in context of scions other positions. Don‚Äôt believe selective reporting media on these things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-14 12:09:24'] Michael Burry is a joke.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-14 12:13:38'] I think the biggest thing is that the 13F is what is known at the time of reporting.There's no rule that says he didn't open some positions the day of, close the day after reporting.the filing date was 05-16-2022 but was for holdings as of 03-31-2022.&#x200B;Around the end of March, Aapl rose from mid march lows of 150's up to 179.  Opening a Put options positions in this range, and the later lows of mid May at 136 would have been profitable depending on the Puts and expiry.&#x200B;I also think Burry has some reported positions which are just to fuck with people who track his 13F filings.  i.e. his old tesla positions etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 12:33:55'] How do you find out other peoples trades? Are they abailable online if big enough?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 15:03:40'] I don't see his position hitting.  It feels like that ship sailed with the market rally, their recent quarter, and a report that iPhone demand is still very high.  I also won't be surprised if they win the bidding battle for NFL Sunday Ticket.  They really need a shot in the arm for Apple TV+ and that would do it.  Maybe the market falls apart again and he hits but not fundamentally I don't see the market pulling back enough.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 15:30:12'] He either got out or he is \*ucked.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 18:26:59'] He's probably too early, but the day of reckoning for AAPL will come imo. When the iPhone goes down everything will go down. It could be during this downturn but I don't think so.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 09:05:45'] SCHW deposits fell almost $140B or 30%.  Yet street remains positive, very interesting.I guess the thesis is that there are enough people comfortably being scammed (or unaware?) with 0% APY on their stock brokerage cash that it is sustainable eventually.I expect retail deposits for normal banking to be stable at 0%.  Most people have only a few thousand dollars in their accounts and don't pay super close attention to yield.  That said, I would think the sensitivity to be higher for active investors but maybe I am wrong on this.Edit: u/AP9384629344432 to clarify I agree most people don't move checking money.  My point is that SCHW gets almost all their deposits by screwing over their trading accounts not checking.So not sure which broker you use but I use Fidelity.  All my cash gets swept to 4.5% MMF at the end of every day if I don't use it.SCHW on the other hand sweeps it to their subsidiary Schwab Bank for 0.4% and treats it as a deposit, does that make sense?  As a bank holding company they have to keep them separate but can have affiliate relationships.  I am surprised that SCHW traders are okay with this.  This is how Schwab funds their loan portfolio from their 10K:https://i.imgur.com/DhmSkN2.pngIt is almost entirely funded by traders that are not using their cash at all.  I would think they are among the most volatile deposit bases out there??  But apparently I am wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 07:28:20'] I haven‚Äôt made any portfolio changes directly as a result of the AI hype. But I have to say, the more anecdotal use cases that I‚Äôm seeing at my employer, the more I‚Äôm finding myself starting to buy into the hype. My years of experience are telling me to keep the guardrails up any time there is hype.I was a brand new investor during the dot com bust and I remember the feeling of invincibility picking stocks that would double and triple.  There didn‚Äôt seem any way to screw it up until the rug pull and multi year grind downwards.  Overall I basically lost just about everything I had put in during that period with the exception of a couple boring stock picks that I still own to this day. Think really boring lol. Even though the stock market went bust back then, the tech revolution that has followed is undeniable. Market caps have swelled beyond anything folks would have thought possible.I wanted to bring this piece of my experience up because the hype feels of a similar quality‚Ä¶not exactly the same, but the early innings hype is there nonetheless.Every once in a while there comes along the potential for a paradigm shift in how society functions. Society and institutions are slow moving beasts and change can only be integrated at a certain pace. The potential is there right now for this to kick into overdrive.What does this do for the stock market? I‚Äôm really not sure. Maybe we get another tech bust after a massive run-up. What I am feeling pretty sure of is the returns over the next 10-20 years are looking really good.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 17:53:32'] [Here are credit card utilization rates among American households](https://i.imgur.com/46ZNjWy.png). Americans post-Covid were *not* maxing out their credit cards anymore than in 2019. We did see credit spending increase the last 2 years. Many said this was evidence of 'consumers entering debt because of a tough economy' while others (myself included) argued this was consumers showing resilience.Now, at the tail end of that graph and alongside retail sales weakening, we see credit card usage going down. To me, *this* is a sign of weakness. And if you argued Americans were debt-binging, well this is a positive trend to you (I don't think it is).What's your narrative?Necessary graphs (some of these are slightly out of date):- [Revolving debt as a share of income](https://i.imgur.com/Ovbuz49.png)- [Household debt payments as percent of income](https://i.imgur.com/jkoRNqt.png)- [Household debt to GDP](https://i.imgur.com/DvoDsJk.png), and compared to [trends around the world](https://i.imgur.com/3AJAdq8.png).- [Household checkings savings](https://i.imgur.com/ElKgOoL.png)By the way, separate from households, but [non-financial corporate interest expenses](https://i.imgur.com/0gG7KcT.png) as a share of operating cash flow have actually been falling over the past few decades (with some spikes in the Dot-Com / housing bubbles).

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-08 19:37:24'] I get the impression that big tech companies are being pressured to expand in all directions to maintain the 'innovative' perception they have among shareholders, even if the expansion doesn't make sense. Is Apple trying to become a bank? Should Google get into grocery delivery now? I wonder if this really is the best use of Apple's money or just what happens when a company is making so much money it just expands in every direction (GE?). Why not just buy back more shares or put toward the primary business which are actually doing well. JPMorgan has a fortress balance sheet but I don't think they should be getting into self driving cars.Maybe unrelated but I see a sentiment whenever companies announce 'expansions' or 'new acquisitions' and everyone's first take is: "ooh exciting, idk what this has implications for but business is growing, buy buy buy."

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 15:14:27'] I have been seeing YouTubers, Redditors, and CNBC bring on a bunch of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù talking about this upcoming earnings. You would think with all this talk about it if Apple misses it would mean the end of the entire market. People are going crazy about it right now and this is my opinion.Apple has always had periods of booms and busts. One year would be really great and the next meh. It has always been like this. The last 2 years have been phenomenal for them so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if we see a slowdown in electronic sales. Right now computer sales have had a big decline across the world. We see this in the Microsoft earnings. Microsoft did really bad in their computers and general hardware in their recent earnings. With all this will it surprise me that Apple misses? No. Will it be the heat death of the universe if they do? No. Will it surprise me if Apple beats either? No. Apple has always had a history of beating peoples expectations and it would not surprise me if hardware sales do not decline as much as Microsoft‚Äôs due to the strength that the Apple ecosystem has shown in the past.Apple has also been moving more towards subscriptions and financial services. Very high margins and so far has been growing every single quarter. This can probably also soften the blow if there is a decline in the hardware side of their business. The way I look at it is whatever happens happens. If we see a beat I am ok with it. If we see a decline I am also ok with it. I can see it going both ways however I want to lean more towards a miss. Apple is currently approaching all time highs and I would love to see the stock pull back some so I can add to my current position.

I just bought more shares in case the price jumps after earnings. I figure I can add more if it goes on sale, but at least I have the minimum number of desired shares now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 07:19:25'] Have you ever had to deploy a fleet of Microsoft Surface laptops? They are the biggest pieces of shit on the market. You would think the company that makes the OS would be able to make it stable on their own hardware that they designed. Nope. Utter garbage. Not that their OS is great either, it's just so embedded in enterprise software that companies have no choice but to use it. Once everything goes browser based SaaS, their OS sales are going to tank as well, which isn't a bad thing for them exactly as they had enough foresight to embrace cloud services. MS cloud based services are pretty much the best around for enterprise but they are going to lack the staying power since migrating to other platforms won't be as much of a challenge as it is now.Apple continues to not give 2 shits about enterprise and focuses solely on the consumer market... but then again, as things move towards browser based applications it might not matter as much.

POST_TEXT: b'Not to say the market has been held up obviously. Just that without apples relative performance things would be a lot worse.\n\nJust as an example from precovid to ATH apple rose 125% while Microsoft rose 80%. Apple is still up 80% while Microsoft is up only 28%. I understand that both these companies are pretty different & have also been trading at similar PE ratios. \n\nMy purpose in comparing these two is to surmise that a case could be made apple benefitted majorly from the covid environment that we are no longer in. Major demand pulled forward for apple. Shouldnt investors be more worried about apples return to normal level of profits like they have with other mega caps that benefitted majorly from covid?\n\nA huge amount of apples revenue comes from consumers around the world rather than enterprise. Consumers around the world are already in a world of hurt & its going to get worse.\n\nNot to mention like 60% of their revenue comes from Europe? Europe isnt exactly looking like everyone'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 12:34:06'] The simple answer is that not enough people want to sell the stock because they believe it will hold/increase it's value.Aside from their growth and earnings, Apple also buys back a lot of stock which helps prop up the share price.  They have bought back about $80B in stock in the past 12 months, and $80B in the 12 months before that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 11:23:03'] Aapl is the safest good stock in a sense. Unlimited money, moat on moat with no foreseeable competition due to network effects and brand loyalty. No game breaking innovations per se... They're not trying to go the meta route with all the risk that brings but they are consistently generating incremental improvements to just sell enough new iphones. Apple is sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars of cash so they'll never go down. Will they crush indexes forever? Maybe not. But it's an island of safety... A mature company that is also relatively innovative with none of the traditional risks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 11:48:24'] It‚Äôs true, AAPL has done quite a bit to prop up the market. I don‚Äôt see it lasting. The valuation is quite stretched at 25x earnings. That compares to is more typical high teens multiple, which is reasonable for the type of moderate, steady growth AAPL delivers outside of the COVID boom. Multiple compression alone, back to 18, rather than today‚Äôs 25 would put AAPL around 110. Lower than that is quite possible if earnings really take a hit. To justify AAPL‚Äôs current price, you have to believe in continued double digit growth, something the company generally doesn‚Äôt sustain.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 17:23:58'] Simple, people still believe in the short term prospects of Apple, as well as the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 11:26:02'] Apple is generally perceived as a luxury brand. The Apple brand carries significant pricing power and Apple is able to capitalize on this branding. Luxury goods and services are generally less impacted by macro events as the people who are buying these products are people who want to own a product with strong brand recognition. Look at Apple's last [quarterly report](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results/), where they still are reporting increasing sales.This phenomenon isn't just with Apple items. [Luis Vuitton Moet Hennessy is another example of this](https://www.lvmh.com/news-documents/press-releases/excellent-first-half-for-lvmh-26072022-2/), delivering remarkable performance over the first half of this year.Apple also benefits from being integrated with all of the major phone carriers, making it easy for people to upgrade their phone without putting additional capital on the table (people can generally stomach monthly payments for something that they want).
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 15:38:12'] Apple is both a luxury brand and a consumer staple. You won‚Äôt stop using a phone, in fact often times phones are required now, and if you‚Äôre going to have a phone you want the best or at least the best-est you can afford. Often times that is Apple. They also have a huge moat and free cash on hand at 48 billion. They don‚Äôt even have to sell anything for the next 5 years and they‚Äôll still be fine
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 15:42:59'] Why are you comparing Apple to Microsoft? For one Microsoft was trading at a much higher valuation then Apple so it makes sense when the market falls stock‚Äôs that trade higher tend to get hit more. Also Apple has a massive cash flow (I am pretty sure the largest in the market) and most of it goes towards buybacks which helps with the stock price. Apple did like 80 billion last year and they are doing around the same amount this year. Also they are regarded as one of the best businesses in the world. Even Warren Buffet says they are the best company in the world. People view Apple as a very safe investment and the best ran company so it holds up.I read somewhere from a trader that he will know when the market has hit a bottom when people give up completely on Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 16:22:52'] Aapl is a beloved stock. It‚Äôs the last stock people are going to sell in order to free up cash.  Take a look at the daily drawdowns this week, the most sold each day we‚Äôre Russell 2000 and Nasdaq. Dow actually held up better than the rest because it has established companies that could withstand a recession and aren‚Äôt as sensitive to interest rate hikes like high PE growth stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 18:51:49'] Not really. Fundamentals aren't real. More people buy apple calls than Microsoft calls. Could be why
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 02:15:36'] because apple is a cult. You are told in recession to buy stocks of companies that produce something we need. Means food etc. Well people put Apple products above that :D
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 05:20:18'] Apple is hard to predict. I predicted MSFT will do better than Apple at the start of year because it has corporate customers, less supply problems, less dependant on parts purchases and can increase prices for subscriptions at will.Apple on the other hand is consumer, has supply chains, has China in the market mix, and is less resilient to inflation to Microsoft.So far Apple is doing better and I cannot find rational explanation. 5 years ago I thought we were at the end of $800 flagships as $300 phones do what $800 phones do for most people. Apple jacked up prices to $1000-1500 and is continuing to increase mobile OS marketshare on statcounter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 12:18:41'] Apple is a necessity in the world, that's why. If hundreds of millions stopped using an Apple product or service tomorrow, their quality of life and productivity drops. Are there alternatives such as Windows, Android, etc.,? Of course. But too many people are stuck in Apple's ecosystem and these people are unlikely to voluntarily switch unless they abaolutely have no choice. When I went to public school, most of the kids had an iPhone. I am willing to bet there is an even higher % right now using an iPhone. That's all these kids know from a technological aspect. iPhone, Airpods, Macbook, iPad, Apple Watch. If you have an iPhone, your odds of owning another Apple product is incredibly high. If you have multiple products, you're likely using a paid Apple service. Apple ain't going anywhere. That is why people own it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 17:05:09'] People are hiding in Apple. The more people hide the more the olgo‚Äôs keep pace with the buying. Once the market turns and growth takes over Apple will drop in a big way. Unless they release a new game changing product. Which they may do with their glasses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 03:00:06'] All the pros here is probably why we have a way to go to a market bottom. The bulls are so bullish on AAPL that they would rather DCA than to hold on put leaps to negate losses. They are a good company but are considered by some overvalued in the short term vice the long term. Retail Bulls will argue ‚ÄúI will win in 10 years‚Äù - they are probably correct.The amount of people that will buy an iPhone for a ‚Äúbetter camera‚Äù is astounding. There‚Äôs like a brand loyalty retardation to pay excess prices not using a fat portion of the features paid for.I think the idea is that the poors will be too poor to make their poor decision to pay AAPL prices for the short term - which can lead to lower earnings soon.Completely aside from company performance there are all the stock specific pros as well. AAPL bulls are so bullish you may as well buy because they can‚Äôt stop buying. Self-fulfilling prophecy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 07:39:50'] Delta calls are skewed towards high beta stocks.  Bulls keep buying the dip. (I am quoting)If a stock goes up a buck, the delta is the correlation between that price increase and the option price.  Options are cheaper than stocks so it's not 1 to 1 but gets closer to 1 to 1 if it gets closer to the strike price.Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility.  Delta calls in this case are playing off bulls continually buying the dip because they are relentlessly doing so.  SPX is therefore reacting negatively to having any company but Apple in its index.TL;DR: All of the S&P that isn't Apple is more volatile because Apple Bulls are relentless.  Other portions of the S&P are capitulating at a rate higher than Apple.My guess: foreign money is relentlessly buying Apple dips.  The Federal Reserve doesn't want this and Apple is extraordinarily expensive in non-US currency.  Apple is turning into a foreign Treasury fund.  Eventually American fund capitulation will show up when foreign money dries up.  This will further slaughter foreign currencies.  Europe's piper will be paid in losses unless they meaningfully act as the emerging market the European Union has basically turned into.  Manufacturing is rushing out of Europe for basically anywhere.  Furloughs are going to happen.  This shrinks the tax base.It's crazy what this means Apple stock has become.  If BRK capitulates watch the fuck out.  Because they very well could and start buying Europe or England.  And I say this based off Buffet's famous be greedy when others are fearful.

Maybe not the best source (just the first result i found), but [this article](https://www.imore.com/apple-takes-75-smartphone-profits-despite-13-market-share-says-report) say they captured 75% of all profits in the smartphone market, despite a much much lower share of units sold.Further more they are extremely good in drawing and keeping people in their ecosystem. Once you e.g. have an iphone you are also likely go get a mac, ipad or airpods (those actually make a ton of money). And on the service side they get a 30% cut from the app store and you are likely to use icloud or appleTV over competitors.Copare that for example to Sony which at the start of a new generation often sells their consoles at a loss for some time (and then makes up for it in taking a cut on game sales and stuff).

Between Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, Apple gained 160 million subscriptions year over year, going from 700 million to 860 million. Apple has huge pricing power over these subscriptions they‚Äôre not completely utilizing yet because they‚Äôre focusing on growing subscription numbers first to lock customers in their ecosystem.This doesn‚Äôt even cover the huge brand loyalty for their products or their longshots. 87% of teens own an iPhone, and 88% of teens say their next phone will be an iPhone, according to Piper Sandler.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 19:46:50'] I love Affirm. There are a lot of things I've bought through it that I normally wouldn't because I hate, hate, hate, dropping hundreds of dollars at once even though I have the money for disposal. I got my Xbox, Fitbit, couple of pairs of Ray Ban (prescription) glasses through them. An elliptical, clothing, etc. And the best part. 0 interest if you do a down payment followed by 4 payments, one every week. No interest. No fees. You just pay back what you spent. They have loans as well, one payment a month. For an Xbox series s the interest comes out to about $25 over 6 months. I never went with the loans though. I chose the one down payment followed by 4 payments. Not having to lay interest is great.

I've had stocks I bought then dropped 30% or more after a period of time.. you got to have a stomach to ride through buy the dip? or cut your losses.I suggest start simple, on ETFs.. do your time to study the terminologies and mechanics behind it.. listen to investing OGs like Jack Bogle, Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet and Munger to keep you anchored in the fundamentals and have a clear picture of the personal traits you need once you start in a life long hobby.my tops stocks are MSFT, AAPL, JPM, GOOG, AMD, COST, LOW, GS and AMZN. and then a bunch of smaller stocks less than 3% each.Congrats too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:46:22'] If you want to invest for the long term, your better off putting it into an index fund like the S&P 500.  It will let you have a tiny piece of the top 500 stocks in america, and it is a much safer bet than individually picking stocks.  When people individually pick stocks, 9/10 they end up performing less than if they just put their money in the SP500.   This even goes for economic professionals (see Jim Cramer lol).  I would also recommend putting some into the international fund, that way you aren't putting all your bets into the United States.  In the future, India may become an economic world superpower.

Google may very well know about the owie on your private bits, which is scary, but they might also know what to do about it, which is exciting.  The medical stuff  is also what IBM's Watson was set to after it won jeopardy.  Google bought 3 or 4 other AI type things in 2012 and 2013.     This stuff is like decade old news, or has been in the pipeline for a decade.   I wonder if something hasn't been cobbled together from what they had and rushed to production release to capture headlines now that this tech is in the public eye again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 06:51:35'] Call me old fashioned but I don‚Äôt understand how a glorified chat bot brings any future earnings or profitability in a substantial way to a company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 07:29:35'] It will be interesting to see if Bard will be able to make a real conversation in the UI or if it is just restricted to a single search query.The way ChatGPT can be used is way broader than just a single search query. Many people are making a real conversation with it as a stepwise approach towards their goals. And the conversations can be saved for later which is a real deal for those who are working with it.However, I expect them (at Google) to be intelligent enough to understand that they have to be fast and match the functionality of ChatGPT + up-to-date data as early as possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 07:33:56'] I don‚Äôt know how good this is for anybody. Chatgpt was fun and all, but I don‚Äôt think anyone planned to use it for actually looking up info, nor was anyone considering switching to Bing.I really love and trust the way google assistant does things today.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 19:50:04'] The beauty of chat gpt is it gives you the answer you were looking for 90% of the time, all without ads, a million buttons and crap all over the screen and it‚Äôs concise instead of wordy like almost all internet content is written. It‚Äôs pure, text based, informational, helpful. Any kind of browser search based tool is ruined by annoying SEO, ads, bad looking websites, etc. takes me like 2 minutes and a bunch of scrolling around, sometimes clicking through 5 different links before I find the information I need on google. Chat gpt just gives you the thing you want instantly, and it allows you ask follow up questions. So from a research and information gathering perspective chat gpt blows google out of the water. It has limitations for sure but I‚Äôll never go back to only using google for everything

POST_TEXT: b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-hits-3-trillion-market-cap-184825195.html\n\nApple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.\n\nApples rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.\n\nApples rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.\n\nApples latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance make'

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 12:41:45'] So if I'm looking at the chart correctly, AAPL took like 33 years to hit $1 trillion, then 2 years to hit $2 trillion, and then just 16 months to hit $3 trillion.  I don't even have an opinion on whether it's justified, just want to say that is some crazy shit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 18:45:10'] Despite its massive size, Apple is still an innovative company. High performance RISC chips starting with the M1 are almost revolutionary in what they imply for performance per watt. And the M1 was just the very first generation. It seems very likely that as the architecture matures, it will render x86 obsolete. Qualcomm plans to compete with desktop-class RISC chips of their own for the PC market. And maybe Intel and AMD will be forced to as well. But right now, Apple has a serious first mover advantage with reasonably priced, high performance, low power computers. People think of Apple as only the high-end option, but they actually have great selection at lower price points too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 13:51:33'] AAPL is pretty amazing in their success.  Kudos to them.I am a bit cautious though.  Their market cap has tripled when their revenues/profits have only doubled, meaning the stock is getting more and more expensive.  At some point they are going to approach the limits of growth and their share price will drop because future growth gets priced-in, so I guess the key thing is to try to get in earlier, ride the wave up, and then enjoy the juicy dividends as they become a cash flow machine instead of a growth machine.  That is still years off and so there's still time to get in, even if it is getting pricey right now.  It's just that there might be opportunities with short-term pullbacks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 12:39:50'] Apple is the biggest hit I've had since I began investing. Seems like a no brainer statement, but I'm still pumped.I had been arguing with myself to start investing for three years, and I took the plunge with Apple in 2020. It's currently at about 103% for me, and ballooned to be 50% of that whole account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 15:19:23'] There is a lot of runway left.  Apple TV has managed to take more market share than many expected.  The innovations in chips is what garners the most confidence though.  The more self reliant they can become, the more profitable (and powerful).

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 07:27:30'] For some reason this news reminded me of Co-Founder of Apple Ronald Wayne.He co-founded Apple Computer Company as a partnership with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, providing administrative oversight and documentation for the new venture. Twelve days later, he sold his 10% share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for US$800, and one year later accepted a final US$1,500 to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly incorporated Apple, totaling US$2,300. I also have heard, that those who later on in his life have interacted with him later on have said that he comes off as a very down to earth overall great guy and when it comes to possible regret on this topic, he has none. Which is great and something many of us could learn from:)

Historically when everyone is blinded and bull minded is when we see the most violent stock drops. I've already started trimming and will wait until the fed raises rates to see the reaction before I think about buying again, usually a correction occurs on rates so not only do we have rate rising nearing in 2022 but we have a really insane run up of the market on top of this catalyst.

Apple's air bud market share is 29%.For the phone app market google takes half as much of a cut on a market 5 times the size. Apple is not worth 3 Trillion as a company.

POST_TEXT: b'\nI have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:\n\n* Nvidia\'s advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.\n\n* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.\n\n* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.\n\nWould love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that\'s great as well.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:03:30'] Just buy AVUV in addition to whatever you currently hold if you want to overweight smaller companies. The equal weight ETFs have higher expenses, you'd be better off holding a traditional S&P500 ETF + a targeted small cap fund.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:11:30'] I'd say pick a lane.If you want to be an active investor, do the work. Buy individual companies with strong franchise when they're bargain priced (read: unpopular for no good reason).If you don't want to do the work, buy a broad index, accept the 6-7% returns and focus on work you enjoy.Fiddling around in the market is a wonderful way to get mediocre long term returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:28:00'] I'm definitely geared towards small caps actually. Anything other than big cap tech really. I think recession risk is baked in and that it's not going to be that bad actually so small caps/industrials/financials will do well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:46:07'] > Nvidia's advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaperDo you have a source for this? IMO if hardware for machine learning gets cheaper all that will happen is big companies will buy more of it and use it to train models with more parameters, or train more models at once for hyperparameter selection. I don't see how it would narrow the divide, unless the big models hit diminishing returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 20:12:42'] I am a strong advocate on holding "RSP" type of stocks.  In 2022 if you owned eqw SP500 like rsp you lose -8% less than S&P500 holder.  For a long haul the return is about 12% higher than more volatile S&P on annualized basis. After discussed with several old timer money managers, I like DIA also,  Both RSP and DIA went up 2.15-2.27% today while SPY was up less +1.4%.  Its heavy weight fanng did not move up a lot.  Same with reinvestment etc.I may caution you QQQ is not meant for everyone. My Nov 2021 I added it for comparison and I regret to admit timing was all wrong. Still baghold that index.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 20:20:27']  Tsla, Amzn, Meta, , Goog etc were my most volatile poisons. On a good green day they look superior.  Most of 2022 and this year I had to reduce my positions not to be a huge bag holders like other investors. Most have been weeded.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:57:10'] Imo, the better managed S&P500 is GSPY.         I don't think Joel Greenblatt need any introduction, his hedge fund (Gotham) is managing the etf.      GSPY, GVLU, RPV, SVAL & VNQ is my US basket of ETFs. I'm adding more to GVLU than GSPY lately
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:11:22'] I am personally planning to add an equal-weighted S&P tilt to my portfolio. This is not in order to get mid cap / small cap effect, for me. I just want some part of my portfolio that won't become extremely heavily weighted towards the giant companies.However, market cap weighting will probably remain the core position of my portfolio.

Theres sooo much bureaucratic red tape around regulating products and services and no ones protesting(well not enough are protesting) to get congress involved in any country. BUT the platform makers themselves can do as they wish and since Iphone owns their O.S. (unlike Android which operates through google on manty different phone makers), theyve been known to throttle back and offer a unique product. Mac's were always more secure than PC's now Iphones are more private than Android...theyre playing into a marketting niche I think many may prefer(unless Samsung offers a hefty discount for the same phone performance so they can continue to sell your data).

But NVDA is a core part of the S&P so they would grow together and the S&P could just be named the NVDA index because it is weighted on market cap.

From there, its course was more bullish, and your 1999 reference takes hold.NVDA has had ups *and* downs.  At this valuation, it's too much to buy. (I'm holding because... 50).

POST_TEXT: b'The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon  moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.\n\nThe FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.\n\nThe agency is also reviewing Amazons purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot.\nAny suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.\n\nAlthough Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 22:08:53'] As far as I know, Amazon doesn't have a monopoly in any of the markets it has its toes dipped. This is going to go nowhere. There are no laws that prevent a company from being as heavily diversified as Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 03:05:39'] Nothing is going to happen because they are not a monopoly on anything. And telling them they can no longer grow any more is just about the most anti-American statement anyone can make.So what if they control a lot of retail? Where was the outrage when big box stores were the only players in town and it cost a fortune to open a brick and mortar making it impossible to compete? None of those big stores gave you the option of consignment. All of them imported most of their stuff post 80s. All of them had unwritten agreements about pricing or was it a coincidence that a shirt costs the same today as it did 30 years ago? Goes to show what their margins were.At least now you can compete. Making a website is very cheap and marketing is many time cheaper thanks to the various ways it can be done. Back in the day, all you had was print, tv and radio and it costs thousands a month to get any sort of views. Now you get the same for hundreds.So cry me a river. If it wasnt Amazon then it would have been Walmart. If wasnt Walmart then it would have been someone else.

I think the last thing people will be doing right now is upgrading to the latest and greatest stuff. Honestly, the stock is pretty fair value for their revenue. But it‚Äôs possible the next couple of earnings could start to see a drop in growth, which will greatly affect the stock price. I would probably wait out buying Apple, until consumers start being able to afford these luxuries again.Not to mention, with all these shortages, Apple will most likely have to raise their prices which will result in less consumers. Just my two cents. I‚Äôm holding everything I got right now, and will buy more Tesla if it drops below 700 again. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 02:04:05'] Yes, indeed. The market is dragging almost everything down. My thesis is that the two covid-years were such an anomaly (in terms of sales and stock market prices) that that anomaly is being washed away by the market, resetting everything back to feb-2020 values.For Apple, that will mean back to $81, which I would consider as an immediate buying opportunity. Likewise, back to about $180 for Tesla, which I would also consider a buy. Curiously, Facebook would actually go UP to $218, making today's prices a buy before the reset completes.

If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you\'re looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they\'re giving you a dividend, its such a bonus.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 00:22:00'] Realistically stock picking, especially a mid-somewhat large cap isn‚Äôt easy, heck even for large/mega caps. Just quickly looking at this stock though there‚Äôs a couple things I **personally** don‚Äôt like‚Ä¶ it lacks volume, average volume seems to be about 300k, it‚Äôs a South Korean company, long term chart looks ehh. The P/E can be ‚Äúgreat‚Äù, earnings, financial statements, PRs, etc and the stock might not move how you would expect it, I do believe being a *by the book* trader/investor is great, but it has been a bit out of touch these last several years. Social media and social perception is a huge thing these days. I do think fundamentals will come back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:20:48'] How much do you have invested? Under $1m? Yes do the concentrated portfolio with 4-6 stocks. Companies you can stay on top of. A more diversified portfolio or etf portfolio you sacrifice substantial gains. Of course exposure to risk is much greater but this is how big money is made.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:04:55'] If you‚Äôre interested in learning about investing, I would say start by listening to as many diverse approaches as you can, and see what makes sense, what ideas seem to repeat across different approaches, what types of assets people use, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:06:27'] This guy is a billionaire. When you have billions of dollars you can afford to "just keep buying stocks you like when they're down" indefinitely.It seems like a terrible example to be basing any conclusions about anything on.There is absolutely nothing conservative about his situation. I'm no stock wizard but conservative is usually investing in stuff like ETFs where someone more experienced sells bundles of stuff packaged together. Picking individual stocks with no real experience it's just another form of gambling. Even the most conservative form of picking solo stocks from gut intuition is still very volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:42:18'] Conservative? Then I *think* the most important variable is moat. Which is hard to put a number to. But you can kinda tell who's got it, who don't, and who *really* got it.

POST_TEXT: b'I like and understand his logic for a lot of the things in his portfolio but I was wondering about this one. Did he view Apple as a holdout that had fared better than the overall market, and as such was a put just an insurance policy against the fall of the stock market overall? Or did he view Apple as overpriced considering the shaky condition of the economy? Was a put against Apple more affordable than a SPY put perhaps?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 08:47:44'] His theory is that The massive move into market capitalization weighted indexes such as the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ has resulted into overbuying creating bubbles in their holdings. Because Apple is the largest company by market cap (idk about aramco‚Äôs), it is the most prevalent into any market indices meaning many of its holders are etf holders and not ‚Äúapple‚Äù holdersHe has these puts for around the last six months so he likely already sold them a few months ago when Apple was near the 130 price range for a nice profit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 06:26:51'] It looked like a hedge since he also went on a tech stock buying spree.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 08:01:43'] Probably a hedge and Apple's massive valuation that was well above what it historically should be.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 08:59:58'] I think he had puts because he thought the price was going to drop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 10:17:48'] It's foolish to try and make sense of some of these moves because it's likely that you are already weeks or months behind. He very well may have sold off the puts when Apple was trading in the 130s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 14:34:38'] Pair trade. A semi-arbitrage play on big tech valuation. He went long on GOOGL and META while short on AAPL as there was a valuation gap as AAPL corrected the least during the last several legs down, which created a valuation gap btw it and other big techs, which should close. This thesis has proved to be correct and already played out. Burry was not the only one on this trade. Many macro funds spot the divergence and made similar trades.This play has the beauty of being market neutral (if sized correctly), which was exactly what the doctor ordered during a volatile period like 1H2022. Burry likely already liquidated the AAPL shorts and the GOOGL and META longs.

And yes, your 401K is being shorted because you don't actually own your shares. They're held in street name with said brokers in which lend out your retirement fund to hedge funds to short your retirement investment. Both parties make money and you the 401K holder is left with significantly less money 40 years down the road.

I do think apple will be most affected by fx currency and that will be shown in the earnings.  I think international revenues will take a big hit and out of big tech is my least fav short term.  I own long term tho.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 13:29:35'] I think, there a lot of people invested in ETF, when market will going down, they wouldn't watch if they are invested in good/bad stocks, they will start selling, someones first, others could hold a little bit more, but when market collapse (as i expected) almost all will sell theirs etf, and the stocks more invested will drop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 16:57:15'] An easy answer from a traders idea. Traders knew this market was way to deep in profits. If you want to short the market SPY is ideal. If you really think SPY should be shorted you think what big ass company is going to lead the fall. Well Apple has run hard as mf. For myself when they are in big zone. When they were pushing 130 with stability I felt, this is the zone to DCA into. So overall, with stocks, options, crypto, I am easing in(aka DCA). I do still believe the real estate market hast had its full drop. But it would make a lot of sense for that being our capitulation(because the world gambled that the American housing market would not have fearful drawbacks after the 08/09 housing crisis.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/116k1kw/meta_announces_twitter_bluelike_paid_verification/'
POST_TEXT: b'Facebook parent Meta is rolling out a paid verification subscription service called Meta Verified for user profiles, co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said on February 19\n\nZuckerberg said the subscription service will let users verify their account with a government ID to receive a blue badge along with additional impersonation protection against accounts that are claiming to the user and get direct access to customer support.\n\nThe subscription service will be available for a fee of $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS. The higher subscription fee on iOS is likely to offset the 30 percent commission fee levied by Apple on subscriptions.\n\nMeta Verified will be initially rolling out to Australia and New Zealand this week with expansion to more countries shortly.\n\nThe social media giant\'s CEO Mark Zuckerberg has earlier said it was planning to launch several new products that would "empower creators to be way more productive and creative," while cautioning about the cost ass'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 12:10:22'] Imagine paying a company monthly to tell people that you are who you actually are rather than just providing government ID check for a small one-time fee.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 12:22:27'] Ugh. Gross.Oh well, I guess the badge will tell me who is foolish enough to pay for this
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 11:41:56'] Looks like the WSJ article where they got ahold of some documents from META was accurate.They are preparing for much lower revenues because of the shift to short form video and so even if Reels works out, they aren't going to make that much from advertising anymore. New forms of ads (click to message, lead generation, click to book, promo ads etc) are next up on the menu.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 16:39:29'] The day Reddit charges me a subscription fee, is the day I quit Reddit.It‚Äôs hilarious how Facebook sells your data, targets you with ads, and now wants to charge you a subscription fee on top of that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 11:26:52'] ID verification on its own might be a good idea.  Having people pay such a high fee is not.  What, am I gonna pay them while they‚Äôre selling all my data to third parties, which is now more valuable due to having the data of the verified government ID attached.  In fact now that I think about what they‚Äôve done with people‚Äôs data in the past, the idea of them knowing my street address (which would be on the ID I‚Äôd show them to get verified) seems like a really bad idea.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 13:50:10'] Looking at how bearish these comments are makes me more bullish on Meta. Inverse Reddit sentiment is real. Place feels more of a echo chamber of people claiming they ditched fb 10 years ago, yet fb continue to have more active users.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 21:56:53'] Its not for average joes but big corporations and influencers who rely on social media presence. If you are making thousands of dollars minimum per month through this app and want to make sure your not impersonated this makes way too much sense for the consumers than it did for twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 01:39:21'] Nice, looks like fucking ELON started a trend. Bringing Twitter blue in was the worst thing he could have done, now other social media companies will follow suit.

It‚Äôs like the majority of DLC‚Äôs for modern triple A games
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 03:24:51'] all the comments in here are acting like 1. everybody‚Äôs being forced to buy verification. If you don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt buy it?2. you‚Äôre the target audience with this move. you‚Äôre not.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 11:17:02'] I think, it is going to big failure. Elon Musk did because he wanted the current blue verified people/companies, who are mostly rich and have a lot money, to pay so other people don't steal their identity. He is like blackmailing them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 00:59:27'] I thought meta was a strong company at the current price due to its super strong foothold with Instagram, messenger and WhatsApp - all despite the metaverse But copying shitty ideas (and even trying to jump on the same argument of Apple eating 30%) from ADHDaddy is going to rip the face off Zuck. In contrast to Musk, there are 0 fanbois for the semi humanoid that will just relentlessly prop up the stock. Puts it is
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 01:03:23'] Nobody is going to pay money to that weirdo. This just prove that Meta is desperate. I'm thinking about going short.Nobody use Facebook anymore (heck even boomers are leaving), and if he does that to IG he'll just incentivize people to leave for TikTok and Youtube even more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 01:23:48'] Who cares?If you're an entity who makes money out of promoting your product on these platforms and you wanna make sure people know you're the official account, then paying is not a big deal.If you're someone who just seeks attention and want a verification badge for vanity, well, then don't pay and let it grow.So much bigger problems in life than this..

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 20:29:58'] This is essentially the yelp model of extortion.If I were a big company or a popular account owner, I would just let it pass and if Facebook mistakenly verifies another account as mine, sue them for damages as they clearly didn't do a proper verification.And for end users of Facebook, this is just bad marketing since it sends a signal that Facebook lost it completely.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 22:06:15'] Their advertising revenue is based on DAU‚Äôs - Daily Active Users. Since there are more fake accounts then real accounts, Meta has no incentive to clean up the platform and delete or filter out fake accounts. Doing so would cause advertisers to not spend and therefore Meta would fall apart. The grab to sell or charge for verified accounts is just a way of giving CPR to a dying platform.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 02:13:25'] I am not sure, but I feel like this should be illegal. They only verify your identity once, and from that point on you just keep paying even though they are doing nothing more to verify your identity. Like, if they wanted to charge you once for the service I would be ok with it. But if my account hasn't been compromised, how do you lose verification simply by not paying them monthly?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 12:59:00'] Be careful just looking at dividend yield. Extremely high ones tend to be because of problems. You might want to narrow down what you're looking for specifically in terms of yield.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 15:37:47'] Vanguard knows their stuff. Here are the top three holdings in their "High Dividend Yield" ([VHYAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vhyax)) index fund:1. Exxon Mobil2. Johnson & Johnson3. JPMorgan ChaseChoose reliable companies like these and commit for the long run. Set your dividends to automatically reinvest, and leave 'em alone.

For higher yeilds, I like midstream $ET which is returning close to 9% of capital each year.  Keep in in a taxable account, you don't pay taxes until you sell, you have to enter a K1 each year.  It can be subjected to a special tax in a tax advantaged account.For a REIT, I like $VICI.  They provide funding for local casinos, should be pretty recession proof and a nice return.  Put it in a tax advantage account.&#x200B;This is for entertainment only, I am not an advisor.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple ([AAPL.US](https://AAPL.US)) has told some of its contract manufacturers that it wants to increase production outside of China. India and Vietnam, already home to a small portion of Apple\'s global production, are also on Apple\'s shortlist to replace China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore than 90% of Apple products are manufactured in China by external contractors, such as iPhone, iPad, MacBook, etc. Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about Apple\'s supply chain and said: "Our supply chain is really global, so products are everywhere, and we will continue to think about optimizing the supply chain."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple announced in April this year that it would start producing the latest iPhone 13 series at Hon Hais Chennai factory in India. Under this production plan, all of Apple\'s best-selling models are now produced in India through Hon Hai and Wistron.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:40:46'] One of silver-linings of this massive supply chain bottleneck is that companies are just now realizing the huge costs of 'eggs in 1 basket'.I think the next few years will see mega-companies prioritizing logistics over the pennies saved per unit.

Tim Cook has briliantly navigated the China-US tarde wars and other conflicts and made sure Apple was never punished by either the US or China, nor ever used as a bargaining chip, but now Cook sees it being a lot safer to diversify production. Plus India is a huge market for Apple and like china has a massive supply of cheap tech savvy workers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:48:25'] I bought too much as it went down sub $100, planning to trim as it climbed back up. I‚Äôm sold about 15% of my stake in the last week, and probably have another 15-20% to go. But as far as the company, I‚Äôll be holding for a very long time. I‚Äôd estimate at least 5+ years, probably 10+
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:54:18'] I picked it up close to the lows when it was trading just above 10 PE. I recently sold 1/3 of my original position. Its currently selling pricy imo, but I just plan on holding .

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:50:31'] I'd average down and continue holding if I was planning to go long term on it when I bought it at 217.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 11:24:03'] Hold until earnings, then decide from there. Yes META has rose quite a bit, but it has better financial reasons for rising, unlike say.. Nvidia, which is more on speculation. The only reason I would potentially think about selling before earnings is if you don't believe Zuckerberg when he says his focus is on efficiency.I don't own META but I do believe he's correct and understands the market well, which is always a good thing for the stock price. I also think META can continue to cut jobs if need be, without hurting their main business model due to the nature of the business, which is extremely bullish. META is in the perfect spot to ride out this economic downturn. You rode out the downturn. You rode out the most bearish times. Don't sell now. If you're truly afraid of being locked into META in case of a downturn, but don't want to miss out on profits, just sell a portion of it. Especially if it's a high percentage of your portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 11:58:33'] I bought some after it hit bottom and started rising back up. I don't need to do too much research into the company to know the severity of the drop was unwarranted. It was dropping like it was going out of business. A company with half the planet as its userbase is not going out of business. They will be fine and continue to find more ways to monetize the planet and continue printing money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 12:59:36'] N
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 13:37:38'] Big tech, imo, is going to see a good ride for the next year. All these cuts are going to mean bank for the Q reports. That said, I am a bit hesitant on META right now. Could be that I sold after the last financial release and don't want to chase, but I also feel like they are the safe-tech darling at this very moment and Zuck seems like a relative 'good guy' in a world with Elon and TikTok. Not saying he is, just that is how many are showing him right now.I am a bit heavy in tech at the moment. Apple, Amazon, Pinterest, SEMRush. Been thinking about more Amazon. Keeping an eye on Airbnb and Facebook.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 14:23:53'] In a similar position to you, bought at around this level after the first big drop, doubled down at 100 or so, solidly up now. I started trimming today, I like the new lean meta a lot, they have a lot of revenue that it is very easy for them to turn into profit by sacking people, but it‚Äôs certainly less of a screaming buy than it was so I‚Äôll go back to normal position size now gradually (about 2% of port)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:27:35'] For sure, I am buying still.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 18:57:39'] Negative. In fact, sold it two weeks ago. The 6 month parties near an end. The fact your having this thought now, along with everyone else on Reddit, should tell you everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:13:13'] No, fuck the Zuck, and not in the good way, like you want.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 06:38:31'] i bought when it went under 100 and sold my entire (but small position) recently. I‚Äôm not a fan of the company but I had to bite when I saw how cheap they were for a company that literally prints money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 11:49:45'] I would use the jump to trim down at least diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 13:30:19'] Personally I think META is a shitty company because Zuck has too much control. If Zuck ever cashed out and left for good I might reconsider my opinion
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 13:46:42'] If you want tech buy Microsoft, they're the king for a reason.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 17:59:13'] What percent of their revenue is metaverse or AI? It may not even be significant enough to take into consideration when evaluating if you should hold the stock. Look at their owner's earnings (FCF) and calculate their value using the discounted cashflow formula (DCF). That's the only way to value any business.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:12:57'] I never buy and hold trendy stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 06:21:24'] If I did own any of the tech stocks it would be Microsoft and/or Apple, don‚Äôt really see any reason to own Meta at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 12:57:26'] I wouldn't, my fb is an empty shell (nobody posts anymore) and people aren't exactly hard for VR yet, probably because it doesn't have pp touchy mode built in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:41:31'] Nope I wouldn‚Äôt. Employee morale for them is going down and no one cares about the Metaverse anymore. AI/chatGPT is the new tech trend
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:56:27'] I‚Äôm in the exact same boat ‚Äî my average price is $216.39, so I‚Äôm also close to breaking even. If/when I get into the green on it, I‚Äôm thinking about selling and reinvesting into $VUG in order to diversify

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-18 13:37:58'] Almost every publicly traded tech company is either slowing hiring or letting go single digit percentage of employees. Most tech companies hoping to IPO have basically scrapped that plan and went back to a holding pattern.Most tech companies that do not currently have a profitable business and are still hunting for VC funding are in a world of pain right now.

Just two incredible companies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 20:29:22'] I think at 18, that's the perfect amount to have sitting in a savings account as an emergency fund.  What happens if your car fucks up tomorrow morning?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:39:14'] Personally for young people with very long term horizons (multi decade), a S&P or broad based market index is better. Apple might be a quality executing company today, but it might not be in 15 years. If you switch, you‚Äôll have to realize gains. With a broad index, just keep it in there until you really need it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:10:42'] Yes. Unequivocally at your age putting your money in an apple and hold for years is smart
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 23:17:13'] Only invest money you can miss for the long term.Sounds likely that you are going to need that 1k in the short term.Plus don't put everything in one stock. You should first learn about investing before you haphazardly jump in, that is a recipe for disaster. Some simple steps:1 is to learn the ropes/basics. What can I buy, where can I buy it, what can I reasonably expect in gains and costs, what are the risks etc. You are probably at this step.2 make a plan. What are your goals and how are you going to attain them. Don't deviate from this plan ever. It helps you to regulate your emotions. Especially in a crash.3 is to pay off all high interest debt and have an emergency fund in place.4 is to invest money that you can miss for the long termGood luck
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 20:27:04'] Depends on what you are saving it for. Either way aapl obviously is the most solid business out there, i wouldn't worry much unless you might need the money within couple of years. Because we are still in a rocky ride. So no one knows. If your time horizon is at least 5 years, Its solid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:57:45'] Maybe start averaging in about 20 to 50 a week ? Great to start getting your investment career going , but you also don‚Äôt want to get into the habit of dipping  into your brokerage account too in case of emergency . You got time , just start slowly stacking it up until you got a solid emergency fund rocking
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 05:09:29'] When I was in my early 20‚Äôs my brother gifted me 2 shares of apple in physical form because I loved the company. He spent about $50 a share I want to say. Have to go back and lookup the cost in 1999. I still have those 2 shares. They are now 112 shares after splits. They are now worth over 18kI then started investing and bought 250 shares. If I had kept them, after all the splits they‚Äôd be over 8800 shares and valued over 1.4 million. Long story short: yes. Buy and hold apple. If your looking for fast growth, then that‚Äôs not it. But they print money and they deliver dividends. I have and hold apple still.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:23:35'] Yes, I wish I was as smart as you when I was 18
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 02:13:54'] 1. Make sure to pay all debt especially credit cards 2. Do you have enough saving money for emergencies etc.3. Do you have a Roth IRA or a 401(k) for retirement or your country equivalent if you want it long term.4 aapl is a wel run company so you‚Äôd probably won‚Äôt lose much
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 04:43:58'] yes and DCA as often as possible, until your balls have grey hairs on them, then sell and buy your grandkids some ice-cream. then give them your millions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:52:02'] Don‚Äôt bother. You‚Äôll need the cash. Do you have 6-12 months of expenses saved up?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:29:15'] Wouldn‚Äôt put it all on apple. International events could happen that threaten apple in the long run:  China could declare war on taiwan effectively shutting the supply chain down, 3rd party suppliers for apple could go on strike due to wage issues, and so on. Realistically if you spread out your investment in apple over time, it could be a better play
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:07:56'] If stocks were as accessible when I was 18 as they are now, I would have done that

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 01:57:57'] Probably not a bad idea. A much better idea would be to buy some S&P TR ETF
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 02:40:14'] S&P500
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 04:26:44'] You may not want to have it in your savings account, but it would honestly be a very good idea. You want an emergency fund that's not invested. You don't want to be in a situation where something happens and you're forced to sell when your shares are down bad. One of the first things I recommend beginners is to set away an emergency fund before starting. And, you know, Apple is a good and quite stable company. But it's not protected from going down 10%+. And if you're forced to sell at that point that's 100 bucks down the drain.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 06:41:13'] Hold it in many different things and do your research, diversify your portfolio to minimise risk and make sure the biggest percentage is a well known ETF like s&p 500
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 08:30:45'] Do you're own research bro. I'm 18 and currently I hold a lot of blink charging because I believe they will be the leaders in Electrical Vehicle charging for years to come.I own GMC for their Total EV push by 2035 and own Ford because well I own a Ford Ranger and I'm from Detroit. I hold a few others like Raytheon and AMD but just do your research my guy.Take the time, read the articles, make the judgments yourself. All people on here can do is offer advice and so far I'm in green when it appears everyone else is in red. Just take your time and be patient as well. Don't see a downturn and panic sell. There's good days and bad, same with weeks and months.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 20:27:25'] Yes, it'll grow way more than the 0.01% interest your bank will give you have. They also pay a small dividend :).  An s&p500 etf would also be a smart play, safe and you get part of apple there too without the risk of a single stock
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:28:06'] MSFT is a much better long term hold. They are a more durable business, that is much more diversified than Apple. They‚Äôre less susceptible to consumer spending variance (they‚Äôre enterprise heavy), and they also have a higher dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:43:09'] Apple is a great long term buy but you need to be prepared for the real possibility you lose money on the trade pretty quick and watch your money disappear. It doesn't matter if you plan to hold because it'll go back up, it's just a bit hard on the heart the first time you see that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:49:16'] No save it for emergency
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:09:30'] When you put your money in a savings account, the bank invests that money themselves and gives you chump change. Apple is perhaps the safest company out there with strong growth. Can't go wrong with it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:51:19'] No. Don't put all your saving in stocks, even as stable as apple is it is still vulnerable to geopolitics. At your age, you should invest in yourself: learn skills, make connections, make memories...
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:09:51'] Good plan. I think they pay out dividends too. You might get lucky and benefit from some stock splits. There are some rumors of an EV venture too from Apple
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 21:33:57'] Nope. Buy into equities that pay high dividends. Apple pays almost nothing. You're young. You can afford higher risk for more return. Share price can deflate overnight, but cash is cash.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:05:09'] You want to have zero money in your bank? $1000 in cash is not that much that I would be worried about inflation. What if you need the money and you put it in apple and then it drops?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:24:46'] Slowly start buying into index funds. Definitely do your own research, and this is not financial advice, but I invest a modest amount each week straight from my checking account. The new apps make it possible to buy fractional shares. A lot of people like funds like VTI, SPY, VOO, IVV. The markets are turbulent right now and it‚Äôs wise to keep some money in an emergency fund. You have a long time to build wealth, start slow and cautiously and observe the market until you get a good sense of things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 23:54:36'] Sure, why not.  Apple is kind of beaten down at the moment, but it doubled in 2020.  Just make sure you diversify and put the next $1,000 in a different stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 02:51:24'] Buy voo
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 04:02:38'] Worst case scenrio your 1000 will turn into 900... i dont think apple will drop more then that...
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 05:17:03'] That 1000 is better placed in a savings account as a liquid emergency fund rather than in a stock (where you also have to file taxes on when you sell it)Savings and investments are separate things. Don‚Äôt treat both as the same as both have different  goals
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 05:27:22'] As long as you have backup in the bank--$1000 is a good start.  Don't invest any of that, as it's your emergency/moving/vacation/surprise fund. It is a great idea to put your *next* $150 or so into Apple (or any good index, or any major stock) to let it grow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 05:56:22'] $1000 is a great amount to start with but, it all depends on your current situation are you planning to move out for college if not then will your parents still pay for the majority of your expenses or do they expect you to work and contribute a little.If you don't have any of that issues then go ahead if you have a very long horizon apple won't ever disappoint.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 06:15:16'] The core of your portfolio should be VTI.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 07:29:44'] Apple, Amazon, Microsoft. Those companies are all great to have stocks in long-term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 08:16:52'] I think split that with google for diversification reason.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 08:37:09'] Put it in stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 09:00:55'] Stocks and savings are very different things, as others have hinted at, if that $1000 is your only "emergency" money then no it's not smart... I'd always suggest having an amount of emergency money in an easy access account is smart, after that have money that can sit in stocks or other investments...
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 09:06:34'] Yea it's a great idea to invest your savings. A good stock will not keep going down. You only lose money when you sell at a loss, just wait for it to go up. If you don't need the money, invest it. Pick a no commission (free buy and sell) platform like Robinhood or WealthSimple. I invest in google, amazon and tesla, so I don't know too much about apple
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 10:13:18'] $1000 is a bare minimum of what I would say is emergency. I would say going forward, start DCAing into stocks, but look for ones that you think have massive upside potential. Apple falls into the category of ‚Äú Oh no, Pelosi made a trip to Taiwan and now China is curtailing Apples production in China‚Äù risk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 10:25:09'] Apple is a great long term investment and a good way to start buying stock.As for the people that say keep the cash at Apples lowest point in the last 6 months that 1k would have been worth 800 bucks. So while losing money sucks if needed you could still pull that money out.However,short term be mentally prepared to lose money. It's unclear if the stock market is on its way to recovery, or could drop again in the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 10:43:29'] If you like to read annual reports (some people do) you could use a dcf model as a guideline for getting a rough idea about the value of ur investmentThis is especially a good habit if you‚Äôre young and have a lot of time to just holdPeople tend to forget that investments involve risk return and most importantly of all, time. You have 1000 usd in cash but you have a fortune in terms of time. No reason to invest with the hopes that market will favor you. Invest in a firm that will continue generating money for you (apple is prolly a good bet here)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 11:13:06'] That amount of money is of no consequence.  That being said you're 18. You don't "need" to be investing in the stock market that early. Maybe take that $1000 and put it towards education or travel.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 11:24:42'] I think the better question is what are you doing to keep making money to invest with. If Apple is worthless in 5 years it won't matter if you've made $100,000 since then. Everyone here will tell you that your doing better than most 18 year Olds by investing in general. Let alone having 1k to put into something. Financial intelligence is worth a lot more than 1k of any stock in the long run

POST_TEXT: b"# Is the volatile streaming media stock finally worth buying?\n\n\r  \nNetflix (NFLX 5.54%) has taken investors on a wild ride over the past two years. The streaming media giant's shares surged during the buying frenzy in growth stocks and closed at an all-time high of $691.69 on Nov. 17, 2021.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Netflix's stock plummeted to a multiyear low of $164.28 on June 14, 2022, as its growth decelerated, it lost subscribers for the first time in over a decade, and rising interest rates deflated its valuations. But after sinking to that nadir, Netflix's stock more than doubled to about $380 over the past year.\r  \n\r  \nIs it finally safe to buy Netflix's stock after those massive price swings? Let's see four reasons to buy Netflix and one reason to sell it -- to see whether it's still a good investment.\n\n# 1.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 10:17:08'] Is it a brokered CD? If so, then generally you'll get whatever the market price is plus accrued interest. Since it's a 3 month, I doubt it will move too much, but it's possible in this environment. There is a chance though that the market value plus accrued interest is less than what you put in. So be mindful of that. If you are just waiting for an opportunity, I'd keep it in a high yield money market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 17:20:55'] As someone that bought a Tesla Model X in 2017, largely because of that video, where do I join the lawsuit? If this is true, it was a campaign that was deliberately misleading for consumers like myself. When I bought the car, was told by Tesla employees, backed by Musk‚Äôs public statements, that this self-driving technology was imminent. The video was their main sales pitch. It‚Äôs now 2023, I still have the car, it‚Äôs in the self driving ‚ÄúBeta,‚Äù and it is laughably incapable of managing mundane driving complications. I feel foolish, but it also appears I was deliberately misled. Carmakers shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to deliberately misled consumers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 06:59:22'] Elon has said multiple times that their self driving tech is what makes them special, and is what makes Tesla so valuable. More valuable than all the other auto manufacturers in the world, including the ones that sell more cars and make more profit. We've reached the point where those competitors have matched or passed their tech. Mercedes is the first to sell a car internationally certified for level 3 self driving and is building a billion dollar EV charging network. Even Subaru has matched Tesla at Level 2 with their EyeSight system, already in use in over a million cars. Basically every major manufacturer has promised to deliver Level 3 or higher in the next few years.With Tesla following instead of leading at this point, and missing deadlines by years being commonplace, I really do think their perceived value will start to drop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 15:33:33'] Tesla deserves this. I can't believe how stupid and irresponsible their marketing team was. When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being "self-driving" or having an "autopilot" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) "autopilot" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is "operating on autopilot" means that they're distracted).Even if the engineers had wanted to call it an "autopilot" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-14 13:50:22'] Based on the conversation here, a thought about timing the market:If the time before you will need the money is counted in years, then it is possible to time the market with a degree of success. If, by historical measures, the market is undervalued by a standard deviation or more, you own stocks and you keep holding until such time as the market approaches being over-valued by a standard deviation, at which point you start to trim. The higher the market goes from there, the more you trim, and as the market approaches being over-valued by two standard deviations, you get out.I'm being specific to make my example concrete. The principle is that if stocks begin to look more like speculation than investment, you get out.In a world of black swans, this plan can fail you, but this is at least a version of timing the market that makes use of the notion that over a time scale of years, it is possible to assess whether the market is \*likely\* to return more than alternative holdings.Two things can screw this up badly. One is that you are investing in a very small number of individual companies. The risk of a surprising event, in either direction, is considerable for an individual company. The fewer your holdings, the more potential there is for the company to be subject to something wonderful or awful.The other thing that can screw it up is normal, short-term volatility. In the short term, the market is driven more by emotion than reason. If you're talking about a handful of trading days, emotion can trump reason significantly. If a market drops 20% over six months, that likely reflects a change in conditions. But the daily swings up and down on the way there will be many multiples of 20% and will be the result of how market participants are feeling about the market on that particular day.Technical analysis aims to capture those changes in sentiment, and technical analysis can be successful if it's predictive for slightly better than half the time. Technical analysis will thus be wrong \*close to\* half the time at least, and the shorter the time frame, the worse it will perform.So the shorter the time frame and the smaller the number of stock issues being considered, the less there is to reliably say about where the price may go next. To hold on to shares with money that you're going to need in less than a year is speculating, not investing.Anyone can get surprised by an unexpected need for cash, but that's also something to consider before buying shares.

Oil and gas, fertilizer stocks, mining, and other asset heavy stocks are in the tubes. I am still losing a bunch of money on the ones I bought recently, but companies like $XOM, $CVE, $NTR, $MOS, and $VALE, aren't going out of business. They may not have the highest growth potential though. I would recommend having a few defensive stocks, just as a hedge.

POST_TEXT: b'It seems that Visa/Mastercard has never had a bad year, and looking at the current market they seemingly have little to no competitors. Everyone uses their system to make payments, and investing in their shares gives better returns than most of the popular ETFs. What are you guys opinion regarding these 2? Would you consider them the heavyweights in the next 10-20 years?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 09:20:14'] and for the legitimate reasons you have stated, their valuations aren't low (30+ P/E). i would say that continued duopolisation is baked into their current valuations, but there's multiple reasons that duopoly could be disrupted (government regulation, fintech options, amex outperforms for whatever reason) I wouldn't be opposed to a 5-10% stake in these, though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:02:11'] Two very strong companies with wide moat. One thing to be cautious of is government regulation. There were a couple moments last year some lawmakers had V and MA in their crosshairs but that chatter seems to have died down now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:06:04'] I go back and forth on this. In some ways the need for V and MA today seems redundant as these companies effectively just act as middlemen taxing consumer purchases. Both were useful for enabling digital transactions in a world before the internet and prior to the invention of digital currencies, but today all they do is extract value from economic activity while yielding monopolistic power over our transactions.In the coming years I wouldn't be surprised to see a continued push for tech that disrupts and works around the need for traditional payment processors. I also think you'll see some countries adopting digital currencies which will allow consumers and businesses to transfer funds to each other directly without the need for middlemen.Then again, given their size and influence it seems unlikely that this would happen in the West. I see them both as having solid moats as of right now, but I also don't understand the value these companies deliver to the consumer which makes me nervous to invest. I don't think anyone uses V or MA because they want to, we use these companies because we're forced to. As an investor that's great if you're happy to assume in the future consumers will continue to have no other options, but should that change it's not like anyone has any loyalty or love for their payment processor.Personally for a long-term hold I'd rather stick with a company like KO which has some loyalty and isn't at risk of technological disruption.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:10:52'] V and MA are 98% heavyweights for the next 10-20 years. Very large moat, and only thing that is disrupting them is speculative ideas that more than likely will not come into fruition.

PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions.

These bonds hold an unrealized loss.- They are using a 5 year CAGR metric but if you compare the current financials with 2022, you can see that the growth is slowing quite rapidly.- they have no moat. They are using an network that is built by others. - strong competition.- many Users don't hold a balance on their account because they are scared that PayPal blocks them without a reason. See paypal sub - less customer funds means less investment possibilities.- high interest rate - slowing ecnomy - less transactions.- They also bought a lot of shares during the covid bull run -

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 08:54:07'] Great analysis of PayPal.  I enjoyed reading it.  One area I was interested in hearing is reserves for acquisitions.  With the little companies, are there any profit-making smaller companies that would be a good fit?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 04:53:03'] The market is pricing in competition that keeps improving while Paypal's own quality of service declines. I however agree that it has enough installed userbase and inertia to payback shareholders through repurchases alone, in the next 5 years. After that, the opportunity for profit gets more clouded. Mainly due to competition like Venmo, Zelle, and Apple Pay.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 23:39:59'] Apple does nice things slowly in a very closed and controlled environment. General search is not one of those things you can do in such a manner.

Do your own bet and good luck.My take: I'm long both on Google and Apple. For me the news would be bullish on Google (they will save cash) and neutral on Apple (they now have to either continuing offering the same service without the gains from Google or look for another provider that will likely provide a worse service).Perhaps they decide to invest on their own solution instead (Apple search). What happens then? some people will be bullish with the idea. However, I think I will turn bearish since I don't think Apple can release any good service outside of its own walled garden (and for a search engine you need to go outside)

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 06:26:13'] In my opinion, nothing, Google has a lock on being the most popular and widely used search engine. We've turned it into a verb, Googling, Google it. Do you hear people saying Bing it, or Yahoo it? That being said, I believe the user should have the option of setting their preferred Search Engine, and Browser. I also feel they should have the option (more so on PC and Android) to install a Vanilla OS with no extra 3rd party crap, and at and the end of that setup, the choice to try the 3rd party apps normally bundled and the ability to fully remove them once the user realizes their worthless.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 06:33:24'] Have you tried any other search engine? They suck. Google could spend the 15B on ad campaign to teach apple users how to change the browser themselves to chrome.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 06:42:53'] In 2020, globally Android was on 74.4% of all phones.   That number is expected to go up to 87% in 2023.   In 2021, Apple shipped 14% of all phones.  99% of everything else is running Android. MacOS has about a 9.5% market share, down from 14.8% in 2018.Apple might go ahead and make their own search engine, but it can only default it on so many devices, and they have to sell ads on it, which won't reach as many people as ads bought on Google. Because MacOS and iOS isn't as prevalent, people making software will want to build for Android or Windows first, and then maybe if they have extra resources port it to Apple stuff.      Windows won the desktop market by being installed on all sorts of other's hardware, like Android, and for having the larger installed base, it became a more useful product by having more software developed for it.       Apple is once again shooting itself in the foot with iOS, like it did with MacOS.    This might be a temporary setback to Google, but their model for making Android the most prevelant was previously proven by Microsoft with Windows and is working for them now.  Google built in an advantage for their search engine by practically giving away Android to whoever will sell it on their phones.

It is clear that the 27% of iOS is still significant, but most people will still change whatever is the default search engine to Google.To give you an example, Windows owns 88% of the market share, and 30% use Bing because they are too lazy to change the default search engine

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/apple-to-let-iphones-accept-credit-cards-without-extra-hardware\n\nApple Inc. is planning a new service that will let small businesses accept payments directly on their iPhones without any extra hardware, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe company has been working on the new feature since around 2020, when it paid about $100 million for a Canadian startup called Mobeewave that developed technology for smartphones to accept payments with the tap of a credit card. The system will likely use the iPhones near field communications, or NFC, chip that is currently used for Apple Pay.\n\nn order to accept payments on an iPhone today, merchants need to use payment terminals that plug in or communicate with the phone via Bluetooth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 05:24:40'] There goes my SQ farther down‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 08:20:55'] Apple has around 2 billion devices in peoples hands. Think about that. Services and payments are just getting started for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 05:40:34'] I actually commercially trialled this exact feature on Android smart phones about five years ago now. It's trivial to do this with encryption and NFC. I was working for a big payments company at the time. Our conclusion was that because it's NFC only, and because you are using someone else's phone screen to input data (so entering your PIN is impossible) that it's not viable for any transactions over the NFC limit which at the time was $100.So yeah, it's cool for maybe taking a transaction when you sell your ebay item or selling your potatoes at the market or your friend wants to pay their split of lunch, but it's not going to make anyone rich. The margins are so tiny on credit card transactions and this product is limited to very small transactions so at the end of the day it's basically a gimmick.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 08:26:33'] I don't think this will bite into Square's market share as much as people may think.Business owners have so many other variables to consider besides "what's the cheapest way for me to take card payments‚Äù. Square has already offered free phone readers for years, so it's not like there's been a high barrier to entry. Plus there's a reason why most businesses elect for the more traditional payment terminals or registers (security, professionalism, etc). This will only affect the tiny businesses selling at the farmers market or a mall stand (who already likely have a free square reader and would need to switch).This isn‚Äôt even accounting for the entire Square ecosystem of business features that no one else can offer (and is their main selling point).

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 18:32:36'] I used Square for my coffee shop for a few years. The terminals they came out with were great and the fees were ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù compared to others. The back end inventory management and reports were very helpful. Using the iPad before was a real pain in the ass with constant updates and other nonsense issues. It‚Äôs not a business I could run with an iPhone, as people still use cash and I needed an actual drawer. The market is already saturated with merchants services and it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to change everything over, even for a small shop. Might be fine for a single self employed individual.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 08:27:46'] I've posted on some other comments here, but just want to say that Apple's entry into the electronics payments on the seller-side does not mean it's automatically going to dominate and put Square and other fintechs out of business. First, while SQ's original business was the credit card payment terminal that you could attach to your phone, it's grown far beyond that over the years. SQ doesn't just provide a payment terminal for small businesses, it provides services that are needed for running and growing the business: keeping track of inventory, payroll, insurance, taxes, reward programs, and even loans. So if I am a small business owner relying on SQ's services, I'm not going to start using Apple's payment terminal and abandon SQ unless they provide something equivalent in terms of business services at a similar cost. I'm not familiar with what Apple plans to do besides what's written in the above article, but I don't think they've set the groundwork to provide such services.Second, SQ's business has also grown beyond the seller-side with the Cash App digital wallet becoming a multi-billion dollar business. Not going to go into detail about that here, but I think it's important to remember how diverse SQ's business has become in about a decade. Obviously there's competition and risk, that's true with investing in any company, but I do think that SQ will be a long term winner in the fintech space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 09:49:04'] Apple is quickly becoming the jack of all trades, master of none. Steve Jobs was concerned about focus and innovation, He always took dives into the unknown, Cook is more about squeezing more revenue from any outlet it can from its iPhone oligopoly to appease shareholders. Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music Subscriptions, iCloud, Apple Credit Cards. These are all things that was suppose to disrupt their industries because "It's Apple" but if anything its made tiny dents in those industries and to be honest I think that is all Cook is looking for, more revenue stream. Square has more things to worry about than just Apple like other startup competitors who want to build ecosystems on par with Squares or the 'head in the clouds' CEO, which unlike jobs who had his head in the clouds as well, just doesn't have the same focus and intuition as Jobs did in the second half of his career.

Now, I have the square app and card reader, which is great because it deducts their fee first and then transfers the funds into your account. The downside, I feel are the fees. I mean, it's bad enough I have to pay taxes quarterly let alone having to pay someone to use their services at high rates.

However, it‚Äôs risky to keep 100% of your portfolio in retail tech. Any slow down in either can lead to a broader crash in his portfolio and loss of capital. Just my two cents, investing also comes down to personal preference
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:19:28'] A huge portion apple's phone sales and mobile gaming revenue comes from china so I'd at least keep a close eye on the news to see if politics will end up being a problem. Otherwise they still have plenty of growth left in India and sea regions so they can still rely on their phones for a decent amount of time before they have to do something new. &#x200B;amazon at least in the short term is harder to justify because of how slow aws is growing combined with their ecommerce segment being hit hard by supply chain issues and generally already being barely profitable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:32:39'] Anything can happen (Enron) however, for the next decade these companies are probably ok and I wouldn't be surprise if they beat the market by a significant margin.One would need to be up to date on all news, It wouldn't be a portfolio where you can just forget about it and never check it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:32:47'] I like his strategy. A ‚Äúsafe-risk‚Äù is how I like to think about it. Short term upside might be there and if that fails then long term you are safe with the stocks as long as you didn‚Äôt chase ATH and DCA if we see the stocks keep creeping down. I‚Äôm all AMZN and TLRY atm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:35:44'] It depends; Apple will probably be around for the next while due to having a pretty dedicated market and being in near-complete control (at least now) of their side of the market. Amazon provides a pretty good service in buying and fulfilment (they own the "last mile" from warehouse to customer house, whereas Wal-Mart and Target still rely on UPS/USPS for even basic things like a phone charger). There is competition in those areas, but it's still a few years off from encapsulating what both companies can do.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:25:45'] It's a bit of risk for sure, but not insanely risky imo. These are both good companies trading at fairly reasonable valuations and both are extremely unlikely to go to zero. The risks start mounting when one or more of those things are not true.He'll likely see more volatility holding just two stocks, but he'll also have a much higher upside potential. I mean if he's been holding these two for the last decade your brother is looking pretty smart right now...What might be sensible is to take 10k out and put it in an all-world fund, but I guess that depends on risk tolerance. I'm not a huge fan of diversifying for the sake of diversifying. If he's happy with the risk/reward of this portfolio then it's a good portfolio for him regardless of what the index funder holders here will tell you.

Plus, I mean... depending on how much he has of each, I would not be shocked if he had 80k just a short time ago, which is a much bigger drop than the market at large.I am overweight on Apple probably, but I mean like a bit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 16:08:24'] I'm gonna go against the grain here and say I think tech is just on a down cycle and it has not reached its highs yet.Internet usage is still increasing is the USA and, of course, even more worldwide. The internet is also a much bigger part of younger generations' lives compared to older generations who have more of the money.AI, augmented reality/VR, and self-driving all seem to be lead by big tech companies.If you look at most of their earnings in constant currency, the numbers look much better. Also, many of them over-hired and they may be able to sort out that issue.Most of them are still the same companies that have negligible debt and gobs of cash on the balance sheet.

Maybe even the next 10.AI and gene editing are the two next-big-leaps for technology but I don't think either particular tech is going to mature enough to be profitable in the short or medium term.

Apple is more of a lifestyle company now, Amazon the biggest online retail, Google search ads, etc. I mean Netflix is a media company more than anything else. They have very little in common and yet dominate their space. I can see some slow down but they all have mountains of cash and generating ridiculous amount of cash flow. I know everyone thinks growth is going to slow but I don‚Äôt see it. They will buy up all the failing companies in the next 5-10 years and just keep getting bigger and into new revenue streams. Who‚Äôs going to stop them? Oil and banks?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 17:47:14'] I agree with you entirely. The fact we all believe there‚Äôs infinite growth for these monopolized companies is hilarious. This growth trajectory is not sustainable, and when they don‚Äôt sustain growth, the stock prices will drop and eventually, in my opinion there will be a massive, MASSIVE hit to the global economy and small fry investors are gonna get smoked first. We all rely on the stock market as supplemental income potential, yet fail to see its flaws or the impact on the wealth gap.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:55:59'] It's good that they're evolving - you don't want to be always doing the same thing and getting steamrolled by an upstart.  \- MSFT disrupting Google is the first time anyone has successfully scared Google. This is great news.\- Google has been moving into cloud and eating Amazon's lunch for almost a decade now.

I lean bullish on AMZN since their shipping has better margins and AWS is a beast despite the slowdown. FB was really undervalued for a while and with more temperate expectations, it could produce good returns. AAPL is a very mature company and growth won‚Äôt be too crazy until it comes up with a new thing. But it‚Äôs also a safety stock that traders depend on. The big question mark for me right now is GOOGL. They got complacent and have poor leadership. I think the next FAANG will be in growth stocks like MELI, TTD, NET, and I think NVDA has a lot of room to run.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 09:10:15'] I would imagine with AI being in the limelight there isn't a wall **right now**. But my track record with tech stocks hasn't been super so maybe don't consider my statement.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 10:13:18'] The past few years especially these companies haven't been innovating as much and instead have begun building moats and acquiring/using already existing technology (such as cloud). Larger companies (especially $500 billion+ market cap) are usually much more careful about trying out new ideas because there is now a lot more at risk (even tech companies). They stick to what they know works and generates cash-flow. The only real innovation these companies get now-a-days is from acquiring startups or otherwise investing in other companies with a proven concept or promising future. This is one of the reasons Apple constantly sits on tons of cash.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 10:39:01'] I'd argue that competition has always been there. Windows tried to go toe to toe with Android, Google + tried to challenge Facebook. Everyone has been trying to get a slice of AWS's lunch for years now. Some of these markets are still growing so there is room for co-existencd. To beat the incumbent you need a big edge. I don't think the bing bot is it (chatGPT as a standalone app would be better). I mean it's still Bing, inferior to Google search in most people's eyes and it's likely Google will do a better job implementing Bard as Microsoft tech is not as clean. Just my opinion.TikTok is a real risk to YouTube and Instagram. But it won't be fatal. And certain folk will happily pay whatever apple feel like charging to be part of the walled garden
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:36:52'] I haven‚Äôt seen many mention US/China decoupling as an issue for big tech.

Healthcare is ripe for innovation and people like Amazon are doubling down on it. Genetics stemming from CRISPR on the threshold of insanity. META drops or slows its pipe dreams of the METAVERSE and the bottom line just kills it. EV still has a long ways to go. I mean, it is going to be different this decade over last decade, but it always is.

POST_TEXT: b'I recently [wrote a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/139i09y/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_may_06_2023/jj96or7/) about the shareholder \'revolution\' that is starting to emerge in Japan. Japanese companies are notorious for sitting on mountains of cash; they don\'t do large buybacks or dividends that let shareholders invest elsewhere, nor do they invest in projects with ROI. Let me quote some snippets (recommend reading the whole comment):\n\n> What\'s odd about Japanese corporations is that despite [decent profitability](https://i.imgur.com/BotfhZu.png), albeit generally [lower than that of the S&P 500](https://i.imgur.com/B6PKElP.png), they don\'t reward shareholders with that profitability. As a consequence, "The average Topix company has a staggeringly high 50 per cent equity-to-assets ratio, according to JPMorgan."

Apparently, they just can't figure out what to do with that money. I'm antagonizing over the decision to buy more since they have a great P/E and really good dividends. I don't know what to do.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 00:44:58'] Roku has like $1.7b on a 7.5b market cap, about 23% of it's market cap. They had like $2b for all of 2021-2023 just sitting there not doing much with it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 22:23:54'] I only recently bought AAPL, starting at $135. My average is $150. Plan is to hold 20+ years through thick and thin. I would have loved to have bought in at $70! I think it has the potential to still go much higher. Apple isn‚Äôt going out of business anytime soon, and they are probably working on things we have not even imagined yet. If/when it ever gets to $1000, you might regret selling it. If it were me, I wouldn‚Äôt sell more than 10%. Maybe I‚Äôm too optimistic. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see the same exponential returns it has had in the past, but it‚Äôs still a top pick and worth holding, not for years, but for decades, depending on your age.

Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  \nApple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  \nYes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  \nStock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 17:41:13'] I kept buying the falling knife and it‚Äôs starting to look much better now. The amount of ppl calling me an idiot on here was ridiculous. I have a few friends in marketing at a Fortune 500 company and they said ads on FB/Insta are unmatched in their hit rate. They were expanding their ad budget this year and it was all going to FB. They made it sound like Tik Tok was still light years away - and they love using TikTok on their personal time lolThe only negative I‚Äôll say is I kept buying it so much, it became close to 15% of my entire portfolio. And I‚Äôm sure that was risky. But I just couldn‚Äôt believe how much it kept falling. I bought a bunch in the $90-$100 range and wish I got more. I needed this earnings lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 16:58:39'] I am not a shareholder of Meta so I am going to try to look at this quarter as objective as possible without looking at the stock in the after hours (which seems to be the focus of Reddit currently)Revenue: Not good2021: 33.7 billion2022: 32.2 billion (-4%)Income from Operations: Really not good2021: 12.6 billion2022: 6.4 billion (-49%)Operating Margins: Not good2021: 37%2022: 20% (-46%)Net Income: Really not good2021: 10.3 billion2022: 4.6 billion (-55%)Lets look at their business segments 1. Family of Apps:Revenue:2021: 32.8 billion2022: 31.4 billion (-4%)Net Income:2021: 15.9 billion2022: 10.7 billion (-33%)2. Reality Labs ( this is the one of they are supposed to be growing and are sinking a ton of money into)Revenue:2021: 877 million2022: 727 million (-17%)Net income:2021: -3.3 billion2022: -4.3 billion (-23%)The losses from their Reality segments has really accelerated and they currently spent around 9 billion dollars of Capex compared to last years quarter which was around 5.4 billion.Overall looking at the fundamentals its still pretty ugly. The balance sheet also got a bit uglier from their current assets taking a big dip due to the cash they‚Äôre burning on this Reality Labs investment. Both current liabilities and total liabilities took a sizable increase. The good news is that they can afford these hits due to the balance sheet being clean. The stock is still down over 50% from its highs even after this after hours jump. My guess is that either the stock has already so much bad news priced into it that people just really don‚Äôt care about these losses. Most likely its the 40 billion stock buyback that causing the stock to balloon after hours which is a buyback that will eliminate 10% of their total shares. There could have also been guidance that I did not see as I did not listen to the earnings call.Overall very ugly quarter from a fundamental standpoint. Not interested in the stock and especially not interested after the after hours move lol. Just going to continue to stay away and continue to let Zuckerberg bleed money on these ridiculous goggles that nobody is buying.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 14:12:34'] I thought that earnings sucked. But Zuck's theme about improved efficiency and reducing CapEx by $4B and overall expense by $7B or so is making Wall Street bullish on Meta. But that cash burn on Reality Labs is still crazy. Is it because they are selling hardware at a loss or R&D into future products. When that goes down, the stock will truly be back. Until then this is a temporary boost for bag holders to exit :-) I might exit my position if this sustains tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 03:49:37'] BTW about Meta/Facebook. Buybacks make sense when a company is cheap. It has to be 'significantly' cheap or all you're doing is effectively adding operational gearing to juice ROE measurements.So, anyway. Facebook's price just jumped 20%. That means the amount of stock they can buyback now, is what they could have bought for $32bn yesterday. But now they'll have to pay $40bn for it. Effectively, the 20% jump in price aftermarket has just cost shareholders $8bn worth of cash.A series of small buyback announcements would have been more rational and effective.But, they needed a big distraction from 20% drop in EPS. They got it. 20% jump in stock price, hi-5s all around, but that fuzzy warm share price glow for a day just cost shareholders $8 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 23:05:03'] This is why I don't like the comparisons of this correction to the dot com bubble.  If you extrapolate the earnings from the top companies during the dot era and add in inflation; they are nowhere near as strong as the top dogs today.  The dot com ear was insanely overpriced compared to now.  Back then QQQ p/e were in the 200s and the current QQQ p/e is something like \~30.Yes, there is some over valued tech companies and they have corrected.  However, the top dogs are for real with huge profits and earnings.  Apple is on pace for 500B revenue; that's the GDP of some middling countries!   What was Cisco doing in 2000?  15B on a valuation of 600B.

Kind of like buying Gucci or LV so instead of androids people want a apple product.  But when the USA raises rates and stops this free money for everybody effect, we will see the USA\`s true colors as well.&#x200B;Not preaching doom , just being real about whats going on. The smart money will still sell apple since a market cap over $2 trillion dollars is still ridiculous. to put that in context. The USA\`s GDP is only 21 trillion dollars. Its good that apple makes alot of money but when the USA fixes its free money for everybody policy, apple will fall under that 2 trillion market cap very soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 13:29:02'] Tesla is a great, innovative company that is doing important work, and doing it well.But declining gross margins (before even accounting for price cuts that came after the quarter ended, and before fully accounting for other price cuts that came in the middle of the quarter) and dramatically increasing inventory on hand are big enough red flags to keep me out of a long position, even after the big pullback.It‚Äôs still an auto manufacturer. Margin pressure is the biggest threat to the Tesla bull narrative. Tesla has big efficiencies and made timely investments that other competitors don‚Äôt have/didn‚Äôt make, so higher margins now aren‚Äôt pure vapor - there‚Äôs a reason for it. But I continue to think those have to trend toward industry norms in the long term, and the present valuation is too rich if that happens.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 14:43:51'] My feelings about Tesla - great innovator (of EVs), however in the long game(10+ years), SP will struggle to reach new highs. German and Japanese car makers have large enough moat to make competitive products. Europeans will always prefer euro cars, and will prefer a BMW made EV to Tesla, same as Asian will prefer a Toyota. Once the  factories of European car makers get setup for large volumes of EVs, there is no stopping. They will ultimately win the numbers game (cars sold), margins will probably be lower than Tesla though.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 12:48:57'] Alternative: Buy a semiconductor ETF (SMH? SOXX?), and buy AAPL individually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 13:57:17'] Looking for better growth potential? Go with AMD   Looking for a safer, less volatile option? Go with Apple   Looking for something in between these two? Go with NVIDIA   My personal preference is AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 15:04:55'] Intel for dividends. AMD maybe got the biggest chance at increasing revenue by robbing more corporate market shares off Intel in the short term. Anyway with a now steadier chip supply, start of the rise of arm chips for corporate servers, new chips factories coming up everywhere in the next two years.. I'd be very careful in investing in nvda or amd given their current p/e. They'll still make profits, the question mark is on how much. I see Apple as a safer bet because of its loyal customers and appeal as a "fashion" brand rather than just tech.

I'm quite interested in know how big of role their enterprise branch is. Anyone has insights to this? I mean, their quadro lineup is not exactly cheap and most servers requires more GPU than what a typical consumer grade computer would have. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure they have dwellings / collaborations specifically in the enterprise sectors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 08:40:38'] Like how you stated the 3 biggest bubbles if there was a crash
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 09:35:40'] As someone who‚Äôs been watching all 3 recently, here‚Äôs my take on what will happen.1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we‚Äôre gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I‚Äôm sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don‚Äôt think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they‚Äôd grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it‚Äôs actually pretty fairly priced where it‚Äôs at. 3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It‚Äôs about 60% off it‚Äôs ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it‚Äôs a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn‚Äôt been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi‚Äôs really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they‚Äôre undervalued, so they‚Äôre buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.Of these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.I think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They‚Äôve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn‚Äôt mean a 20% drop couldn‚Äôt happen over the next few months.Disclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 18:04:16'] NVDA has an increasing AI play that is pretty cool. Take a look into their current projects.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 19:46:24'] I am always surprised nobody mentions here that semiconductors are historically a very cyclical sector. If that still holds true, there will be an oversupply somewhere down the road, leading to crashing product prices -- which would wreak havoc on semiconductor stocks trading at high multiples.Maybe this time it's different. Or maybe reddit is blinded by confirmation and recency bias. I dunno, really.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 00:46:15'] I own NVDA and AAPL both. NVDA still has high price but since I keep selling covered call+put options my real cost down a lot. The same to AAPL, down the cost. If a person can only buy one stock that must be AAPL. How could one build his/her portfolio without the greatest company? AAPL has stable ecosystem of products, huge growth potential of service business which would increase gross margin.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 07:25:04'] I think AAPL is the most overvalued. Sure they're growing rapidly right now but their products are are expensive and discretionary, so if the economy slows they will suffer the most. Also heavy exposure to potential Taiwan conflicts. Everyone thinks AAPL is super safe, and that alone makes it unsafe.  AMD is the best price for its growth in my opinion. But it's at 40 p/e... you might get it at 30 p/e in the next 12 months. Still AMD has a lot of exposure to consumer PC markets. It's more discretionary than NVDA.  NVDA is just too expensive, in my opinion because of the metaverse hype, but we are seeing the valuations contract. Maybe you get it at 40 p/e soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 00:02:32'] I love all 3 so this is a great question. NVDA great verticals, sitting on a ton of cash, I can see them making a big move since ARM deal didn't go through, they will definitely buy something else. If they raise cash from creation of new shares (rumor currently) I believe this is confirmation that they will do something huge with the money. Sure they are trading at a high multiple but winners are expensive and NVDA is the industry leader.AAPL the obvious question is how much bigger can they get but great products and could they be developing software for vehicles and partner with an auto maker? Probably the safest out of these 3.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 02:13:17'] I‚Äôd hold off as markets going to drop a bit more IMO. I‚Äôd buy SOXL which is currently $28.29 (might drop to $25 or lower in next few weeks). Ride it up to $35+ then sell then buy AMD which should be below $95. SOXL isn‚Äôt a buy and hold but but can salvage a portfolio quickly during a recovery like we just had.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 02:23:23'] Personally I would say all three are overvalued at current prices (Nvidia>Apple>AMD). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll necessarily lose money on any of these long term but it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll beat the index.For those who can justify the high multiples (especially Nvidia) what growth rates are you expecting? Intel sub-50 seems a better bet to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 02:27:11'] Eh. I mean, personally I prefer NVDA over AMD, but a AMD at this price is a steal. Apple for the long-term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 19:52:14'] Personally I'd say not apple, they have a lot of shitty business practices and laws in the EU and in other areas are taking aim at them. Nvidia is an extremely powerful and diverse company. AMD is a very powerful company but only at CPUs and GPUs. Personally I'd recommend Intel, they're a direct competitor to AMD, their products hold a similar quality and price point, and they pay out a dividends while still having decent growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 21:43:09'] I haven't read other comments, but AMD for sure. EXTREMELY undervalued still at 100. They are better than Intel and nVidia, PC gamers/builds are on the rise. I bought a decent amount at 75 and Rick I bought more then. But have bought more at 95. They are still extremely undervalued at 100 IMO.

Tesla has fantastic and very forward looking leadership that made a very long term plan to start with very high end EVs, and bring the costs down overtime to sell much more volume to many more consumers. Just last year Tesla's Model Y became the 4th best selling vehicle in the world, and Tesla is projecting it to become the number one best selling vehicle globally.Despite whatever contraversial things Elon might say it doesn't change the fact that Tesla's leadership has been an unquestionable success for any long term shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 19:50:54'] Based on what I‚Äôve read, you have never invested into a solid company before. Pot stocks and gaming stocks should not be invested in with the thought of long term growth. You can try and get rich quick and be broke for life, or get rich over a long period of time and be much better off. I recommend when you buy stocks, you look at the P/E ratio. It‚Äôs price of the stock divided by earnings per share. It gives you a much better indication weather a stock is over valued or not. Don‚Äôt look at stock price or % growth, look at the P/E ratio. Right now apple is at 30. The S&P average P/E is like 15. Higher P/E the more investors expect the stock to grow. Hold apple for 10 years and undoubtedly it will be worth more than it is today (not a financial advisor). Apple is a solid buy, and it will continue to grow undoubtedly. For reference amazons P/E is in the 80‚Äôs and Tesla is in the 600‚Äôs. Focus on solid companies like apple that have a competitive advantage and will continue to grow. I‚Äôd look into a S&P 500 ETF. It‚Äôs the top 500 companies in the US. It automatically filters the bad companies out and the good companies in. Stop looking at share price and % growth, and instead look at P/E of a company that is established and has a history of growth( pot stocks will always rise and fall no matter what)

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 01:20:08'] Agree with most. This is a stock you hold not one you take profits on. This isn‚Äôt a swing trade type of stock. It‚Äôs one of the top companies in the world. It‚Äôs a long play for me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 01:21:22'] ‚ÄúThey‚Äù have been saying this for years.  It‚Äôs funny how wrong they have all been.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 04:37:23'] In April of 2012 I broke my #1 investment rule: Don‚Äôt go chasing rainbows. (Buy hot stocks). I bought 5 shares of AAPL for about $3200. It has split twice since, I now own 140 shares. This has paid for every Apple phone and computer my wife and I have ever purchased with money left over. AAPL is the richest company in the world and we don‚Äôt know what the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù is, but they‚Äôve got the cash to develop it. Buy and hold.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 23:29:11'] First: Stop doing WSB behavior, especially if you‚Äôre new and don‚Äôt have much experience.Second: Diversifying your portfolio, consider ETFs.Third: Your morals or views don‚Äôt matter in the stock market, invest and trade in profitable stocks. Being all in on Cannabis or gaming is a 100% failure plan. Fourth: $AAPL is a long term hold stock due to how stable it is, same with $MSFT, $PYPL, $V, etc.Fifth: Going with expectations of making $20k in less than a year will set you up for failure if you are starting small.Sixth: View any gains as a plus, don‚Äôt jump ship on stocks every time you see a bit of green.Seventh: Losing money and having red days is part of the story when it comes to the stock market. I have had days where I gained $1k+, but also had days where I lose $1k+.Eighth: Know what you buy and follow the news on them, that way you know when to sell or buy.Ninth: Build a strategy, don‚Äôt wing it. The stock market is not a game of darts.So hold $AAPL, unless you REALLY need the money.You want stable growth making stocks at the moment? Here are a few to consider: $V, $AAPL, $MSFT, $MRNA, $PYPL, $TGT, $COST. Also consider a few ETFs like $SPY, $VTI, and $VOO.Stick to stable stocks, until you have more experience and understanding of the stock market. Then feel free to speculate on different stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 19:33:20'] Did you buy shares with an exit plan in mind? Did you do your own cost analysis to determine under/overvalued? Do you feel there's more upside potential in this investment when compared to other alternatives?Bottom line, no one can give you a definitive answer. It sounds to me from your post that you're a newer investor and don't have the knowledge yet to perform fundamental analysis. I'd consider buying a few books, learning how to become an intelligent investor, and make these decision based on your methodologies. Blindly trusting those on the internet is a sure way to underperform the market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 21:48:23'] My advice:1. Don't pay any attention to analyst predictions2. Focus on dominant market leaders3. If you are a swing trader, then set a stop loss. If it triggers your SL but rallies again, don't worry about it. Move on to your next position.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 23:08:14'] If apple is a trade for you, then I would sell into earnings. No one ever went broke taking a profit. If it is a long term hold, then let it ride. I am personally holding mine for the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 01:17:43'] AAPL has litteraly been the buoy of my portfolio, even during red days it largely compensated my unrealized losses and today it is the stock with the highest return I probably have, unless you really need cash or have very solid proof that the company has very bad news I wouldn't recommend selling
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 01:46:50'] > Ive been burned by so many stocks this year by not profit taking.No, you've been burned by focusing on the short term instead of the long term. There are plenty of stocks, especially small caps, that have been hurt by the meta this year. That doesn't mean you've been burned, it just means you need to have patience for the meta to shift back.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 02:30:57'] I hold AAPL long therm. As they keep going to buy back their own shares, the stock price itself is likely to increase. This is because, the earning per share increase du to the buy back.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 08:29:39'] Never sell..
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 08:33:12'] I've missed out on about 60k in AAPL gains. Started buying it almost a decade ago and, because I'm a moron, would buy/sell for a small gain, rinse wash repeat. This is not financial advice. I'm a window licking idiot. But AAPL and MSFT are 2 stocks that now, since 2019, I have no intention of selling unless something fundamentally changes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 09:46:12'] Lol no. If it drops just buy more. No reason to sell Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 12:45:24'] Are you buying to hold? If so, then just start to hedge your position. For the record, I'm bearish leaning on Apple at the moment. I bought some October puts on Friday, but even if I am wrong I will take some of the profit from the long position periodically to average into that put position. On that I like to say that I'm never wrong on a stock taking a downturn, but often a little early... lol.  If it falls then I will take profit from the puts periodically to buy more shares. I trade like this because then it matters not which way the market takes it at any given time, one side of the trade will always be making a gain. If it's the bearish side then the gains from that will increase my share position. Personally, I like to use the 50 moving average on the hourly chart to determine shifts in the trend, but everyone has their own thing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 12:55:12'] Have you hit the price target you set in mind before you bought in? If you were to sell now would you make at least 2 times the amount you would have lost if you sold at your stop loss? You can also scale down where you sell some and hold the rest. If the stock begins to fall then sell the rest. If it keeps rising then you‚Äôll have some shares to sell at a higher price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 12:56:33'] I bought Apple in 2012 for $21 split adjusted. I‚Äôm glad I never took profits.

It's a money-mountain. Not gonna go down unless world war starts or they say "hey no more iphones - we're gonna try making escalators"I'd ask "do I need the money in my account right now for something? am I behind on liquid savings in case something happens to my car/house/etc.?"once you ask that the answer will come to you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 22:07:52'] Time in the market beats timing the market. I had to learn this the hard way when I started putting money into stocks. AAPL will go up for ever until the end of time. You can try to squeezing ever single penny out of them that you can but you‚Äôre gonna lost potential profits compared to just holding. No matter what option you choose AAPL stocks will have red days and you‚Äôll kick yourself in the butt for not selling. And they‚Äôll have Green Day‚Äôs and you‚Äôll kick yourself for selling. My advice is hold the stock, maybe trim off some of the profit you made and hold some liquidity in your account for if/when the stock has any sort of big dip. Buying a big dip will quickly recuperate any losses in profits you may have incurred from the dip. And you can only do this if you have liquidity. AAPL is a great stock with consistent growth. And it‚Äôs never a bad idea to have good safe positions in the market to give you security for more risky plays.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 22:08:36'] If you are worry about a big sell off in earnings, I dont think it will happen. I think at most the sell off in earnings will be -2%. If I were you, I will just hold it. If you are so sure they will sell, then why not buy some puts?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 23:42:14'] Why did you buy the stock in the first place? What was your exit strategy? Without knowing why or when you bought the stocks no one can give an opinion on what to do from here. &#x200B;It really comes down to if you are happy with the current profit and won't regret selling even if the stock continues to rise or not. If so then take your profits and move on. If not then allow yourself to hold the position long term and don't fret about the price of the stock day to day.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 03:53:16'] Is this an investment or a trade? If it‚Äôs aN investment then don‚Äôt sell for another 5-10 years.  If it‚Äôs a trade then I guess you could sell now and lock in profits but if you want to trade rather than invest there are about a million better stocks to do that with than apple.  Focus on investing, based on this question you will absolutely lose your ass trading
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 04:24:00'] The one thing I would say about selling - as somebody who sold half my Apple stake at 148 before buying most back at 146 - is that I use companies like Apple and Microsoft as stores of value. I wouldn't have really care buying back in at 150, the point is that they are long term bets I am always putting money into if nothing else stands out. &#x200B;But when something does stand out, I'm willing to selling a little to free up some cash. &#x200B;So my approach would be, if you think there's a great company to throw money at, then you could consider selling. Otherwise, hold those quality companies for the future.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 07:36:30'] You could keep it and let the company do what it does: generate return on capital. That return is tax free until you sell it, compounding to greater and greater value. Or you could think of yourself as a trader, anticipating swings, finding better places to invest your capital, but‚Ä¶ most people who do this don‚Äôt do as well. When you sell it, you‚Äôll pay tax on the profit, invest in something else that may not do any better, and you‚Äôll have less capital compounding for future growth. Be smart. Sell some to diversify if needed, but don‚Äôt sell in and out of positions unless you have done deep research and you really have a reason to do so.

You get to retain some profit, if it keeps going up great more profit eventually if it goes down then you made the right call.Just my 2 cents, nfa.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 08:45:06'] IMO, sell and wait a week. Earnings have been brutal this year. Sell the news, even if the stock hasn't gone up yet. Within a week it will likely make the move it wants to and begin consolidation which will give you time to re-evaluate without experiencing the volatility

Honestly, it's rather clear you either have a money manager for part of your assets, are making part of it up as some social experiment and/or don't have experience with this, as the questions and answers from you (i read everything) are short, redundant and ineptly non indepth. Your stated reason to sell is to buy an EV and travel, fantastic; why didn't you just do that in the first place instead of dropping tens if not hundred of thousands of dollars in market?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 21:09:06'] The only reason why faang ran wasnt because they were doing well but because of the uncertainty in the current market with bond prices doing crazy shit. So everyone just parked their cash in these blue chip tech companies as a hedge against the weird market movements we had lately. Once we go back on track, I expect a huge drop in these so called 'cash parks'.Also the insane growth accelerated from the pandemic will eventually slow down and a drop in growth rate will lead into another sell off.Don't listen to these kids suggesting to hold. There is no LONG hold stock. Even the best ticker can go to 0 with a change in thesis. You always got to watch out for movements and catalysts of the stocks your holding and when the story changes, you sell off for another ticker.It could run a lil more but there are just too many potential catastrophes (slower growth, rotation, wednesday fed meeting, etc ) along the way to be a good hold at this point. You made a good play and its time to get out.

That being said I think AAPL will be very volatile post-earnings even if the report blows everyone away.  People will be taking profit, etc.My plan is to hold through earnings and sell a bit in afterhours... I think it will be a great ER and afterhours are usually more optimistic than the following day/days.

POST_TEXT: b"When the Apple M1 series came out, lots of people were saying that x86 is doomed, Intel and AMD will be out of business and every big tech companies will be designing their own ARM-based processor. In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:\n\n1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and exper"
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 05:53:07'] Apple started working on the arch in 2008 when they hired Jim Keller. Jim has designed AMD K8 and K12 (Zen), Teslas chip for autonomous drive and put down the foundation that is M1 today. Fucking legend
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 04:26:13'] There are still uses for x86. x86 processors still kick the M1 chip from Apple in the butt in a lot of tasks. M1 and ARM have though, opened up a way for more portable and efficient machines for everyday use. A lot of tasks and programs doesnt need the power hungry chips from Intel and AMD. That is an undeniable fact.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 09:00:50'] > It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architectureThis isn‚Äôt super true especially for higher levels of the stack. Device drivers and low level OS code, yeah, but for everything else it‚Äôs not hard to port to a different architecture. It‚Äôs way way harder to port to a different OS or even graphics library. The real cost is testing cycles and infrastructure, not the code.Linux already runs well on ARM and Microsoft has windows ARM. In the medium term, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more server side stuff moves to Linux on ARM. Performance per watt especially considering cooling costs is far superior on ARM and single thread performance isn‚Äôt that important. I‚Äôm surprised it isn‚Äôt the standard already.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 09:00:19'] I don't really disagree, but I think you are overstating things.  So here are my disagreements.> It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design teamAgreed, but I think there are more than a few companies that could do that (or arguably already have).  Samsung, Broadcom, qualcom, or nVidia to name a few.> It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architectureLess time now-a-days than ever before.  Particularly if you are already targeting an existing architecture like ARM.  Apple didn't make a new ARM instruction set.Very little modern software is written in such a way to make it dependent on the instruction set.> Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node.While true, the same companies I pointed out earlier ARE already using those advanced nodes from TSMC.  Really, the only difference is they've not chosen to enter the server market.However, that's something that's been changing as of late.  Because of ARM's somewhat natural energy efficiency you are starting to see cloud providers offer ARM based systems.It's really only a matter of time for some of these mobile manufacturers to decide they want a large piece of the pie.> The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains "only" roughly 54 billion transistors.You can't really point at transistor numbers and draw much meaningful conclusions.  M1 Max is both a CPU + GPU.  Further, it has a rather monstrously sized L2 cache (24MB).  The 5900X has a 4MB L2.  That's not really being inefficient with transistors.But even so.. so what?  Transistor count might push up die space requirements which decreases yield, but that's not really terribly impactful on the bottom line.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 03:46:49'] i wouldn't be surprised if M1 and its successors are beaten soon enough if volume order and cost of development/manufacturing can be justified since microsoft and apple have shown there's market for laptops with capable mobile arm64 chips like this.  on software optimization side apple has advantage of having less hardware to support, but i'm not sure that matters as much as whether a given user is looking for apple, microsoft or google software ecosystem.  https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/02/qualcomm-can-beat-apple-m1/
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 07:43:23'] Yeah, the m1 works for Apple devices because they aren't upgradable, and they aren't customizable, and their customers don't mind at all. It gives Apple more control of cost structure and makes software easier to test (ie they only have to worry about performance on a couple of hardware targets).I think Amazon, Google and Microsoft can use this model for servers, if they want, but designing and maintaining new chips is super expensive, so if Intel or amd are making chips that are "good enough", there's not much cost justification to maintain the design team. Worst case for them would be if they spent billions on a home brew chip, then Intel releases something better that same year.

We have done quite a bit of design in our history with ARM as well. We actually consider ARM as a partner in many respects.""From an AMD standpoint, we consider ourselves sort of the high-performance computing solution working with our customers, and that that is certainly the way we look at this. And if it means ARM for certain customers, we would certainly consider something in that realm as well," Su explained.[Why would intel join RISC V?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-invests-in-open-source-risc-v-processors-with-a-billion-dollars-in-new-chip-foundries/)&#x200B;You make reasonable points, but the news seems to point in the opposite direction.The next generation of ARM essentially builds into the architecture the features that Apple has been creating from scratch and making them available to the parties that choose to license out ARM designs so they configure them to make their own chips. This means other companies will have a much easier job catching up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 11:05:54'] What is a semiconductor manufacturing node?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 11:53:57'] The question isn‚Äôt whether other companies will switch to ARM with a M1-like offering of their own, but whether Apple will gain market share as a result of M1
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 17:04:12'] One other thing-Apple dictates the hardware and locks their OS so it only runs on THEIR hardware.  It has been this way for decades (there are workarounds)  Apple is the only company that makes both the operating system AND the hardware it runs on.  Microsoft might be able to pull off something like this, but it's highly unlikely given their abysmal record on hardware manufacture.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 17:49:08'] Makes sense for Apple as they can use the M1 (and varients) to power all their devices as well one language to run it all. Vertical integration to keep costs down, similar to what car manufacturers do building a common platform.Love see windows go ARM given the many advantages. There is even a ARM version of Windows. However will take a lot time and money for transition, not only CPU manufacturers but more legacy software companies not wanting to spend more money to transition.Couldn't believe the initial idiot backlash for the M1. It's a huge step  forward
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 21:59:50'] Point 2 is wrong. You can just recompile for ARM in most cases and things will just work (unless you rely on hand written assembly, but that is rare). This is why Linux systems can be migrated to ARM without an issue. I migrated a client to ARM last year and it was easy. I just recompiled the source code for ARM and that was it.

POST_TEXT: b'I am a newbie, so detailed explanations are appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Case in point:**\n\nOn Sept. 7, Apple introduced its third-generation 5G smartphone, the iPhone 14 series. It also debuted its Apple Watch Series 8 smartwatches and second-generation AirPods Pro wireless earbuds. Apple stock rose 0.9% on the news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/)'
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:50:26'] Simple answer is that that news is already priced in, due to the anticipation of the announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:52:09'] You literally have the word ‚Äòanticipated‚Äô in your question.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:53:43'] The stock does not react significantly because investors know these events will take place. Apple makes iPhones, so of course they will come out with new versions.An unexpected event will spark a significant share price movement. For example, if they delay an iPhone launch by 8 months due to supply chain problems shares will fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:04:22'] Why would it? It‚Äôs nothing new. If apple released a car, or a gaming console, or augmented reality glasses, or any NEW product, then it would make a difference. A new model of something that already exists and is released every year should have an effect because?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:58:13'] iPhone announcements each year are pretty much baked in and expected. I‚Äôd only imagine they‚Äôd impact the stock price if apple did something unexpected like announce they were skipping a launch of a new phone next year etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:55:25'] Each iPhone release has like almost a year of internal rumors, manufacturer plan leaks and all sorts of shit associated with it.The people posting these rumors have got their own following now, since they‚Äôve been correct so many times. iPhone releases are therefore priced in a month in advance sometimes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:12:27'] Because this is all public information that we‚Äôve roughly known was going to happen all along.What changes stock price is earnings and unexpected data. If we find out the iPhone sales don‚Äôt do well this year, then we could see a decline in the stock vice versa. The launch event simply means almost nothing for the day to day pricing
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:39:25'] If apple had a pattern where the stock would shoot up with every announcement, you would buy before this happened.  Now imagine hedge funds with super computers and algos/satellites run by phDs doing the same thing.Apple is the most followed stock and its also relatively easy to follow their supply chains to gain insight
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:42:28'] A 1% move in Apple stock is over $10 billion in new market cap. That's a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 17:44:39'] A stock is simply a sliver of a piece of a business and a business is valued on the sum of the future discounted cashflows + expectations of growth, etc.Analysts build models of these future cashflows and plug the # of 14's sold into a series over time as an input in the model.  The output is $$$$ and therefore expected shareprice.  Likely the observation that it was already priced in AND had the potential to not sell well means that the market shrugged when it was finally released.  Hope that helps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 22:50:44'] If it's already anticipated, then why should it shoot up?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 05:04:51'] Baked in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 11:05:28'] It's hard to move the stock by much when each share is 148/2,390,000,000 of the market cap. You gotta buy a LOT.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:02:06'] Because everyone in the world already knows a new iPhone is coming out several months in advance.  I think the trick is to get intelligence of exactly when the new phone is going to be leaked and then buy apple stock then.  Waiting until the world already knows it‚Äôs coming is probably too late.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:06:40'] Because the entire market is on fire. Unless you destroy earnings, like Netflix did, very little news would uplift a stock right now. Short-term market dynamics will drag the overall market down, which is what you are seeing with many companies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:35:01'] It‚Äôs already priced in and the new phones continue to be the same thing year after year. No innovation
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 11:37:32'] Redditvestors
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:48:07'] iphone 14 was a dud. Apple had to cut back its production projection by a large amount.  Apple stock erode -15% YTD. Short term OK. Six months out is *not* rosy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 18:42:18'] Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

The USD you sell will stay in USD and avoid the 1.5%. Note: if you do this, the USD would be charged 1.5% if you wanted to sell a us stock for a Canadian, so try to reallocate USD back into US stocks.However if you plan on dumping large sums of money then you may want to learn whatever body else is saying about N.G.Edit: i really like national bank but you cant purchase fractional shares and when i ran the calculations they were charging always above 1.5% conversion fee (1.86%, 1.92%) changes every little bit with currency fluctuation but never did i see it actually dip below 1.5%.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 10:58:08'] i started buying AAPL in 2015. This came after realizing a had a trading addiction. I was destroying myself financially by YOLOing before Robinhood made it fashionable. I disabled options trading ( except for put writing/ covered calls ),  and studied both Bogleheads and Buffet. So I have benefited enormously from AAPL - there were a lot of pullbacks during the last 6 years, and sideways trading periods. but I took on the Buffet notion of stocks as owning assets in a company and not as abstract symbols where you focus on the ups and downs of price, but look at the long term.   i held through it all, ignored the 2020 crash and just kept going about my life.. obviously the time since then has accelerated everything greatly.  My apple shares unrealized gains are spectacular. Are we finally "too toppy" at 180 and a 3 trillion dollar market cap? Maybe, but i find it hard to pull the trigger. Not just because I still believe in AAPL for the next few years, even if there is a pullback, but also because it feels like selling would be going back to the old me that tried to time the market. Maybe I am foolish but until Berkshire dumps its 40 percent portfolio share of AAPL I might reconsider.. until then maybe it is better to just remind myself that stocks are going to  both down and up but the real question is .. what will it be worth 5 years out?

Even Microsoft has a higher PE ratio then Apple as well but no one seems to bat an eye on their run up. Apple has had slower growth this year compared to Microsoft and Google so it seems like after consolidation Apple has broke out. Yes, Apple's PE ratio currently is higher than it's been at 31 and growth for the next two years is going to be sluggish but the prospects of Apple's next wave of innovation and the flight for safety is driving this run up. Apple has developed their reputation that everything they throw out on the market turns into gold so it's probably safe to say the new AR glasses which will come out in the next 18 months most likely will be the new hot thing along with a gateway to the metaverse and whatever that entails. Then the Apple car which isn't coming out soon but if it does come out may just revolutionize driving. The apple ecosystem is a titan. Then other aspects like strong stock buyback over the years and a very healthy balance sheet has ensured Apple to be the safest stock.I think Apple stock will stagnate for the next two years as growth will be somewhat limited in the next two years and YoY comparisons won't look too good but once their next wave of products start to hit in 2023 or so Apple may just add another trillion or so. This is a long term hold and you don't bet against Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 11:29:22'] Apple is staring at a massive upcoming bump in the road and I'm surprised no one here is talking about it: [https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/)This is not some minor hiccup. This is a major chunk of revenue that is likely going to be greatly diminished before long. Revenue that had the highest profit margin and lowest overhead of any of their revenue generators may be going away. Once more 3rd party app developers understand that they do not have to give apple 30% of in app purchases anymore, your going to see a lot more "light" versions of apps show up in the store that are baseline functional, but will require in app purchases directly through their 3rd party sites(bypassing apple and their skimming off the top) to unlock the full featured program. As it stands 70% of in app revenue that apple was taking was mostly from a handful of free to play mobile games(such as EPIC's Fortnight) that can now offer customers the ability to pay for in app purchases directly from the developer, cutting apple out of the purchase. Some will even be willing to incentivize costumers doing so by charging them less to go direct, rather than through apple's portals.

I don't plan to sell anything out of AAPL (It is the smallest position in my portfolio with almost 8% anyhow). I think people would put the money into AAPL (instead of an ETF or cash) while they wait to take it out and invest back into the companies they sold out of (assuming they still believe in those companies and only wanted to reduce taxes).It is possible that AAPL will correct downwards near the end of the month or the beginning of January.Just my thought though, I am not a trader so I don't bother selling even if I think something will go down.

POST_TEXT: b"*Disclaimer: This is my own speculation and opinion to kick off a discussion about Apple's future.*\n\nNo one here is a stranger to Apple's monstrous cash generation and profitability. It's been a behemoth of a stock and has basically guaranteed impressive returns for those long on it. With around a 2.1 trillion dollar market cap, it is the largest in the world. But has it gotten too big for its own good?\n\nApple is more or less known only for its iPhone and I don't know how anyone else feels but with the latest iPhone 13, nothing really feels much different or innovative. Better battery life? Camera? Storage? That's cool I guess, but nothing new that would make it stand out from its competitors. Apple has seen declining market share in the smartphone sector and it's a brutally competitive market. Nokia used to completely dominate the market back in the day and suddenly it became non-existent as it couldn't keep up with the innovation. It's like they got so cocky they were at the top and "
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 17:33:20'] Yeah, people have been saying this since Jobs died a decade ago. Here is what‚Äôs different. Last year 54% of all Apples revenue was the iPhone. 10 years ago, it was 82%. Last year Apple cleared 50 billion in revenue for services (i cloud services, Apple Music, Warranties etc). 10 years ago that revenue was 7 billion a year. Last year Apple cleared 25 billion in wearable, home gear and accessories (Apple TV, WiFi routers, Apple Watch, AirPods etc). 10 years ago that was 3 billion a year. Basically, Apple has found 65 billion a year in new revenue sources since Jobs died, and make more money (in real terms) on iPhones than they did 10 years ago. They will be fine.

If you actually read any of their earnings reports you would know this, so forgive me if I can't take your analysis seriously.

And 6... etc. For that matter, it could be said about all popular Android phones as well, with the exception of a few very niche products like foldables. > Apple has seen declining market share in the smartphone sectorSource? I can't seem to find any long-term data, but Apple's market share in Q1 2018 and Q1 2020 were both 14%. > with their absurd product pricesApple's product pricing is largely in line with competition. In fact Samsung's flagships have at times been more expensive. Their prices have also stayed the same since ~2017, and they've been doing extremely well during that time period. So obviously they're not absurd prices as far as consumers are concerned.I don't think they're going to continue growing at the same high rate, as that inherently becomes harder as a company becomes larger - but they're almost certainly going to continue growing and being successful.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 19:59:47'] Similar thoughts were said after the second iPhone. There was no where for the company to go from there. Boy where all those gurus wrong
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 20:19:42'] >Apple is more or less known only for its iPhone   I suppose it is a good thing that kids are interested in stocks and posting about it. ;)  Apple will do what Microsoft has done since 1982 or so - and replace innovation with market power and capital, and grow other related businesses. The growth from almost dead in 1997 to top market cap isn't repeatable for them, but they won't go away either.

Simply being so strict on the user privacy is doing something new that no others are doing or would dare to do. I don't think there are many who would dare to pick a fight vs Facebook.I'm not an Apple fan, I only owned an iPod Touch like 10 years ago, I don't like many of their strategies to milk as much money as possible (not being modular to replace parts easily, etc), but hey, what company is not trying to improve revenue testing the users limits?Their products are not for me, I'm not paying that much extra just for some security or a social status above what I can afford just to appear cooler, but that doesn't make me blind to the idea that whatever they are doing they are doing it great (and they will continue doing it great, no reason to think they will lag behind just for no reason other than a personal hunch because you don't like the company).The absurd prices are only absurd to those who want to buy something that it's out of their price range. But yes, their products are overpriced but luckily their main target audience doesn't care much about it.

To my knowledge, it is the only PC which uses an RISC chip rather than a CISC chip, leading to its superior battery life and performance. The Apple Watch has the best features in its class, especially for the price. The iPad is unquestionably the best product in its segment, and airpods are significantly better in terms of usability, and design than most of Apple's main competitors. The iPhone is no longer Apple's cash cow, and that's OK. Apple is clearly focusing on their other products, and that's good.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 09:44:11'] The biggest threat to apple is work from home.  A large chunk of their audience cares about what others think of their accessories.

Apple is taking over the market for wearable tech (also wearable health which is going to absoltuely explode over the next 20 years). Apple is also one of the leaders in virtual reality, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence. Apple does way more than iPhones and are actively growing their other business areas.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 17:33:02'] Apple‚Äôs 10 year growth in it‚Äôs stock price is over 900%. Unless they come up with something as revolutionary as the iPhone again it‚Äôll be hard to replicate this growth over the next 10 years. They‚Äôve innovated in the sense of AirPods and Apple Watch though these are expensive products. I hope they‚Äôre able to continue to innovate but if they don‚Äôt do anything remarkably revolutionary I think that Apple will be fine and still easily be a top 5 company by market cap in five years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 15:03:23'] worth noting, "drastically smaller" doesn't necessarily mean it won't be drastically profitable.10 years ago in 2011, apple's market cap was $337B. with a $2.1T cap today, that means it has grown a little bit over 600% in the last decade. if that growth rate gets cut in **half**, we're still talking 300% growth in the next decade.in the end, only time will tell what the future holds for apple. given the rumored car (which doesn't necessarily have to be a "car", it can simply be a partnership with car companies where they provide the  ui for the dash, stereo, analytics/diagnostics, starter, locks, etc.), as well as the expected growth of the AR/VR market (just because the AR glasses didn't pan out the first time doesn't mean it won't happen, and many people still believe AR contact lenses will be a thing eventually as well), there are definitely markets that seem ripe for explosion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 16:48:50'] You absolutely should keep asking these questions about apple, but your points fail to take a lot of context into account. Many have already said many of my points, so two points I didn‚Äôt see yet: -Nokia failed precisely because apple has the ability to innovate better than them. Nokia didn‚Äôt have an entire ecosystem of products. They just had phones. They didn‚Äôt have services. They didn‚Äôt have a whole slew of new things to add to the phone that would increase its capability to work with its other products. They had phones. -Also not mentioned: home automation. People don‚Äôt have to like where apple is with HomeKit now, but last year 20-30 million smart speakers were sold in the US (according to NPR). This is a huge growing sector of which apple is a part, and they keep improving it. Yet another area for future innovation and growth. Apple already has the apple ecosystem going for it. This will only further attract/retain customers that seek to get more out of their already existing apple products while deepening their relationship with apple.I would generally agree that phones are the biggest thing they have done in the last twenty years. But you‚Äôre also failing to see their history of incredible innovation. Just because *you* can‚Äôt imagine what they‚Äôll come up with next doesn‚Äôt mean they will come up empty handed in the next twenty years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 00:27:24'] What I find odd is the valuation of Apple. Apple is not paying large dividends and probably won't in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, Apple is worth so so much. Which company or group of companies will ever be able to straight up buy Apple? It's impossible. There are very few companies worth more than a trillion dollars. How does one pay cash or stocks worth 2.5 trillion dollars?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 10:12:56'] This would be true if Apple was actually all about iPhone. Apples Mac department is innovating massively atm. The M1 Pro Macbook Pros are currently some of the best laptops you can buy for content creation. Windows will take much longer fully transforming to ARM. New Macbook Pros have better performance, longer battery lives, better screens than pretty much any other competitor. Apple is currently fixing a lot of the mistakes they made in the past, regarding the entire Mac lineup. And there's also something about this that people don't seem to grasp. Apple was never a company that would be the first ones to implement new and shiny innovations. It's a company that puts its user in focus: Usability, what its users actually need, what they want to feel like and express, those are factors that define Apple. Theyre not LG, who tried so desperately pushing new, unfinished innovations onto the market and failing every year. Ofc its dangerous to be so reliant on iPhone, but it's not their only market. More dangerous is probably that all their assets are designed by Apple themselves. If just one of their departments (like their processor development or software) slows down, can't keep up, their entire product lineup is affected.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 20:22:09'] The majority of iPhone users nowadays buy it for the reliability, not cutting edge tech.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 21:48:52'] Apple is huge not only because of innovation but because of their commitment to offer a line of products of *unmatched* quality. Customer loyalty goes a long way and brings opportunities that competitors will have a hard time trying to match. Also, real breakthrough innovation (see launch of iPhone) doesn't have to happen every other year or even every decade. Small incremental improvements are enough to help you grow and sustain your margins until the next big one. Apple making its own chips is itself a big one IMO and it is going to bring fantastic opportunities in the future. Honestly, I cannot see Apple anything but growing for the foreseeable future. To change my opinion you will have to show me a company that is positioned to eat Apple's launch in the future. I really don't see anyone even close to being a threat right now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 19:30:10'] Apple has already talked about doing an electric vehicle, which may or may not pan out. But the bigger play for them would be moving into the cloud provider space to compete with Amazon, Google and Microsoft. If Apple could roll out a mature, security and privacy-driven cloud offering this would be their next revenue money-maker.

If China invades Taiwan, Apple's CPU supply chain will be cut off for years.  Even if TSMC were to resume services under PRC rule, I can definitely see them sanctioning US companies as a retaliation for Huawei.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:03:27'] They're gonna release their Apple Glasses or whatever soon enough, and that will propel them to new heights. Eventually I could see them merging w/acquiring Tesla in a decade or so if there's a solid enough synthesis for the "Apple Car" to become a more wide ranging hardware company with the software skills Apple can bring to bear.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:06:21'] They have metal credit cards, how much more innovation do you want!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:16:02'] Apple car ?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:39:22'] They can pretty much innovate on anything and with the customer base they have there will always be sales. Look what happened to Nokia..
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:43:06'] I think you missed Apple‚Äôs shift in their revenue generating focus. They have been shifting away from product sale for last 10 years. If you look at their revenue source service based revenue such as icloud have significantly increase. Apple has a very well designed ios that is pretty seamless for any of its users, icloud also incentivize to stay with the apple line from phone to laptop to other products. True Innovation like Steve Jobs is likely once a life time kind of things and it was also perfect timing back then. Right now Apple has built enough foothold to just focus on convenience and speed rather than trying to disrupt the market again, risk vs reward just doesnt make senseIf they were to decline in share price they need to lose revenue and likely market share. Who is going to challenge them right now? And how likely they are to succeed vs Apple‚Äôs infrastructure and enormous cash reserve?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:49:12'] I actually agree with you despite the detractors. As soon as someone does something truly next level innovative, like the original iPhone was in its time (as far as accessibility for the masses to smart phones), I think another company could easily crater them long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:49:37'] You‚Äôre partly right, they‚Äôre not innovative. That being said, the focus has shifted heavily to the ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù and ‚Äúsubscription services‚Äù because that‚Äôs where profitability sits and it‚Äôs how they‚Äôve been able to continue to grow multiple times over without little to no innovation after Jobs‚Äô death. I think you see the impact on the share price which for the most part had started to trade pretty flat.That being said, I‚Äôm not bearish on Apple it‚Äôs just a different type of trade.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:51:36'] The car or a smart home system seem like the obvious ways to go.  They will continue to find places where they can be an addictive part of peoples day.  Everything will come back to the interface.  They have such a loyal following that loves the operating system, they just need to expand on places it can continue to make peoples lives easier/better.  Growth may not be as rapid, but they are far from being Nokia.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 23:07:34'] They‚Äôre moving into a services subscription model and locking people into the ecosystem at the same time. Their services model has a higher profit margin and they‚Äôre investing heavily in subscriptions like Apple TV and bundling it with Apple one. It‚Äôll take time to build it out but they are getting big stars like Jon Stewart to come back to tv on Apple TV plus. Not to mention they have people so locked in that it would be more than a hassle to move, example Apple Card, Apple Watch, MacBook, iCloud services/privacy etc.  And since they moved away from intel for their macs they will be leading the industry in chips and over time have lower cost of production which leads to higher profit margin. Not to mention 5G still needs to be widely implemented on carriers ends so Apple will continue to sell phones for people who will upgrade in the future. I have not yet mentioned other speculative areas such as AR, or building electric cars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 23:25:44'] At least, it‚Äôll get more difficult for Apple. I live in Germany and they are heavily discussing about stronger taxation, but not only Germany. Besides that, the European Union is thinking of a universal charging cable, so that even Apple has to have a USB Type C. In my opinion, they have to start ground breaking innovations, otherwise they will decline slowly but surely.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 23:37:48'] they will venture in to electric cars and more financial products
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 23:38:32'] you must be dreaming if u think they are going to only depend on iPhones.. they have the app stores and wearables
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 23:52:52'] I'm also bearish but for a different reason. Just like Myspace got replaced by Facebook and Facebook got replaced by TikTok, Apple is going to be replaced by something new. People are joking that Apple can make a refrigerator and everyone will buy it but I think there going to be a generation soon which simply doesn't have any Apple fanboys. Apple will become an attribute of boomer-like generations for that time

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 00:19:05'] Your argument is that the hardware improvement are only marginal. The high price would eventually lead to fewer customers. However, Apple sells an ecosystem. Once you are part of it, the lock-in effects are so huge that changing to another system isn't worth it. So, for an Apple customer, it is smarter to just buy a new iPhone instead of another smartphone, especially if you consider that the interconnectivity between Apple products is better than between competing products.       Apple knows this and can even enhance the user experience by providing either new hardware like IOT gadgets or new services like Apple TV+. I think only a better ecosystem by a competitor like Google or Microsoft or technological changes can really break Apple's current business model. For example, something like a cloud phone similar to Google Stadia could change the whole market since the phone hardware wouldn't be so important.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 00:20:13'] are you kidding ? apple is no way like nokia. nokia only had the mobile phone market but apple has so much more going for it. iPhone, iPad, Macbooks, Apple+, iOS app store, apple silicon also possibly going into EV. they are not going anyway at least for the another 10-20years or even more. they have so much cash on hand to continue to build their business! there is a reason why Berkshire's portfolio is so heavy on Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 01:54:42'] My thoughts are that they will continue to be the behemoth they are today. They started moving into services years ago, and it has paid off. They can always expand on supplementary products around the iPhone/iPad and macs. From full blown services like Apple TV+ to little things like official cases for their devices.Fundamentally their brand power is insane, it doesn't really matter what they sell, people will buy it, because it's high quality, and they have that premium reputation now. They have all the money in the world to innovate, and I'm sure behind the scenes they are, it doesn't they all have to come to market though. For me they don't need anything radical, they can keep doing business as they are, and pump out high quality products and services, and it will sell well.Their latest big innovation was only recently, the M1 chip. It's insane that Apple now produces their own processor, and it's blowing everyone away.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 03:45:20'] Using the iPhone 13 as an example of lack of innovation is not enough evidence for future lack of innovation. Because looking at an upgrade between any two years you are unlikely to see a major jump in technology, Apple likes to take it slow, get it right and make it high quality. Now this is just speculation, but I feel Apple has innovation worth decades in the future and simply hold it back so that they can drip-feed the market on a yearly basis. Samsung release so many phones a year, but surely they should be the ones worried about future growth. They lead the market in innovation, but what about when that stops? That‚Äôs a direct competitor who‚Äôs only advantage is that they create phones with desirable features for a niche market. (Refresh rate, under-screen fingerprint, cheaper)
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 03:55:09'] When you have world topping money your actual performance becomes secondary to the fact that you now have your own political and economic gravity like a planet. I do not believe anyone will maintain the same technological advancement forever, not even Apple. However, like I sad, there is plenty of evidence that it does not matter as they have other means of making money and exerting influence now. I would look to them operating more independent from nation states like dinosaur USA in the future as national power begins to recede and the new political landscape comes into focus.&#x200B;TL;DR: We are now in the "waiting for the Boomers to all die off" era. If Apple successfully navigates the transition they will become the de facto new nation state.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 03:58:58'] If they do AR/VR right it will be another iPhone, but even without that their ecosystem is growing way beyond iPhone and the their new Mac platform is years ahead of any competitor and what‚Äôs now on the market is just a hint of the innovation that will arrive with the switch to apple silicon chips .
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 04:07:44'] Apple should tank, its a terrible company that takes advantages of slave labor and their products are absolute shit, not to mention they do everything they can to prevent you from being able to fix their products, and they also do everything they can to sell you their exclusive products.Literally every device besides Apple can be charged with a universal USB cable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 04:08:14'] Of course the growth will significantly decline, if the comparison is to the past 10 years. That's 100%.In the past 10 years, it grew 1100%. In the past 2 years, it grew 230%. You will not see a 2.5T company to double, triple their value easily, let alone 10X.But meanwhile it is a much more stable investment and still a high-growth company for its size (although not the same growth rate as in the past 10 years). If your point is, "if you are looking for another 10X company in the next 10 years", then Apple is not it - I agree with you and it is hardly an unpopular opinion. But if you are saying Apple is no longer worth investing because it will not deliver high growth, then I don't agree.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 04:15:43'] Apple's success isn't about innovation - it never has been.Apple lets others innovate, then over-engineers (or "engineers vastly better") what they have done, to create robust, performant [for 2 years - then they fail and user must repurchase or struggle] devices that "just work", building a deep lock-in to their ecosystem.There are millions of people whose household is "very Apple" incl. now TV and data storage/backup services, music, tablets, laptops etc and these customers are extremely, extremely loathed to change to someone else.Essentially Apple is in the milking business, and their (historically wealthy but recently less and less so) cash cows remain happier than ever to be milked, until a single brand can entirely replace them [presumably they would have to be American, too - so Samsung will struggle to win over these cows]... Which is really unlikely.It has nothing to do with innovation at this point, with respect to Apple's fortunes, though.

They need new ideas but they aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. Nokia disappeared since they didn‚Äôt jump on the smartphone wagon.

You‚Äôre not wrong that Apple will need to create new products to stay relevant, but what company doesn‚Äôt need to do that?

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 06:52:53'] Their primary pivot is going to be a focus on their subscription services and TV production. With Ted Lasso winning Emmys, having Coda (sundance film winner), and now big budget Foundation, they‚Äôre paving a road for them to become a staple streaming service.It‚Äôs not innovative compared to other companies, but if people start to view their content as ‚ÄúApple quality‚Äù or ‚Äúcool‚Äù like their devices, they‚Äôll see a massive success in their subscription model. Same goes with Apple Music and Arcade.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:04:37'] People don't give a shit about innovation as much as they do ease of use.   1.) People don't like learning new things  2.) People don't like migrating informationApple is going to keep control of that market share because they know the majority of the market they target is stupid and likes easy shit. They're not going anywhere. They just need to keep their current customers happy and they're doing that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:05:12'] Why is the unpopular? Apple must innovate or they won't see growth. The same goes for all tech companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:05:33'] Ted lasso will get em through it!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:06:18'] I‚Äôm long in AAPL. Only about 200 shares, average $70.I see the company as still very innovative - maybe not to the market, but self innovation.The iPhone has plateaued because it‚Äôs almost 15 years old so there‚Äôs only so much you can do. Just like desktop computers and then laptops. And tablets. People only need them for so many features, so naturally there will come a point where all they can do is improve specs and have fewer features to add.They‚Äôve seen that themselves, hence the huge shift to services - AppleCare insurance, Apple Music and all the new features of that (spatial audio and lossless), Apple TV is a big one (although still in its infancy), Cloud storage. On and on the list can go.Nokia was pretty much only known for making phones. No laptops. No television.  No games console. Nothing. It‚Äôs inevitable they‚Äôd crash if something bigger and better came along in their one singular category. And even then, they didn‚Äôt really try to keep up. They attempted a smart phone a bit, but IIRC they put Microsoft OS on it‚Ä¶ so you can barely call that an attempt haha.AirPods was probably Apple‚Äôs last new product category and definitely one that took the world by storm. Apple Watch just before that.I have no doubts they‚Äôll be able to do it again, but those new categories are maybe 1-2 per decade. And we know from strong rumours they‚Äôre working on AR glasses which the newer iPhones and iPad Pros are helping gather data for. Plus Apple Car as well. The car no doubt will be a huge one. AR glasses remains to be seen, but will become one of those things like AirPods where people laugh at first, then a year later they‚Äôve bought some anyway.For now they can coast on their reputation and quality to get by comfortably until they‚Äôre ready to reveal something to the world.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:23:36'] I always hear this about apple every year. But i continue in the real world hear about everyone upgrading phones, buying macbooks etc‚Ä¶ This last year with there processors was a huge leap in technology for laptops moving from intel. Apple is always innovative but it does require great minds in the same room.Apples ecosystem is very polished compared to others and that‚Äôs something you cannot take lightly. They have very firm base of phone followers who love to upgrade every year not because they expected something great but because they want a new phone. Until this starts to change I‚Äôm long on the stock.If you really believe Apple isn‚Äôt changing things you can always sell now and get back in later.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:24:53'] All talk, spoken by a thousand wanna-be pundits over many years.  All of whom have repeatedly tried to be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù that predicts Apple‚Äôs downfall.  Blah, blah, blah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs always the same.  Hoping to garner enough reads so they can then buy in on a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:25:21'] The world is a big place, and a lot of this big world is Apple customers. It will take continued large scale innovation, but Apple has the cash to do it. I agree, in the next 20 years, Apple can not grow like they did in the last 20 years. At this time, I'm holding AAPL, but not buying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:29:39'] I agree that the main point from Apple is the iPhone. But I feel like Apple has been making it more attractive to pull people inside their ecosystem through the iPhone. I think we have indeed reached a plateau where the phones are already pretty good and unless a major shit on technology happens we will not see major changes. But even tho the iPhone hasn‚Äôt changed much, products like the Apple tag, iMusic, and mainly the air pods trap people inside their ecosystem and keep them buying new products. More over, Apple has been pushing their replacing program of giving your old device for a discount on a new one. They say this will help reduce carbon footprint, but a second effect of this is that there will be less second hand iphones on the market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:38:13'] I agree with you on the product revenue part, but with the ecosystem apple has set up as well as the services they are starting to provide, there needs to be a real change in the industry for apple to decline enough to adjust
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:43:27'] Just, LOL
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:45:26'] Don‚Äôt forget Apple is trying to join in the automotive sector by producing their own Apple car in the future. The iPhone isn‚Äôt the only source of income, nor do they solely rely on iPhone sales each year. Apple has a vast array of other services they provide plus with the whole Apple ecosystem, they will continue to flourish for years to come and I cannot imagine a future where Apple suddenly becomes non-existent like Nokia.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 07:46:45'] Apple has been very good at that over the years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:00:17'] I generally agree with the exception that Apple has enough money to buy almost any start up or even mid sized tech company. They don‚Äôt have to grow organically to grow.But it‚Äôs hard to keep compounding at 2.1T.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:09:51'] Innovation doesn‚Äôt have to be innovation if having an iPhone is seen as a status symbol plus the ecosystem is really what‚Äôs pulling people in
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:12:01'] First of all, Nokia sales tanked because those things were so indestructible you never had to buy a second phone.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:17:46'] As long as we dont live in the matrix there will be lots of new tech that people wanna buy and people wanna buy the good stuff, so people buy apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:23:19'] That‚Äôs neat. Okay, so whose turn is it to post this next week? People have been saying Apple is on the decline since when, 2000?That iPod will fail.That iPhone will fail.That new iPhone will fail.That iPad will fail.Cutting ties with intel? Oh that new chip will fail.The thing is that Apple does innovate, but y‚Äôall think that dramatically changing the look of iPhone is some form of innovation. Y‚Äôall say that and unironically say people just want a cool looking piece of tech that ‚Äúisn‚Äôt powerful.‚ÄùApple has made the most powerful phone on the market for the last 4 years.Apple making the A series mobile chips and the M series desktop/laptop chips is a huge innovation. Y‚Äôall just couldn‚Äôt spot innovation if it hit you in the face. Innovation isn‚Äôt always ‚Äúcreate some magical new tech that looks like it fell off the back of an alien spaceship.‚Äù Apple has never been the first to make something‚Äîthey‚Äôve always been about trying to give professional equipment to the masses.I think they‚Äôre going to be fine, y‚Äôall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 21:53:04'] Welcome to the hype cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:44:59'] So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.The truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.I would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?The answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.In the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.Which brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.In 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 01:10:51'] Most of the 3d printing stocks I am interested in are companies that are still private. I would really like to get in on some 3d printed housing companies like ICON. I think for 3d printing in general, it might be too late to jump on that bandwagon. But if you find markets like housing where 3d printing could actually revolutionized the way things are done, it can be a nice investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 03:49:25'] As already mentioned in this thread be aware of the hype cycles surrounding these topics!Apple has been rather low-key about AI but they are very serious about it I think. Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user‚Äôs surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.W.r.t. green energy I‚Äôd recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play.

In the past few months a few large hedge funds have moved in. Particularly Point72, steve cohens fund. He owns 7% of the company now and I see it moving higher eventually. It seems like a good company and I can understand what its goal is. Current price is 1.85.

Picking individual titles of distruptive technologies is high risk gambling.Algonquin just cut their dividends by 40% and lost more than 50% in valuation. Investors left the boat en masse Be careful.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 10:50:30'] My approach to AI stocks is a "Picks and Axes" approach. I have money in Nvidia, since their cards are almost always used in top-end computers. I have money with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because many AI programs use cloud storage as a means to keep the data that they supply the AI models.Which company will best monetize AI? I don't know. Will they use an Nvidia graphics card and cloud-based information storage? I believe so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 11:26:54'] I'm in both Algonquin and Brookfield.  Algonquin has a tougher slog ahead given that they're targeting traditional poles and wires investments and they've recently been denied their merger with Kentucky Power and reduced their dividend. Their capital will be quite costly in this interest rate environment so at this point, I'm not sure how they can deliver above market returns. But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.Brookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.I'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere.

I have a good number of shares at 78.Lots of small companies have been on a downcycle recently, so their stock performance isnt great. For the buy low sell high mantra, things are not looking horrific however. For green tech,I like RIO under 60, copper and rare earths. For more risky/speculative, I like TLGRF (battery anode + mining) at $1.00 usd or lower, which it is roughly at now. and I think something for the watch list is PYR; they might go through a reverse split in the next 6 months. if that happens, once the dust settles I will have to go in. There is no rush. I do not see the next 2 months as good for the market. I recommend waiting or DCA, and only after doing your own DD. These are ideas that I like. Two safe ones, and two risky ones.

POST_TEXT: b'The Justice Department Monday endorsed legislation forbidding large digital platforms such as Amazon and Google from favoring their own products and services over competitors, marking the Biden administrations first full-throated support of the antitrust measure.\n\nThe Department views the rise of dominant platforms as presenting a threat to open markets and competition, with risks for consumers, businesses, innovation, resiliency, global competitiveness, and our democracy, says a letter to bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, signed by Peter Hyun, the Justice Departments acting assistant attorney general for legislative affairs.\n\nThe letter, obtained by The Wall Street Journal, expresses support for the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which the Senates judiciary panel approved in January in a bipartisan vote, as well as similar legislation moving through the House.  \n\n[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 07:59:40'] Too little too late. Anti-trust was neutered  long ago. So corporations have captured control of the production infrastructures into the hands of a very few oligarchs.  Citizens United delimited bribes.  So Corporations have also captured the legislatures who would make any laws which might limit or control their actions.  This bill is just a head fake meant to gather some votes for the legislators.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 19:57:51'] Because they were cartoonishly overpriced and we were saying it at the time but so many people had too much money to know what to do with so they kept dumping them into blue chips.Tesla valuation is still a farce. It should be less than Toyota‚Äôs
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 21:02:07'] You really need to look at each company individually
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 00:48:49'] As a non-US based in investor I think it would help US investors to look at things from the formers perspective to get a better idea of what‚Äôs happening. A lot US stocks are flat / down despite the run up in USD terms since the USD has weakened quite a lot over the past few months.As a EUR investor, the only thing that‚Äôs really ballooned again is tech when factoring in FX rates movements, and it seems to more based of potential changes in interest rate policy rather than fundamentals, because the fundamentals (both individual company & macro) aren‚Äôt trending amazingly well. My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc‚Ä¶have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week. The rest of my holding is house money so happy to ride it out incase I‚Äôm wrong, but I think there‚Äôs more downside for tech in the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 20:29:20'] A correction and being down are two different things. GOOGL more or less corrected.Amazon corrected.Telsa corrected to fair when it was around $100, depending on your arguement its fair or still overvalued as hellMETA (at the time) was fine but now is more or less correctedNVDA is still overvalued as hellAPPL is overvaluedMSFT is overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 04:03:33'] Tech companies have very good cash flows, but their potential growth **is already priced in**.They also face tough competition in many departments and the barrier of entry for competitors is low.If you're looking for good investment opportunities, looking at literally where everyone's looking and putting their money on is a double edged sword.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:41:31'] NVIDIA: Driven by AI bubbleApple: Probably because it is viewed as the safe haven for blue chips, and is continuously bought by 401ks and other retirement and hedge funds.Microsoft: A combination of AI hype and following apple, I'd imagineAmazon: Still down because amazon has flipped to losing money. All the other 3 tech stocks above are still making money hand over fist.META: Meta-verse cash burn fears seem to still be prevalent. if META dropped their metaverse plan, I think the stock could rise substantially from current levels, also could partly be recession ad-spending fearsGoogle: Recession ad-spending fears Tesla: Very hard to properly value, margin fears, PE ratio would argue that it still could be overvalued even at current suppressed prices. I think their valuation is heavily tied to future FSD success. If tesla actually pulls through and completes FSD, they are very undervalued at current prices

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 20:45:45'] Because people on TV constantly talk about companies like NVDA, MSFT and APPL.   The hype machine is in full swing again.  Once people finally look at the forward PEG #s and realize they are buying into an unrealistic investment they will sell.

Indications show all these FAANG tech stocks will stay at this level or have more room to fall more.Back in 2020 the Feds basically forgot to charge interest so borrowing was free.

Tesla has to lower its price to keep the factory utilized and that ate the margins affecting its earnings.

But that hasn't been panning out...so far.  And for good reason...the market makers are literally collecting paychecks like candies from ppl who laugh at theta.I'm not a bear or bull.

POST_TEXT: b'I left a job last year and rolled over both my Traditional & Roth IRAs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:31:38'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 15:45:22'] As long as the strike is at a price where you would be comfortable selling your position, I think CC's are hard to argue against. Traditionally your enemy is taxes but in an IRA that is irrelevant.I also really don't see a reason not to write very far otm CCs on your heavier positions if you're at all concerned with the capped upside that others on this post have highlighted. I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.Cash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 18:00:38'] This is what I‚Äôm doing right now with AAPL. Though it‚Äôs a struggle because it recently went just above my strike price of $165. However, with the seesaw nature of the market this year, it will likely be fine in time. In a more bullish market I would sell even .15 delta or lower. It‚Äôs often compared to picking up pennies in front of a steam roller. However, getting ‚Äúcrushed‚Äù with blue chip stock usually looks like capping your gain and selling CSEPs until it corrects back down, which could be next week, I could be never‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 07:25:13'] I mean, no amount of prep work or backtesting on preset data is going to secure gains when there are more unknowns. And using anything from 20-22 isn‚Äôt great data, as a monkey could make money during Covid. Anything you can do now is apply it but 30% gains on trading is not going to happen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 07:50:14'] Being in the stock market is like being on a poker table. You have to know how you feel when real money is on the table. What do you feel if a stock goes down 10 percent on the day you bought it? And keeps going down for weeks even if there was no real news. Do you still trust your own analysis?What do you do when a stock you bought does not move at all for 12 months?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 08:09:58'] THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A  "WINNING STRATEGY FOR BEGINNERS".If there was something this simple that you could come up with dont you think billion dollar traders might have programmed that already?  If you want to trade then fine start with really small trades and be prepared to lose 75% of it.  It hurts to lose $50 right?  Just throwing away money?  Well if you arent prepared to throw away money then dont trade because you will do that everyday.Investing for the long term is a different thing entirely.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:47:06'] Everyone has their own method for trading. Maybe you got lucky, maybe you didn't. Only one way to know is to throw your money into the market.To answer your question though, I think you're a bit delusional, but that's the case for every new trader. You only become a bit more sane once you rack up some losses imo.The market is vastly different from 2016. Patterns won't do you much good at all when the whole market is moving. Trend may show that for example, Amazon, will go up, but then a jobs report or cpi or the fed comes out and says shit and it tanks. Speaking of Amazon, their chart moved quite differently in 2016 than it does now.Market moves up and down on news, news that you can't predict accurately without insider information. You can guess, and it may work out sometimes, but all it takes is a few bad times to lose it all. Since you're talking about 30% gains, I get the vibe you're a high risk trader, so you'll feel the pain soon enough.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:12:03'] I agree with others. Paper trading or back testing is not the same with real money. I started investing in index funds over 10 years ago. I then got comfortable and started being a buy and hold investor for certain companies. I learned a lot by taking losses along the way but eventually three years ago I started options trading. I again took losses trading options until I refined my strategy and now this year I‚Äôm up 14.6% YTD (vs 8.3 for SPY). I learned from every loss and I‚Äôm still learning. I now mostly short bull put spreads, sell covered calls and open short strangles and iron condors on SPX with short legs delta 16 with 37 DTE. I‚Äôve now learned to reduce risk and volatility and all the same time generating an exceptional return but this took over 13 years of sweat and tears and losses. And I‚Äôm still hopeful and know that to be really successful I need to show that I can beat the index over the long run and that this isn‚Äôt a fluke. Throughout my time investing I‚Äôve learned that you must be open to new ideas. I was a big fan of indexing and buy and hold and I think for most people this works. But I‚Äôm passionate about math and trading and have found buy and hold and indexing for me actually is more volatile than doing what I do now which is shorting options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:10:00'] Trading is just a fancier term for gambling . The problem is even if you are making the right bet, your timing might be off. The stock market is very irrational. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend trading.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 21:00:57'] No, you are 100% not ready. Every beginner thinks trading is about strategy. It is not. Every strategy works sometimes and sometimes not. No strategy works all the time. Trading is 10% learning the technical analysis/strategy and 90% mindset. That‚Äôs why back testing doesn‚Äôt work. You have no emotions involved. It takes minimum 2 years to learn how to just be profitable because it takes that long to adjust your mindset.  If you are wondering what the hell is a trading mindset then you are really really really not ready. The way a trader thinks is completely different from everyday logic. That‚Äôs why it takes a long time because you‚Äôre training your brain to think in away that it has never think before. Come to r/realdaytrading if you are serious about learning how to trade. Lastly, I already know that you won‚Äôt listen and will trade with real money soon anyways. You will lose and either quit or start over and learn the correct way. Or worst you will start to win and will think you figured it out. It‚Äôs so easy. What the heck are all these people talking about. Then one day you will lose it all. Because it was all luck and you have built up really bad trading habits when you made the money in the first place. And now it‚Äôs even harder to learn the right way.  This will happen 100% of the time.

POST_TEXT: b'Always read if you bought Apple 10 years ago at xxxx it would be worth xxxx today. People assume it was luck or smart to buy then and easy hold with how the solid company is.\n\nI read thousands of articles over the years saying Apple peaked, Android has caught up, techs dated, price to high, sales down...you name it. Holding long is hard is the point, no matter the company. Whether its negative press, stock down or stagnant too.\n\nApple brand is why I held, they withstood some bad years with making non innovative products due to loyalty and branding product so well.\n\nAnd thats why Im also long on Tesla, Netflix, peloton....over valued or not. The company to perfect a product first and build a following is tough to over throw, if they stay innovative.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 00:19:14'] Interesting post. A friend was lamenting the other day that he didn't buy AMZN at 20 way back in the day. I asked him if he thought he would have held it all the way to 3000 if he had.We both agreed that we probably would have sold at around 100. If not then, than definitely at 300-500. Holding a profitable stock long term really is incredibly difficult. You have to have an almost fanatical belief in the company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 04:42:53'] I think the best advice I've seen floating around out there goes something like this:1. Buy great companies. 2. Try to pay a decent price. 3. Hold. Easier said than done, but it sounds like that's exactly what you did here. Kudos. And long AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 23:51:28'] AMZN holder for 13 years. When you continue to hold a stock that gave you massive gains and basically just keeps going up with no reason for you to sell, it doesn't make you or me a smarter, better, or more inspirational investor than anybody else. Just luckier.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:29:58'] Amazon has had a 20-30% sell off almost every year since 2002. The best way to ride these out without selling is DO NOT LOOK AT YOUR PORTFOLIO EVERY DAY. Nothing leads to bad decisions more than watching the gyrations by the minute, hour, day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:59:48'] My dad bought me Costco shares in 2001 based on my first grade logic of "everyone goes to Costco and it's always busy"... Turned out to have been a great investment where the $10 special dividend last year equates to a 30% yield on cost on top of the 600+% gain in the share price. Luckly my dad has taught me to be a investor and not a trader. Some of my worst investing decisions have been selling a stock. I sold Square which I bought at $30 because I thought the pandemic was going to destroy their small business revenue. I was kinda right but Wall Street didn't care.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 01:43:36'] Apples PE ratio was around 20 in 2005/2006. Tesla is currently sat at a PE ratio of 1023, do not compare the two situations üòÇ.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 01:55:43'] You can't compare Tesla's run to Apple.  In the last 15 years; Apple has never 7 or 8x in ONE year.  I'm not even sure Apple has made over 100% in a one year period;  someone can check that.   Apple moved slowly and surely through the years while Tesla rocketed 700% in one year.When Apple was 650B, equal to what Tesla is right now; they were extremely profitable not barely like Tesla.  Also, it was around this time they started paying the dividend and Berkshire went in.  They were already making in excess of 10B in net income per year and didn't have to relay on EV credits to become profitable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:05:05'] I've owned AAPL since 1998. I had investment friends advise me to pull some or all out at various points because I had such a large part of my portfolio's value tied to it, so I did but I have started to reinvest more. I should have trusted my own instincts. I will tell you that almost every time there is an Apple product announcement, the stock takes a dip, which is a good time to buy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 08:56:20'] I bought Apple around 2015-2016 (pre-split) between 90 and 110 a share. Now I own 4 times the shares and don‚Äôt plan to sell for another 5-10 years.Around that time Apple was mis-categorized as a hardware and a cyclical company. There was an analyst who recommended a short sell at 95! He, like many others felt that iPhone sales had peaked and Apple's best days were behind it. I bought Apple believing that it should be valued much higher than good consumer staples with little or no growth like Coke and P&G -- at above 20 times earnings; Instead, Apple was  getting sold at 10 to 12 times after having grown revenues 15 fold in the last 10 years! I believed that the future growth would come from services and wearables.It took a Warren Buffett to get Apple to its rightful multiple and valuation‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt expect Apple to fall below 25X earnings in the future. It‚Äôs in the sweet spot of being a stalwart, consumer staple with growth from at least two segments ‚Äì services and wearables.To me, Apple‚Äôs greatest strength is its integration of hardware and software, it‚Äôs really a system on chips from start to finish ‚Äì completely integrated and the best product in all its categories, which allows it to increase prices and have the best margins in the industry, and throw up gobs of cash!Apple‚Äôs best days are ahead of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 10:04:53'] I am a long term hodler of AAPL. My average price is less than $24/share. I just wish I hadn‚Äôt taken gains along the way and kept original purchases. They have mostly done well in the last decade. I did recently (last year) setup DRIPS on my account so my average will go up, but I‚Äôd rather not think about that LOL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 00:00:04'] Why are people so hard on peloton?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 10:02:12'] Fellow ex-Apple (AppleCare at home) employee here from 2012-2015, accumulated what amounted to 104 shares as of late last year after splits. Sold about 3/4ths of them to fund purchasing some land off a lake to build our forever home on. Still holding 24 shares with a cost basis of $17.91 / share :)
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 04:21:35'] I'm long on apple (2 years now). I hardly check the price because it is that reliable. My obviously not financial advice is to buy now while their foray into the car industry is in its infancy. You honestly can't go wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 02:00:24'] Peloton, IMO is a stupid bet - they aren't unique in any way and that is why, they are catering to a small market who is rich and will be irrelevant within a couple of years because there is nothing proprietary to what they sell. They didn't create anything unique.... the software isn't unique, literally - nothing is unique. When you look at Tesla, Netflix and Apple - they are game changers. Peloton doesn't embody that.After diving into this post and the comments - it seems this is heavily based on luck and people who didn't know what they were doing or didn't put in the research to see what was coming. We live in a data / information driven age now and we are able to see trends and where money is going to be pushed / circulating. The fact that some of you lucked out on Apple is what it is ....luck, because you did zero research and ended out on top.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:40:18'] PE PE PE. Everyone always loves comparing companies that cannot be compared using PE. These people are misinformed about what PE is and when is can be appropriately used for statistical comparison. If you really want to compare Apple and Tesla valuation over time, PEG is a far superior (still has issues). Compare their historical PEG ratios and you will see a different picture.Edit: this was suppose to be reply to some misinformed comment about PE. I guess my old man fingers slipped.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 22:16:03'] Cool. I like this perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 04:53:50'] Same here.  I bought Apple about 15 years ago with my first work bonus.  It wasn't much, but it has done well for me.  However, I made the mistake of selling half when it doubled to get my initial investment back.  I have been holding it in my Roth IRA and it is half the portfolio.  I will probably hold until I am required to take distributions.  I am excited to how where it is 30 years from now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:00:44'] Thing is for every apple we have 200 go pro.Hold is great if the companies does well for many years.Look at the s&p 500...in the past 20 years over half of the companies that were part of, are not there anymore, and nearly 100 got delisted, took private, failed or are lower price than 20 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 13:17:25'] I first bought AAPL in 2000 and have been buying monthly pretty much since that initial purchase. At this point I have around 2,500 shares, I would have more but I‚Äôve sold some shares here and there. I am holding this and other companies I own until around 2028, when I retire and hopefully use all that money to buy a house.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 05:16:46'] Bullish on everything OP mentioned but Peloton. I understand their biz model is a bit more future proof with device registrations and such? Just have a hard time visualizing a strong time horizon with that one. I only see acquisition by Alphabet or something as an out? Exercise bikes without an iPad you can pick up at any yard sale for $5. (Not shitting on ‚Äòem, would someone mind explaining a bit of DD why they should be lumped with Apple, Tesla etc long term)
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 04:36:49'] that innovation part is the tough spot. I‚Äôm an investor myself, and a huge collector of apple products for past 10years. I‚Äôve had every iphone, apple watch, ipad, airpods, and 4 macbooks. I fear that Tim Cook is turning, and focusing on products that sell en mass rather than a focus on a premium product. I understand the race for market share, but the focus on quality experience over quantity of sales is what made apple magical. I hope they stop this race to the bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 05:36:43'] I‚Äôve held Apple since 1994. It wasn‚Äôt always easy given the turmoil and lack of direction they faced in the 90s. But it‚Äôs an investment I made and have expanded over time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 06:34:13'] Very smart choice! I bought apple after 4s came out (Siri had just been released and I knew this company wasn‚Äôt messing around). I dumped my stock at iPhone 8 time (upset about headphone jack and lack of innovation). I just bought apple again at a ridiculously higher value than when I sold. I lost a lot of money by being fickle.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:00:00'] In high school (late '90s) there were nothing but headlines about how Apple was going down the toilet any day. "Beleaguered Apple" was a phrase in many of them. I was admittedly a bit of a fanboy but I believed in them, what they were doing, where they were going. There was nothing I could do but put my money where my mouth was and buy a few shares with money I'd saved up. A full 10% of the money I had to spend went to the brokerage fees, ouch. But I held, and now I'm selling some off just because it's the majority of my portfolio and I ought to diversify a bit (I have other investments, it has just overtaken them all). Similar deal with Tesla a while back. I blocked Seeking Alpha because all the headlines I was getting were "Tesla is overvalued", "Here comes the next Tesla killer", etc, it was like they were out to get them. I didn't own any shares (felt like I missed the boat), but when I saw a headline that said "Tesla at lowest price in 3 years", I couldn't pass it up. It's now worth like 10x and I'm kicking myself for not buying more (I know, you can't). Point is, I believed in them and what they were doing, and the headlines were all downers, and I plan to hold for years to come. Trading is fun but sometimes you just gotta hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:03:06'] Good thing when I buy a stock I just hold forever. Good stock? Hold. Bad Stock? Hold. I‚Äôll probably still be holding thousands of years after I die.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 07:38:11'] I purchased 160 shares after the 7-1 split in 2014 and have held it all until just after the 4-1 split in August 2020. I sold 30% and put it into TSLA.  I believe so strongly in both of these companies that I plan on holding onto all these shares for quite some time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 08:20:16'] Let's see their market share once giga Berlin opens up. It's stupid to compare marketshare in Europe before that. The taycan doesnt beat model S plaid + and the plaid+ is cheaper. With the plaid + you get way more for your money across many different metrics. Also how many people buying it are going to be racing around a track? How many Taycan is porche making every year? Nothing compared to Tesla. Even at that crazy price they still wont be profitable for many years to come if they try to become competitive price wise. Anybody chosingba Taycan over a Tesla is just throwing away money for a lesser product.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 13:14:06'] I bought Apple because my mom, who has zero clue about tech, told me to buy Apple. Did it like 7-8 years ago (can't even recall when).Made around 500% on that investment. I did nothing except look away. So I'd argue you could also just have put the money there and never look again untill you needed it. Wasn't a difficult investment for me at all.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 00:34:19'] The fortitude to hold thru highs and lows when you are convinced of a company value deserves some praise.But seems you are discounting the fact you also got lucky, both with timing and ticket choice. Suggesting that valutation doesn‚Äôt matter is wrong, and being the first to perfect a product is no guarantee of continued successs.Let‚Äôs talk about valutation and timing:You held Apple during a great bull market, when many lots of companies did great.What if you bought tech at the height of the .com bubble? It may have taken ten years to recover your investment, and many stocks would still be at a loss after 20.So you want to avoid buying at such a peak. How to do it? That crash came following crazy valutations. Valutations do matter a lot, especially for a long term investor.Buffett always looks to buy at a discount on fair value, to have a margin of safety. A company can be both an amazing business and a terrible investment, if you pay too much.The market has been defined a voting machine on the short term and a weighting one on the long. That‚Äôs why if you plan to hold long term you should be especially concerned about value.Holding long doesn‚Äôt justify paying too much, it‚Äôs the opposite. You can pay too much if you are holding short term and taking advantage of a trend.Overpaying to hold long term, you are betting that the market will stay irrational until your company eventually grows into its inflated price. Success depends on two conditions both being true, adding to risk.Which brings to stock choice. Optimism on the long term future of a business is often misplaced.Cisco in the 2000s was considered a guaranteed winner of the internet revolution. Network equipment, powering the internet! It looked like Tesla does today, at the top of a new and exciting world change.21 years later, Cisco‚Äôs price is still down roughy a third from its peak. History is full of such falls from grace. Beware of survivor bias.>	The company to perfect a product first and build a following is tough to over throw, if they stay innovativeSuch a big and unguaranteed IF, given as an aside, feels like intellectual cheating. How can you be sure that they will remain innovative in the right ways (and execute well, as importantly)? It‚Äôs a huge question mark.You point to Apple, I point to the leaders before it, Nokia and Blackberry. Who would have guessed at their peak that they would have ‚Äústopped to innovate‚Äù?Look at your new picks, three out of four you mentioned are memes.Peloton for example, it isn‚Äôt comparable to Apple. There is an element of prestige in owning a brand phone or car, because they are items you use in public. Not so much an indoor bike.What stops anyone else to offer a comparable product at better price? Nothing.You think they will succeed long term because of brand loyalty? Here is a funny scenario: what happens if Apple starts selling an exercise bike, integrated with FaceTime and updated social connectivity for iPhone users? Where will the ‚Äúcool‚Äù Peloton users go?What happens when people go back to the gym? Peloton targets wealthy users who can afford top gyms with a pleasant ambience, which offer a superior experience to home training. Being close to lots of real people working hard has a pumping effect in itself, it‚Äôs more fun and gets the adrenaline flowing, you feed on each other‚Äôs energy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 09:33:42'] Just to be clear to all the people thinking they will just buy and hold Apple, which I see and hear a lot of still, don't. This is not going to repeat itself. Doubling on Apple literally requires its value to increase by multiple -trillions- of dollars. Has Apple peaked? Probably not. It will show steady and slow intermittent growth for years to come. But it definitely does not have the potential to grow that a lot of other companies do.

I originally bought into VW(VWAGY) and Porsche(POAHY), because, as they say over at r/wsb, ‚ÄúI like the stock‚Äù. I bought both just because I like the brands. Didn‚Äôt spend much, maybe 300 bucks between the 2(enough to get me 19 shares, 6 VW and 13 Porsche). It was just nice knowing I was part owner of car brands I have always loved and respected. However given the press lately I am looking at adding to both positions(Porsche owns 53% of VW) and seeing where we are in 10 or 15 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 05:32:22'] There would definitely had been some tempting times to sell Apple. But apart from the moment Apple starting selling iPhones in 2007/8 and this past year, its PE has never been above 18 and its always had huge cash reserves. You never had to hold at a triple digit PE like you do with those other companies you listed. It seems like they're quite different situations. Imagine if Apple traded at a 70 PE in 2015 (which would make it worth the same as today but without the earnings to support it) and you held...you'd have 0% return for 6 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 05:34:59'] Same here. I am up 8X on AAPL. When I bought it it was "dead" "facing competition from Samsung", and everything else. It dipped hard that year and I picked some up and it has been my most successful investment ever.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 06:25:07'] I bought Tesla in 2018 not knowing about any of the popularity with certain stock subs, I just felt the product they were bringing was going to be big.Boy was that a good investment.  I will admit I didn't realize the spike was happening (I tend not to closely monitor individual stocks).  When I realized how high my tesla had gone I started selling a bit to lock in some gains only to have it drop a bunch recently.  Now I'm sitting on it waiting (hoping) for it to recover so I can lock in more gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 06:25:35'] Agreed.  New investors don't get this.I think looking at ones stocks to much can be partly the issue.  Makes person act emotionally -- which surprising most investors are.Not that is should make a difference, but dollar amount and not a percentage also makes people more jumpy.  Example:  5% of 1,000.  vs. a 5% move on 1,000,000 :)  Logical it should not make difference to a person, but physiologically it a whole different story.News and sentiment drives people choices.  I also think the large fish purposely love to generate volatility and for that exact reason.   They feed of the small "insecure" fish, people think stop losses are "good", when in realty those can murder you if set them to tightly.  I tend to not use them.  Netflix when they dropped heavily when they wanted to rename and spin off DVD way back, that crap was nuts ... wild & "suspicious" ride that was.  But its a good example of the physiological ride, the correct thing would have been to add 2/3 on the way down, then another 1/3 where one guess the bottom was.  But the realty was the brave held  for dear life (not daring to buy a single addition point), and the majority just dumped out of panic and never bough back.   Then after it rocked the "brave" that had held and never added when seeing 40% profit sold their positions (after that ride, 40% looks pretty great) .. and only the very, very rare trader help and did the 2/3, 1/3 adding to their positions ... and again the hedgies make their millions/billion and murder the small fish.  It has been this way since black Friday.  Nothing new.So yea, to hold a stock it really ... really hard IMO and not as easy as people think.  They look at chart history and think it was an "easy" ride ... when it never is.I favor larger cap companies with good track records, but even large companies can go belly up ... and I think infinitely holding a stock can be dangerous too.  The good think about large can is they much harder for hedgies to generate artificial volatility.At the end of the day, investing is a physiological game mostly with yourself IMO ... with no easy answers.I have been trading on and off since before .com crash, 9/11 ... that crap was nuts.  Then came house market crash and the more resent Armageddon "we all gonna die" of covid crap.  Even Buffet made a statement that "now he had seen it all", yet that man had allot of cash on hand when it happened and they added allot of positions after the tanking.Trading is really not for the faint at heart.I really don't have any good advice to give.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:23:18'] Netflix‚Äôs recurring revenue and sub base could be stickier than you think. To the effect that they may even be a recession resistant name since you could argue it‚Äôs the last subscription to cut. I also think that their content ecosystem and developed brands is strong relative to competition and they have the best penetration to introduce better targeted/marketed content to the biggest audience. The data they have on viewer preferences is the best and I think they are able to leverage this against competition that may need higher per sub investment to develop the write content mix.I would also reframe your point about their competition. You could argue they have a competitive advantage as a pure play in the space. The other big names are diversified and while that brings resource and expertise I think in the end, higher capex properties, like media production and distribution, may be candidates for divestitures/spin offs. Not to say bigger players couldn‚Äôt win but it‚Äôs not a sure thing just because they have deeper pockets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:09:36'] In my opinion theyre all expensive companies. They trade with high multiples of market to book value and price/earnings/CF metrics. Not to say it isnt justified given their performances are phenomenal but all upside predictions are pricing in growth using assumptions and it is very possible they can drop a significant amount still. Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much. I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:29:10'] Yeah, I don't see where Netflix goes from here. Before, Netflix was gobbling up all kinds of collections of movies and TV. Then they were expanding into making their own originals and many of those were really successful. Then the pandemic happened where people were consuming tons of TV. Now? All three of those are still going on, but I don't know if it's quite enough to maintain the massive growth of the past. Users have such high expectations of Netflix, so Netflix has to spend so much money to keep up, especially when there are competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 02:59:36'] Just my opinion, but streaming isn‚Äôt going anywhere and Netflix is optimizing for higher monthly payments. This will work because they have good addicting content. They may not grow to the moon, but they will continue to grow.Google however, is a one-trick-pony (search) masquerading as a conglomeration (Alphabet) - None of Google‚Äôs other ventures amount to anything.  The problem Google has is that ChatGPT and other AI is just about to upend search in a huge way (it‚Äôs really, really disruptive and yes, it‚Äôs that good). And once someone else wins search, Google is effectively dead overnight. Don‚Äôt think Google is dead overnight? I present to you that Google itself killed Yahoo as the default internet ‚Äústart page‚Äù practically overnight. That‚Äôs *how* Google became Google.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 05:06:29'] No one is cancelling Netflix though and they are entrenched globally. They are the only company making money from streaming. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good stock but they aren‚Äôt really going anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 05:17:20'] I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.However today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.Middle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.Netflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. I think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 06:03:41'] It's even worse than you lay out.  NFLX debt and content obligations are so much more crippling than most realize.  And their debt is all rolling over into a terrible credit environment.  Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  They hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming "profitability" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.They're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 11:15:46'] >It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.It's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)You cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)Also, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).Their gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. TLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies.

Momentum for building out the PS5 ecosystem is growing, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said on a call after the earnings Thursday, waving off concerns about a demand lull for the two-year-old console.\n\nSony also hiked its operating profit forecast to 1.18 trillion ($9.2 billion) from 1.16 trillion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 05:31:52'] I don't think Microsoft really cares as much as Sony to be honest. I mean they obviously want to make more money from Xbox, but like, gaming is just a tad under 50% of Sony's revenue, whereas it's like 10% of Microsoft's revenue. Microsoft has far greater ambitions. Plus as others have pointed out, the Xbox really is just a segue device into getting a proper PC, or a PC-lite way of gaming for Microsoft's ecosystem. Sony has no equivalent whatsoever.I am more than thrilled for Sony to be excelling in the console gaming space, but it's not really an apples to apples comparison against Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 22:25:25'] I think that Microsoft moving most of its first party games to PC compatibility has something to do with this. I I was an Xbox guy since the 360 came out but once the exclusives like forza made their way over to PC I had no reason to get an xbox anymore. I got a ps5 this generation because the first party games are so good and you couldn‚Äôt get them on PC (I‚Äôm aware that Sony has started porting some of their exclusives to PC, but it‚Äôs usually a while after it comes out on the console)

Actually three years of gamepass unlimited is cheaper if going the Turkish route.If Xbox keeps adding value to their subscription then I think they'll get more market share especially if they can market it to the casual gamer crowd. Never would I have thought a few years ago I'd be buying an Xbox instead of PS5.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 02:25:04'] The Xbox is increasingly just a non-fuss, ready-to-use gaming PC; it‚Äôs a great branding piece for Microsoft‚Äôs gaming division and ultimately a fantastic entry point. However, it seems like Microsoft has long-been focussed on finding value in a different part of the tech stack. They‚Äôre buying developers and running studios, they‚Äôre hosting services, and they‚Äôre turning a lot of ‚ÄúXbox Live‚Äù into a cross-platform service too. I think that it‚Äôs somewhat fair to suggest that Sony and Microsoft don‚Äôt compete as much as they used to. These days, they are well differentiated. They‚Äôre not as well differentiated as Nintendo (it‚Äôs very hard to be, Nintendo is such a niche), for example, but they have increasingly different game offerings, catering to different gamers, with different needs.

Xbox is having a rough go due to lack of software to push their machine but with no 1st party games on the horizon (no pun intended) 19 million is ambitious on Sony's part. If Hogwarts Legacy doesn't suck that will help a bit, but a pretty barren summer (unless some major drops during a direct or E3) and light fall must indicate a slim model or price drop soon. Sony definitely needs to sell consoles as the FX9 and camera dept. are going to take a hit despite the quality of product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:23:34'] As an investor who‚Äôs niche is the video game industry the best bets are, in my opinion, Tencent and Nintendo.

Microsoft are not good in either hardware or game development (Xbox is a very distant third to Japan‚Äôs offerings) and most studios they have acquired have gone drastically downhill.

For one thing Apple is only about 15% or the mobile OS market worldwide, so the impact shouldn't be that painful. For two FB actually lost active users, which IMHO is a much much bigger issue for a growth company and its valuation.One thing is for sure though: Google was smart building Android and Chrome. This allows them to not let other companies pull the rug under their advertising feet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 03:25:08'] Honestly, I don't think Apple's privacy change is a huge headwind, it's just a temporary set back so long as they can continue to grow. The problem I have is will they continue to grow? I get that DAU is likely down this quarter because of the pandemic, but if their active user growth is stalling or dropping that's going to put significant pressure on their growth going forward. In previous years there seemed to be to a lot of competition in the social media space and people have been concerned about user growth for a while, but competition really seems to have picked up in recent years and it's to the point now where a lot of people I know don't use any FB products to connect with friends and family anymore, especially among younger demographics.If FB reports a decline in DAU for another quarter or two, they're done imo. The stock isn't going to recover from that and there isn't any obvious reason to expect DAU trends to change significantly in the near future. At best your looking at stagnating growth of their core products, and the metaverse at this point is just a moonshot which I'm personally not convinced of.Who knows with FB though... It's not like this is the first time people have worried about FB's user growth. I also think the stock is very cheap right now and the market is massively overreacting with a 20% drop. I don't think it's a bad buy, but I also don't think the long-term future is that bright for them.

Our budget isn‚Äôt being cut though, so google, snap, and tiktok are all seeing much bigger investment on our end (since our efficiency is way better on those platforms). Could just be specific to my company, but I feel somewhat bullish for other platforms with user growth since those ad dollars are gonna find somewhere else to go.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 08:15:16'] I really wonder if this will be a sign of worse things to come for Facebook. As impressive as their user numbers are, social media will always be a market with headwinds towards actually making money from those users.Add that to the fact that less and less of the younger generations use Facebook in favor of whatever the new hotness is, and it's possible it's dominance will start to fade.That goes double if their metaverse initiatives don't pick up steam.  I don't think it's add money from users can get much higher so metaverse is one of it's only real growth opportunities, and it remains to be seen whether anyone will actually give a shit about it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:21:09'] A couple things to point on why the stock does well. For one people are holding to their cars for longer. [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html)This means the need for autoparts will be higher. Since in theory a new car will not need as much maintaince. In fact, that article came out in 2015, if you look at their revenue growth:[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/)It's pretty solid. Nothing crazy, but they are still growing like 7%ish a year. You'll notice another import factor, the number in 2020. During the pandemic, the supply chain wrecked the new car market. This has a ripple effect. It means people will continue to hold onto used cars, but also this impacts the car rental market. Since they were holding onto used cars for longer, there as more demand for autoparts. This is because of the way warranties work on cars. You usually get 3 years or X amount of miles for full coverage. So it's in the advantage of rental car companies to buy new and sell used.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 09:48:45'] GOOG is outperforming SPY over the past 5 years so I don't think shareholders are exactly getting fucked by the company
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:39:01'] Lol you‚Äôre calling a company a villain for compensating its employees?    Company‚Äôs paying the employees to do the work that makes the money is ‚Äútransferring‚Äù it from the shareholders that do none of the work?  Lol you are out of touch with reality.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 09:51:39'] So how do you think faang companies can attract top talent without giving out stock compensation? If anything stock comp helps companies cash flow and operating expenses..stock compensation is part of employees tc and not free giveaway...there is also a vesting period so employees have a incentive to stay with the company and grow the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:11:38'] Isn't this exactly what millennials and Gen-Z employees are looking for? Yes, they want to be paid well, but they also would like to have an interest in the company's success. I can think of no better way to incentive employees to care than this.  Not only does this not make Google a "villain", it makes them smart and increases the likelihood of retaining their employees who help make Google what it is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 10:23:29'] It's part of the employee compensation. They can give cash directly with which the employee can buy anything including stocks or they can slowly vest GOOG stocks. why are you crying over a moot point?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 09:06:05'] What's even worse is the companies that are not profitable like Sofi and Draftkings having massive SBC at the expense of shareholders.Because using the public as an ATM is more important than running a business well.

Like lowering dividend payments?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:37:57'] Small rant: RSUs are awful.1.	They're taxed at vesting time via a 22% auto-withholding minimum. The state gets its cut too, and in CA, this is 10%. So you get at most 68% of the shares from your grant.2.	The vested shares are taxed as ordinary income, and that is levied on the day's value of the shares at vesting time, not their original grant value. So you are essentially paying ordinary income tax on unrealized capital gains.3.	This sucks because companies now grant you a dollar amount of shares, not a number of shares.  And they pick the price for those shares. So in a growing economy, your yearly grant means fewer and fewer shares that are taxed more.4.	On top of this, you have to hold on to those shares for a year to get long-term capital gain status.Give me options any day. RSUs are a fucking tax nightmare. Or even better just pay me cash and let me buy in via an ESPP.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 13:02:32'] The way SBC is discussed around here it's like people believe this isn't known information or something. Everyone is adjusting for this already.And while I won't get into it here, the idea that SBC is universally bad is narrow-minded. What's important is that SBC is done appropriately. Same thing applies to buy backs - they're not universally good. As a shareholder you shouldn't want a company like GOOG blindly buying back a load of it's stock because as an innovative tech company they should have better use of that capital. I actually think for fast growing tech companies SBC is a great way to secure talent and honestly I think employees having the option to be paid in stock is something more companies should practise anyway.But whatever your thoughts are on SBC to put this in perspective over the last 10 years GOOG has grown their top and bottom line by more than 550%. 12.8% dilution over that period is so insignificant that it would be within the margin of error of any DCF model.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:45:11'] What‚Äôs the problem? Outstanding shares shrank, talent was compensated, company does well. It‚Äôs not like they forced anyone to sell; they bought shares on the secondary market and gave them to employees (put them back in the secondary market).Maybe work for them if you want those shares lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 13:25:35'] This is how public companies (vast majority not all) compensate their executives.  All the information is available in public filings.  If the company had done very poorly, many of those options wouldn't have value at expiration and then the dilution would have been less.  Surely you aren't suggesting that is the preferred outcome?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 15:51:34'] I feel like this is what goes on in the minds of people who cheer on extreme baseless rate hikes. This guy seems disgruntled that Google is compensating its employees well. Good for them!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:16:19'] Meta and Google are nothing as far as SBC is concerned. Garbage company Palantir pays crazy hair magikarp  $6B at expense of shareholders. That company which has never made a cent in profit over 17 years became private only to provide its executives golden parachutes.  It has like 2B outstanding shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:36:40'] Good?  My whole life I‚Äôve heard that the concept of protecting shareholder value has basically been equivalent to the devil. Every evil thing a company ever does is blamed on protecting the shareholders .Treating employees well has always been considered morally good.It‚Äôs good, that they value employees more than shareholders who contribute nothing to the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 17:09:29'] To use a metaphor, it can be thought of as filling a bucket with water, only to have a hole at the bottom that drains the water out just as quickly. Imagine that the bucket represents a company's share count, and the water represents the value of those shares. The company may be using its cash to purchase shares from the market in an effort to boost the value of the bucket (share price). the issuance of new shares to employees as via their compensation is the hole at the bottom of the bucket, constantly replenishing the supply of shares and diluting the value of existing holdings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:49:45'] This post is why good companies die. Prioritizing stockholders does nothing for the fundamental value of the companydont give employees stock.... company loses in attracting top talent... company loses a more important resource to its value
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:56:08'] I‚Äôd rather companies pay their workers. You know, the people who actually do the work and give their lives to the company. Every public company should be required to issue employees stock like Meta and Google.And most employees aren‚Äôt millionaires.What kind of fucked up system are you aspiring to?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:01:40'] This is actually good. If you are basing this off 10 years. Share count is still down.Revenue is probably 10x now.Not like they are doing what Apple does since 2017 and doing huge buybacks yearly.Alphabet could do that and shrink the count.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:48:41'] As a long term investor why would someone care about this. If they continue at that pace in a just a decade over 10% of their total shares would be reduced which is really good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:49:35'] What a bunch of villains, trying to compensate their employees at the expense of investors‚Ä¶Keep looking at things like they exist in a vacuum - companies CHOOSE stock based compensation, offset by share repurchases, because it‚Äôs a net win over all cash compensation because of americas tax system and how it favors corporations doing exactly this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:45:57'] Meta and Google are *adtech* companies (almost entire revenue is from running ads), so their users are not their paying customers and they are not selling their product to their users who vote by paying for it. This creates a cognitive dissonance, and hence they spend the money like that.On the contrary, Apple and Amazon and Tesla and Nvidia and Microsoft and Netflix and other big tech companies, all create some product and earn money from consumers who pay to use it. So they have to *justify* every dollar spent, including on high compensation for employees.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 11:17:26'] If it gets them the talent they need and the rest goes into investment in the company id prefer that over empty buybacks. Or else they end up dealing with consequences like intel is currently.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:02:47'] It really doesn't matter if they're issuing it back out to their employees...1) If a company is buying back their own stock they are betting on themselves.  They're saying the current price is a better investment of capital than spending on growth projects they believe will return Last to their bottomline.2) If a company issues stocks as incentive packages they are building a common measurement ground of success between public shareholders and employees.Having said all this, Pichai is running Google into the ground, IMO.  Dudes a hack.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 12:29:11'] >shareholders to employees in their monetization of stock-based comp over the past ten years.The employees are shareholders. Management are shareholders. Anything they do to the stock value directly impacts their own wealth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 09:14:22'] Can set these guys with Amazon. Another company that can‚Äôt stop printing shares. At least google isn‚Äôt a cash furnace like Amazon is.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 13:29:13'] People in the comments are saying that you need to pay this to keep top talent and they may be right but as an investor is that the best company to invest in?   When they start buying back shares (for real) or pay dividends won't the moat start to disappear?  I like Goog but there are others like PLTR which just seem to be stock based comp as a service company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 15:46:40'] The buybacks may have initially propped up and then slowed down the fall in price of Google, Apple, etc., but buybacks are not responsible for their falling prices.  Let us not displace our frustration with falling share prices to the buyback schemes, although they are unhealthy, being a form of wash trading that masks the true value of the shares, and defeats the price discovery function of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 15:56:07'] There are tons of companies where this is a totally valid critique, where the company is losing money and they are giving so much comp in the form of equity to be able to present themselves as adjusted EBITDA positive or Cash Flow positive, and share count os going through the roof.That might have even been a fair critique of Google 15 years ago.But it‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs happening at this company now. Google is wildly profitable, and they like equity comp because it aligns incentives, gives management better control over timing of cash outlays for discretionary buybacks rather than mandatory cash comp, and it is preferred by employees.If the argument is that employees are being paid too much on an all on basis, I guess we can have that conversation. But Google is a bad poster child for the argument that SBC is out of control and misleading investors.Edit: typo corrected shareholders->employees

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 17:44:59'] I think we need to differentiate a bit here.A middle manager in a FAANG company could well be the CEO or another C-level exec of an SMB.As others have mentioned stock compensation for employees have positive effects on employees. Where I am as skeptical as you are OP, is if a large firm does need that many mid-level execs that are millionaires? And how much stock compensation should be paid out?As for reducing the amount of mid-level execs, this may be attainable by having a flatter hierarchy, ideally having almost no hierarchy at all (e.g. holocracy or the Spotify Model).As for reducing the stock compensation this can be done easily ‚Äî just stop giving out shares to your employees. However, these topshots are gonna get paid anyway. Also even if a topshot seems overpaid, it might still be worth keeping them employed since if they‚Äòre working for you, they are not working for your competitor which may hurt them even more in this global war for talents.So instead of giving them stocks, you‚Äòll pay them more money directly which increases your salary spending and in turn reduces your profits, therefore reducing dividends and/or the value of a share.To summarise, we would need to know how the stock price is affected in relation to dilution versus salary spending.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 17:47:23'] This is exactly why I want dividends instead of buybacks. Buybacks are theoretical returns imo, dividends are real
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 17:57:22'] Yeah man you honestly sound a little selfish. Corporations clearly already favor shareholders over workers a lot of the time. Complaining about compensating people actually working so you can sit and collect is very narrow minded.

How many net new employees? Is majority of new shares going to senior executives and board members or mid level folks? Are they forgoing business expansion/operations or is there not much to do with cash? How much debt do they have and how is it laddered?

When you talk about a 4-point to 5-point decel in Azure, that‚Äôs off of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? Thank you.>Amy Hood>It‚Äôs all ‚Äì Karl, let me just ‚Äì the first half of your question, give me a second. [pauses]. On the second half of your question, which is the guide of the exit rate ‚Äì it‚Äôs off the exit rate on Azure of four points to five points, just to make sure that is clearSo their guide down is not from 38%, it‚Äôs baselined to 35%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 15:34:01'] This is the reason why people need to look at ERs and listen to earning calls.MSFT actually skewed their numbers.When did they announce the layoffs? Mid January, where did they throw the severance expense? Previous quarter (the one they just reported) lmao.Literally no one talked about this.And even with this their guidance for the quarter was lower than analysts expected.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 17:00:49'] I'm very bullish on MSFT but I'm not getting the AH reaction. Frankly, I don't think the entire market has a clue what's going on so far this year.This is a pretty objectively bad set of results. Not just for MSFT, although 39% drop in OEM rev is an eye opener. But if even Microsoft's margins are being squeezed and cloud guidance is nosediving I think any chance of a soft landing that was left just ticked down to 0.Loading up on IG credit, treasuries. Don't think any equities are going to be the place to hide this first half.

Let 'em hold the bags now.  Nothing wrong with MSFT company or management.  It just absorbed so much easy money from past quantitative easings, it is still soaked with easy money.  But if every company finds an excuse to hang on to the soak, this undeserved "wealth effect" will cause inflation to last a lot longer, and if the market pops, inflation will too.  The Fed has been dragging its feet too long and this is causing so many bear rallies which drag out inflation even longer.  The Fed needs to bump up the feds funds rate by 0.5% at the least.  When to stop?  When the headline inflation rate is down to 2.0%.  Like, when do you take your foot off the brakes of a car that is headed toward a  wall?  When it stops moving forward.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:48:16'] Two months prior to the introduction of the Ipod, I bought 1,000 shares of AAPL at $18.  Following the "pigs get slaughtered" mantra, I sold it not long after the Ipod came out for $25 a share.  A gain of 38%.  I was pleased with myself.  IF I had held those shares that I really did not need to sell, and sold primarily because of that mantra,  they would be worth $7,560,000 dollars today.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:22:32'] There's so much solid advice that contradicts each other.Don't get greedy. On the other hand take some risks when young.Let your winners run. On the other hand you should take profits.Don't time the market. On the other hand have cash for a correction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:20:32'] Sure have been a lot of posts lately talking about having AAPL in the 80‚Äôs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:59:52'] Hell, I‚Äôve got plenty of those myself. I owned AMD at 12. AMZN at 900. SHOP at 100. ETH at 100. Sold them each for barely any profit. I had GME at 420.69 (with a $40 basis) and didn‚Äôt sell. You make the best choices you can with the information you have, and try to learn from your mistakes.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 05:23:44'] This is a good post. I did a ton of homework on GameStop (before it became a movement) and put 1/5th of my overall portfolio in it. I had a strong conviction buy on my model that the company should be $40-50 once the holiday sales started along with the rapid e-commerce sale growth and growing cash pile.I got lucky with Reddit getting involved and taking it to 300+ which I sold my stake then, making me a millionaire. But it‚Äôs just funny that as the dust is settling, gme is holding right at $50. Which was where I originally thought it would go. That would have been a home run as my initial stake was $5.58/share. I averaged up over the months to $7.04. tl;dr trust your dd and take calculated risks. Also have an exit strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 08:44:49'] I don‚Äôt think he was a pig at all.The company was a partnership at that point not an llc and llp wasn‚Äôt a thing then. If it went bankrupt, he was personally on the hook for any losses, so the shares could in essence become negative on him. Woz and Steve had no assets but he did which made it even riskier for him since creditors would go after him in that case - they could take his house, etc. Practically it meant as a 10% owner he got 10% of the upside and 80 or 90% of the downside beyond assets.And, they were using some debt and taking some risks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:04:36'] Frankly I'd rather make compounding 20% reliably than worry about finding the next 1200% bagger. It's that mentality that's caused a lot of idiots around here to lose everything. You can say to do your DD and whatnot but I say that's ultimately a no true scotsman argument when this crowd(who you're addressing) is involved.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:23:26'] Honestly just give each investment you make a 5 year horizon rather than a few months. There is a difference in investors and traders. Investing is much easier and much more rewarding than trading in my opinion. Sure, I bought Amazon for $500 and sold it for $1000. Nice $500 profit per share. But if I held it, I would‚Äôve been happier. Investors get rewarded, traders often miss out a lot of growth that they can‚Äôt always account for. If you make a bad choice on a company, no need to panic sell after a month if you believe in it. Ride it out for at least a year and tax loss harvest if it is a loser.

But if this is money you can afford to lose, and you've truly put in the work on your DD...This is what I came here to say. If you can't afford to take the chance to see if the stock will rise, then obviously you need to take your profits and run. You're going to always leave money on the table.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:08:12'] I‚Äôve done well by setting an asset allocation. I always think of percentage exposures. Using AAPL as you example. If you want to have 10% exposure and it floats up to 12% by outperforming the remainder of your portfolio, sell a little and bring it back to target. Use the proceeds to buy the under weights.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:19:05'] I buy with the intentions of holding until my findings tell me otherwise. I‚Äôm not out for any specific number or time. It could be a week if I find something drastically south, it could be ten years, as long as it‚Äôs winning, i don‚Äôt see any reason to change based of some arbitrary number. It would be different with different intentions like swing trading or whatever, but I mostly do buy and holds on stocks I want for a long while.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 09:42:03'] Pigs: I had 500 shares of Tesla at $30~ and sold for around $5 profit. Let‚Äôs just say that 500 shares would be 2500 now at around $820 and I would not have to work. Did the same with Apple and Amazon about 20 years ago. At least I held Apple from $24 to $550 but it‚Äôs split like 2-3 times since then and that would be like $200-300k more than I made. Pretty much sucks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 10:59:57'] Not sure this example is really showing ‚Äúpigs get slaughtered‚Äù. When I think of that, I think of people chasing stocks that already popped because they think they‚Äôll go higher (tsla, GME, etc), or even holding something that grew 80% overnight, but then it flat for a year, losing money that could have been made on other investments in the meantime. It doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúsit an hold something just because you don‚Äôt need the money‚Äù. Sitting on something flat or growing too slow can be a loss. If you‚Äôre an active investor and you want to lock in profits to move on to the next play, selling at a profit makes sense so you can invest in something else. Always have an exit plan, but don‚Äôt be afraid to change that if you have data supporting the change.

They could develop a decent YouTube competitor with their Facebook watch. A stand-alone versi√≥n where youtubers can make extra money and content.Yet it‚Äôs kept somewhere inside Facebook along so many random services. Just like yahoo. They could have a Shopify like service that can tag along with affiliate links and server space.And that way see more data outside their Facebook app. Because that‚Äôs how google is still making money from ads.They tag multiple services and know where to get customers from all their services combined. So That‚Äôs my prediction. Facebook turning into yahoo. Where at one point it was seen as a huge futuristic company to turn out to be a joke.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 07:38:33'] Oh yeah and how about Apple charging people 100% more for their phones? They are both trying to get their hands on as much money as they get away with. Apple is just as bad as meta.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 07:31:58'] Old man yells at cloud!Most people have no idea what the metaverse is or is going to be.  Talk to the kids out there and find out what they think.  Does anyone remember explaining the internet to their parents and them shaking their heads?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 04:26:33'] Apple is pretty much considered a safe-haven asset (Personally I would add MSFT as well). They are growth and have insane FCF with a decent dividend and constant share buybacks. They work in every environment. I somewhat agree with a comment on CNBC yesterday about Apple being a sort of bond with growth potential.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 08:12:41'] Stocks with high PE ratios are generally the first the get crushed before they hit any kind of resistance. Right now it‚Äôs especially important to invest in balance sheet stocks rather than forward looking revenue growth. Not telling you what to do but it‚Äôs been a great run and there is nothing wrong with taking money off the table. Consider this mind blowing stat. If Apple‚Äôs cash balance was looked at as it‚Äôs own company it would be top 15 in terms of market cap on the S&P 500. Fucking crazy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-30 23:31:52'] One day's worth of trading data doesn't tell you anything.If Apple had been up 3% vs -1% of peers over the last 12 months, then yes, one might be able to put together a credible hypothesis.Nobody can tell you shit based off one day's trading data. Random walks and/or too much noise to draw any reliable conclusions (e.g. markets are irrational in the short run and efficient in the long)
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 04:52:41'] Its Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 09:50:40'] Apple stock has been tracking up very slowly past yr compared to others. They saw all the fairy dust EV co we‚Äôre getting on stock market and decided to sprinkle that dust on their turd too, by announcing plans of intention to get into ev game and behold their stock jumped too immediately
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-30 13:48:28'] First day here, huh?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-30 20:13:01'] I think it‚Äôs because the SpaceEx IPO was talked about this week and Apple owns a stake in SpaceEx. It‚Äôs easier to buy shares at $150 than shares that are currently valued at $600 pre IPO and may easily go to $1200 or more thereafter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-30 20:51:16'] It‚Äôs Apple!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-30 21:36:28'] Apple is seen as a safe bet in uncertain times. You may lose money if you buy it overvalued (which I think it is); but on a long enough time youll make that money back. For deep pockets with nowhere better to park cash, its a good buy

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 03:40:31'] Apple has the potential of entering EV market and Advertising business and also the Metaverse. Plus they are sitting on billions of cash; ready to invest and ready to purchase any small innovative company. I dont care about interest rate changes as i dont think they will affect apple as much as other companies as its not heavily indebted and does not need to borrow money to invest. The only risk associated with the company i see on regulatory/antitrust side but other than that Apple and Nvda are my top picks above everything and anything else.Apple saved my portfolio yesterday; this has more than motivated me not only to buy more apple stocks but more apple products as well
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 04:13:26'] People keep buying iphones and watches. Have to buy a new one every 2 yrs as the devices are made to expire. Pretty brilliant. We need the devices and no competitor is close to being as ‚Äòcool‚Äô for college kids and becky. Apple is like a bank account on steroids. Oh they are also trying to get into the EV business.Ive prob got 20% of my portfolio in Apple and its prob tripled since I put it there. And I just bought the new iphone 13 pro and 2 watch 7s

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 22:42:06'] From that list, GOOGL is the only one I would personally buy today.ETFs are always the better/safer play, yes. And no, you shouldn't put all in one stock, never.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 00:09:11'] I understand that everybody is excited about NVDAs future, but I cannot see how anybody can see the price as reasonable. They have a P/E of 155, P/S of 25. Their margin are ok, but won't grow endlessly, as they need high investments to keep their edge.They are mature and dominate their market, so the only source of growth would be market expansion. Which means the market has to grow by a factor of 10 for them to be reasonably priced at the same margin.So I would ask anybody investing in NVDA 2 questions:1. which price do would you consider a fair value?2. What is your expected case scenario for NVDA to make reasonable earnings according to their price?I just stay away from this.i consider it super high risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:54:14'] Tech returns in the past are no guarantee of future performance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:24:28'] Asking Reddit for stock advice isn't too great of a starting point lol. You'd be better off buying something like qqq until you get a good reason to buy single stocks.Edit: also unless you're doing crazy high volume, QQQM is cheaper.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 23:40:57'] Honestly unless you really understand the software industry or if you work in it I wouldn‚Äôt invest in Saas companies. I‚Äôm not saying they are bad or good just a heads up really high valuations with completion everywhere including big tech. Nvda is one I know but is pretty expensive right now I would probably pass but that‚Äôs up to you to decide what you are comfortable with. I also own google
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 19:57:02'] My personal view on listed stocks:  - GOOGL: no.1 pick for next bullmarket- NVDA: too expensive rn- datadog: no idea- cloudflare/crowdstrike: risky plays, vague ideaFor serious investment:  - DCA into SP500 or broader (outside US/less tech heavy) over ~2 years, then forget about it  - Or Bonds: long running and reallocate into stocks if rates go down

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 21:40:43'] I'd put at least half in QQQ and the rest in GOOGL and NVDIA... but, Nvidia has had such a runup it's hard to recommend now.. maybe wait for a pullback
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 23:43:40'] Personally? I recommend avoiding spy and do VOO instead. Identical return and cheaper expense ratio. If you have a retirement I recommend Schwab s&p 500 mutual fund as it has nearly the lowest expense ratio out there. Also I always throw this in their for the drip program but KO but don‚Äôt expect crazy returns but expect good returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 00:27:32'] Dont buy stocks. Sell puts instead to get a discount. I think QQQ is better imo. No need to worry about any one stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 08:14:20'] I‚Äôd recommend diversifying and hold 5+.  Look at AMD, asml/lrcx, in place of nvidia I like msft more than google due to leadershipShould have something in oil/gas Like panw over crowdGet a bank like gs or JPM Maybe ibb or Lilly

My best performing and worst performing stock happens to be Tesla which has way too much volatility. Today Elon says this, next day something caused -7% fall.  I reduced my position and will do so soon. I once held MSFT and INTC long ago, thinking like you. Bought around 2000. It took MSFT 16 years to recover.  With INTC I did not know they had more Pentium chips in the warehouse could not sell never disclosed.   Today not profitable again, live on government subsidized grant not by itself.

Well right now both are wrong and we are creating a giant balance the past months, waiting for something to happen. Be patient stay in cash and if we see some real actually strength buy into it.

The "recession" will never be made public until it's already happening (look at 2008-10) and there's seemingly no end to the free money, despite the fed raising rates little by little.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 04:15:07'] \> And when people see inflation in the 10-20% range, I doubt we‚Äôll see people buying the dips.You understand inflation is good for nominal equity valuations, right? The reason inflation is considered bad in regards to equities is because it means higher rights and recession risk.Low rates and high inflation is what caused the rally in 2021.  \> Crash the markets and reset the entire financial system.The Fed doesn't want a crash. Crashes cause unnecessary economic harm. What they want to see a gradual slowdown in demand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 03:40:49'] It's so funny when people openly admit they see stocks just as gains instead of owning a business. Why wouldn't you buy stocks and own something with actual worth? A good business will increase prices and it's earnings will keep up with inflation. Compared to your "savings" in an account which will never be able to keep up with inflation. There are businesses out there that you can buy below their book value!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 00:03:46'] Markets don‚Äôt dictate inflation, personal spending habits and corporate pricing do. The question is if those rich enough to dictate the pricing will treat money like an NFT or if they will be more ambitious and cause the collapse.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 03:17:50'] **The proper thing to do is let those banks fail and control inflation. However, it seems they might pause rate hikes and let inflation continue to be high for the sake of profits/greed.**&#x200B;In case you have not figured it out already, the leaders in this country obsess over profits and money. Not doing the "right things". So while the right thing is to lower inflation, they will choose money. Every time.

For what it's worth I am holding leap puts and not going long anything at the moment but the FED has much more control than you think. Just look at FRC today and do you need to be reminded of the unnatural V-shaped recovery following COVID ? That was also the Fed's doing. They could drag this out as long as they want. I'm thinking 4-5 years easily. My thesis might have been correct but my puts will still expire worthless. Everything's a gamble.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 08:18:05'] The economy is strong,  You have to let inflation run it's course.  it's worldwide inflation due to the pandemic plus inflation from wage increases to  lower paid workers.   If raising rates solved inflation it would be going down now and they would not need to raid rates every month.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 09:38:24'] That is his job to regulate interest rate. The only tool Feds got. Our job is have plan B and C ready if he misses something.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 11:47:32'] Because the market looks for any excuse to be bullish?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 18:06:09'] but that is assuming we are experiencing normal "inflation" (too many dollars chasing to few goods.)  This is not the case as proven by the record profits of the oligarchs who are raising prices whether demand goes up or not and creating false supply shortages.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:09:34'] UNHUnited Health is a steady rocket ship. Check out the chart since about 2008. It‚Äôs not a sexy stock but it‚Äôs a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here‚Äôs why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically ‚Äúprice fixing‚Äù. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.How do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that‚Äôs not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we‚Äôre forced into annual increases no matter what.The health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences‚Ä¶ low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. Just food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation‚Ä¶ lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:05:32'] United Microelectronics (UMC) will see some short-term pain, but already trade at a discount and are well-positioned and growing in automotive and communications.With the capacity to ship 10 million wafers a year, a relatively bulletproof balance sheet, a likely to be fat dividend (if they return the same % of earnings as they did last year it'll be ~10% yield), and additional capacity coming online in Taiwan as well as Singapore over the next couple of years I really like their odds of returning to strong growth in the medium term. That being said I do intend to wait for another dip before adding again since I have a decent chunk already and 1H23 looks pretty shaky.

Intel is dropping their prices, and most likely they going to scale back their new Ohio Fab.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 03:37:41'] Certain demands will decline possibly on consumer sides.Enterprise wise... There's still device shortages. A lot still have months lead time to order minus the really big stuff that usually isn't replaced or purchased as often. Think servers etc that start @ 40-50k - 500k. (But then even some of those are still back ordered depending on the company.)But I think every ones forecasting is now all F'ed. Because forecasting random once every few decades events ain't easy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 11:16:43'] There is also a report that Apple shipped 5-10% more iPhones than expected last quarter, so the truth is somewhere between, most likely.   Though everyone is expecting a lousy quarter and it probably will be, any hint of getting past this by AAPL will send the stock up quite  bit very quickly. Plus, unless you believe Putin will wage war forever even without ammo or soldiers left, and the Fed will continue raising rates long after the economy has slowed down,  this is the time to BUY.  Everything except cryptos or TSLA, the latter because of its ultra high PE which is not justified.To me, the real golden goose is AAPL. My Colombian girlfriend's iphone died yesterday and boy did she panic. "I spend my whole life on that phone, I run my business on that phone, I need a new one now, please send $800". Then, as I queried her about fixing her old iPhone she ignored me and just bought a new one on credit for the asking price. She couldn't bear to be without it even for a few hours. Therefore, multiple her by a billion and contemplate the reality of today's world.    Besides basic food and survival, the iPhone is the top priority. I have seen homeless people with iPhones. In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about "what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 13:49:31'] TSMC is still slammed as is Intel.My girlfriend works at Intel here in Hillsboro and can literally contact a recruiter at any point to get someone hired almost on the spot, through one of their contractor services. No doubt huge contracts being talked about here with AMD, Apple etc... But there are other sectors like the car market where chips are still in short supply and it should be noted the orders from the big graphics companies were reduced not cancelled.

But Google put up three times the growth rate!!Plus Google just has a massive runway to work with to keep it going.People forget that Google is 1/2 the age of Apple and Microsoft.It is mind blowing that Google is now a $250 billion dollar business and last quarter grew at over 30% !!!So much for the law of large numbers.The big difference is that these companies have a ton of different avenues to find growth when they need it.   Google for example still gives away a lot of stuff.   Look at Android.  Over a billion devices activated each year and Google does not charge a cent.  Plus there is basically no competition on the lower and mid range as Apple is priced far higher.So Google could add a nominal Android license fee and generate billions in new profits.  There would be almost zero additional expense.  So just charging $10 license would not change sales and would add $10 billion of new profits for Google.    Or Google could end the blocking of ads on YouTube if they wanted to.  YouTube TV you can NOT block ads.   So Google could kill the ad blockers if they wanted to with YT.  There is plenty of other examples with the three.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 22:49:27'] Earning miss alone will not cause a big drop. Meta and Paypal huge drop was due to many other factors.The main reason was due weak forward earning guidance. People have already mentioned in other posts, when a company show slowing in growth, the valuation of the company will get reassessed and get traded at a lower P/E. Just look at Intel, ViacomCBS, AT&T, Wish etc. They trade at low P/E because people don't expect to see growth.If Apple, Microsoft, Google missed on earning, but show good growth, they will be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 05:06:18'] Comparing those companies to Meta isn't a true comparison. No one (or at least veeeery few) relies on Facebook for work.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 20:32:10'] Facebook is fundamentally different in that they rely on platforms that they do not own to make most of their revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 02:41:08'] I personally think Microsoft and Apple are overvalued. Let me preface it with that. A stock‚Äôs ‚Äúreaction‚Äù on earnings is all about the guidance. If there‚Äôs any thought about growth slowing,Investors are going to discount future cash flows  at a higher rate or reduce future cash flows. That‚Äôs all stock is is claims in future cash flows. So Apple and Microsoft are valued right now at a very low discount rate (low risk) of future cash flows. Which is actually the most risky scenario possible. If I look at FB trading at 18x this whats cash flows there is MUCH less risk because what is my downside? 25%? But if I buy Apple it‚Äôs trading at 30x this year‚Äôs earnings. I see that as way more risky.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:20:17'] Earnings miss is less important than forward guidance in key growth areas.An earnings miss can help inform/provide context about future guidance, but it's not the miss per se that would send these stocks crashing.  Most of their value is in their rapid growth, and if that growth really slows down then their valuation would eventually have to come down to being more like a value company, meaning at around half their current price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:05:33'] They've missed before, in a 'normal' market they dip for a few weeks and bounce back - as you're seeing now they've been pretty resillient relative to the broader index.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 07:59:14'] I used to work in investment banking on Leveraged buyouts. We used Debt / EBITDA as our leverage metric. <3x D/E was fine3-5x D/E was in the risky territory'>5x we would not invest inThat's under the assumption that most corporate term loans are on a 10 year amortization schedule. So the main question is "how many years would it take for this company pay off it's debt if 100% of it's operating cash flows went to debt service."
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 06:07:51'] Check the interest coverage ratio if you want to get a rough idea of the debt position.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 05:24:28'] Depends on the company.  For example, with banks, debt is their product which is a lot of the reason their balance sheets are challenging to interpret using traditional methods.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 05:10:34'] is the company able to service the debt?(pay interest so debt does not increase)
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 08:52:45'] A few ratios I‚Äôd pay attention to:Debt/Equity (you pointed this out)Debt/EBITDA: not sure what appropriate ranges are, but I‚Äôd view anything over 4x to be fairly leveraged. Depending on industry.Interest Coverage Ratio: if this slims, that points to over leveraging.Otherwise, profit ratios can be helpful too. If a company has slim profit margins and high leverage, that implies lots of risk.Hopefully this is helpful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 06:34:27'] Interest coverage and leverage ratio (debt to ebitda) are the most common ways it's done.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 07:24:00'] I like using debt to free cash flow.. Shows how easily the company can service their debt. Just have to find a multiple that you are comfortable with. Theoretically the multiple should go down the higher interest rates, but I think it's better to find a single multiple that is conservative in both high and low interest rate environments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 05:25:59'] Previous results don‚Äôt guarantee future results so if a company is too leveraged to the point where any meaningful downturn in their profitability (recession, change in consumer taste, etc) puts them at risk of defaulting on their debt‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a high level of debtEach sector typically operates in a different way so there‚Äôs no magic ratio aside from looking at their interest expense, ability payoff debt without refinancing it and their cash flows
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 06:53:28'] Is is dependent on the business model. Companies that have secured revenues and valuable assets are able to borrow more than companies that can't. You can really only compare to similar companies of you are trying to find out if they have too much debt.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 08:46:11'] Some companies like real estate or prison companies have long term contracts guaranteeing revenue so they can take on more debt relative to operating cash flow.But most companies don't have such guaranteed contacts so they can carry smaller debt loads relative to operating cash flow.Distressed companies have high debt to cash flow ratios should be avoided because most can't pull out of that death spiral.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 20:58:39'] High level of debt in a company....like when GM had to take their private jets to ask the government for a bail out? Or do you mean like when all the investment banks destroyed everyone's retirement savings, mortgages, and careers and no one saw a day in jail? I think debt is not the hard fast concept it once was. For example, if you are too big to fail, you can get as much debt as you like, and just dump it on the taxpayer. If you are a taxpayer, you can get all the debt you like and dump it on your kids, grand kids, and great grand kids. Hope this cleared things up for you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 14:05:04'] I wonder why all these media companies decided to build their own streaming services, that lose money mind you, rather than license their content to Netflix like the good old days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 21:19:19'] Can anyone, anyone in the world, explain the differences between the streaming channels: NBC, Peacock & Paramount+?  For the life of me I can't find a pattern as to what shows are on which. Any given show might be on zero through all three. And each channel has different levels. WTF! It's insanity. What am I missing? What's the pattern?These guys seem only to know how to confuse the heck out of me. If it weren't for my wife, who can't figure it out either, but has more patience than me, we wouldn't have any of those channels. And I'm being nice, there are a hell of a lot more than the three streaming channels that fall under the NBC, or whatever bullshit umbrella it is. Imagine if Netflix had 5 channels and spread shows and movies randomly over the channels. That's what these NBC idiots seem to be doing.

POST_TEXT: b"It seems like the stocks which consistently outperform the overall market are in new mediums. The most recent would be in tech stocks with Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Google.

Or maybe there will be a bubble which pops like in 2000 with tech overall.\n\nI don;t know if Facebook would be worth buying into since they're kinda leading the charge into virtual reality, even if they'll probably be overtaken by another company which does it better as precedent has shown us."

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 01:10:15'] I would say that MR has a greater chance than VR. Especially if the hardware for it becomes smaller and they tweak some things that can easily be tweaked.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 02:20:47'] I think AR/MR are investment opportunities on a 10 Year horizon. If Apple releases working AR glasses at scale it could change the landscape like the iPhone did when it first came out. If you think about it we spend a lotof time looking down into our phones, which is not really natural or even good in most situations. Picking the right stocks and investments in the area is another story. I suppose infrastructure companies with more verticals like Nvidia, Unity, Apple etc is more safe. Virtual Reality to me seems more like an enhancement for gaming, but who knows. I really like the new PlayStation VR set. Hated Horizon World. Virtual Worlds is interesting, thinking Roblox and the way the get brands like Nike and Gucci to invest in their platform, and support them in generating revenue and awareness. It is a nice supplement to traditional online marketing reaching a younger demographic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 00:12:52'] The modern era of VR has been going for a few years now and hasn't moved out of its niche. The lack of groundbreaking products from Meta shows that they can't work out what to do with it. Not a very exciting area...though maybe Apple reignites it later this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 04:33:43'] Nope, it is a gimmick that will never get from the ground. Only if the technology is convenient and adds value for most of the people it will become popular.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 11:06:54'] I unironically believe that VR/AR is going to obsolete laptops/monitors. Besides the weight, battery, heat, resolution, and ergonomics issues; the user experience is far better and the portability cannot be approximated.The issues above are not insurmountable, they are classic technology problems that have well-established academic fields and industry expertise. And so I think it is just a matter of time before phones and laptops get replaced with glasses.The question isn't whether AR/VR is the future, it is whether or not Facebook will be able to beat Apple in introducing this disruptive technology at a smartphone scale.

If I had to guess today, I‚Äôd look at Apple‚Äôs upcoming headset and the companies likely supplying parts for it. The problem is that it‚Äôs unlikely to materially affect Apple‚Äôs bottom line for years and they are notoriously hard on suppliers. Small vertical market niches might be a place to look, like headset software for surgeons or mechanics. Personally I‚Äôm planning on writing a VR game for the new headset but there‚Äôs a really good chance I‚Äôll be wasting my time and money.

Besides that, the NASDAQ went down 30% in 2022 and even after going down that much it was still up massively for the decade. So, the 30% down vision you have is still a bubble from when other people were screaming the same song over the last 30 years. Crashes aren't really crashes when they never crash down to levels seen in the prior crash. The NASDAQ is up so much since the 1990's it's crazy. All while having wars, shootings, and all the nonsense bears say will produce a crash. Wrong for too long equals wrong forever.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 07:45:36'] Apple's Services have always been a very controversial topic. I'm not a fan of looking at Apple for its services which have always been tied to is ecosystem. You need to look at Apple as a hardware provide first. Its services have always been secondary.The point is this: VR/MetaVerse. Do you think Apple is going to usher in the era of the metaverse? If yes, Apples is going to double if not multiples of this.

POST_TEXT: b"It should be obvious by now that GOOGL has a product problem. They have released quite  a lot of products only to fail to follow up on them and die out or have some other company come in and take the lead.\n\nThey are supposed to have some really smart people but they can't seem to turn these products into successful ones. \n\nYou can take a look at how many products and services they have released over the years only to miserably fail one after another ( www.killedbygoogle.com )\n\nThat said, Google has a pretty good record in the past (Gmail, search, maps, android etc) but they have stalled big time and haven't had any products that can make them a ton of money hence why I consider the company as a one trick pony one. I can't remember when was the last time they released something and gained momentum. Granted, you could just as easily say the same for APPL but they still put out products reminding people they are still very much relevant. When was the last time you got excited over a googl"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 06:20:54'] One extremely valuable asset that Google has is user data. Facebook was thought to have a few thousand data points per user, Google is thought to maintain MILLIONS of data points per user.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:41:10'] Google doesn‚Äôt have an innovation problem, they have a size problem.  Once you get a certain size it is very hard to ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù because most innovation is too small to bother with.  Google could come out with a billion a year product and that doesn‚Äôt even increase revenue 0.5%.  So the space innovation for them is really focusing on tens of billion a year opportunities.  That is the same innovation problem Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc has.  Most would consider Apple a very innovative company, but what was their last innovation?  Apple Watch (if you even consider that innovative)?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:00:32'] Google is a ‚Äúone trick pony‚ÄùTheir ‚Äúone trick‚Äù: Google Cloud, Google search, YouTube, Google Pixel, Google drive, gmail, Google maps,  android, Google play store, Google chrome, Google calendar/meet/classroom/authenticator/fitness/pay, YouTube Music
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:48:36'] Regarding all those failed products: trying and failing and killing products is part of the corporate philosophy of Google. Companies that always shoot for 100% success of every project can only play safe, thereby killing all innovation before it happens.So the fact that it has a big graveyard along with a market dominating position in key tech areas (search, maps, ad solutions, mobile os, free mail, browser, video platform, etc) is a feature of the company. The aspect that all of the market dominating platforms are dated and there is little new stuff is the problem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:09:42'] I hate the killedByGoogle narrative meaning that Google has a bleak future and is terribly ran. No. Google kills a product that clearly isn‚Äôt going to become a money machine. They cut their losses instead of wasting time and money on that product. A good example is how people on this forum think Google Cloud is going to get killed off in the near future (lol). It‚Äôs already bringing in $25B revenue annually. Google has 90% of the search market which gives them the best access to user data, along with phenomenal financials that allow them to dump billions of R&D into AI & ML research. 80% of their search money comes from 1st party tracking. Unless world governments suddenly decide that Google can‚Äôt hold user data and legislate their profitability away - the company will continue to do well. Cloud Computing TAM is projected to be $1.4T by 2030. Google has the talent and resources to maintain 3rd place. Even if they only scalp 10% of market share. That‚Äôs still $140B revenue, and 30% net margins mean $40B in profit. Search is already bringing in over $40B so Google is realistically looking at $80-100B+ profit by the end of the decade. Oh and YouTube TV is making successful moves in the cable space. They just landed NFL Sunday Ticket! And the stock is $1.1T? Easy buy. Google has grown revenue 20%+ on an annualized basis every year except for this year and the early 2010s. Search isn‚Äôt going away (unless chatGPT can be developed better in terms of functionality and accuracy). And Cloud + YouTube are very profitable segments. Cloud is the sector to watch for innovation
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:35:10'] > Google Cloud generated a total of $6.87 billion in revenue during its third quarter, representing an increase of 38 percent year over year. [Link](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/google-ceo-touts-priority-google-cloud-with-27-5b-run-rate)It trails Azure & AWS, yes (for now).  But it's growing its piece of a massive and still expanding pie.  I like GOOGL and am continually selling big CSP mostly hoping I get assigned.  You get a gigantic core biz w value and an additional growth segment in which they're investing huge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:05:06'] As someone pretty deep into the gaming space the failure of stadia is indicative of Google‚Äôs issues imo.The technology side was incredibly good and the service had a very attractive hook but it was held back by a very poor pricing structure and bad marketing which seems to be a running theme with Google. After it launched stadia was also very slow to expand its offering and seemed oblivious to the competing services in the space and it soon became obvious that stadia was not receiving a lot of support from Google.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:07:11'] I do partly agree, most of the things google has tried to do of late have either only partially worked or been killed. That said, the core business of search, android, and YouTube is still extremely profitable and they aren‚Äôt moving as the market leader any time soon. And it seems like they‚Äôre currently more focussed on those core areas than new innovations. Does this mean they‚Äôre in for a slow decline? Hard to say. Will they remain big and profitable for the next decade? Almost certainly. Is the stock over/under valued? I have no idea.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:47:18'] I wouldn‚Äôt bet against them , and I bet the ad revenue alone from YouTube will keep them alive longer than Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 07:57:05'] Are you looking for a bear case?I'd rather they push for as many projects as possible and pull from their failures and execution strategies.  Nearly all of their failed projects have resulted in positive improvements to other products through consolidation.  They take from their spread and add to a core product the features that work.  I believe they'll eventually offer a suite of centralized services and hardware similar to Apple, leveraging their cloud infrastructure that they're still building upon.As for Stadia, game streaming was never going anywhere.  The latency will never be good enough for it to be enjoyable in my opinion, and they've begun pushing the Google Play Games for Windows.  That'll be their winner.Google will continue to kill it, and their ecosystem will be improved upon.  Eventually they'll entrench users the same way apple does, but with less expensive hardware and cheaper access to said ecosystem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 11:20:38'] The problem with google is that everyone knows that they won‚Äôt support their new products, so people don‚Äôt trust their new products, so people don‚Äôt use them, so google cancels those products and the cycle repeats.Google has a trust issue, customers don‚Äôt trust the longevity of their new products. And they won‚Äôt solve that any time soon, because it would mean having to do a complete change of mentality and support their products no matter what so people regain trust

They lead in every layer of the AI stack from Silicon all the way up to the applications.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:00:15'] I don't want Google to waste its time running Google Photos Print. If it burns through 100 startups to acquire the next YouTube, it's worth it. Google bought YouTube at $1.6 billion in 2006, and now it's worth about 100 times that. Those are the products that Google cares about. Those are the products that I care about too, because they actually bring shareholder value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 06:10:58'] Do you just hate Google?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 08:16:49'] They actually have a pretty good AI language model internally, so good that an engineer thought it gained consciousness (remember the reports?).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 06:30:55'] Under Steve Balmer, MSFT grew its revenue and earnings hugely.  It solidified the position of its existing products and entrenched them in the enterprise space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:40:35'] All in Podcast revealed something very insightful regarding the new ai chatgbt and Google income risk.  If this ai chat can give a user an answer instead of using Google to search for the answer, then it reduces Google's ability to shows ads from it's main revenue driver of Google search.  Microsoft is a huge backer of chatgbt, and may be able to bundle or monitize this service across many of it's product lines creating a defacto Google search replacement because of integration.  Whether Microsoft has the permission with its current partnership arrangement with the developer of chatgbt I have no idea.  It's eye opening to see that pioneering companies could possibly be challenged by up and coming ai software.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 13:31:15'] Had an interesting revelation last year. Realized that between YouTube, Google maps, Android, and Google search, I was using an Alphabet product around 50 times a day. Promptly bought 4 shares (Currently -31%).Not sure if they can continue to innovate moving forward, but for me, Google has become an absolutey ubiquitous part of daily life. They also have a war chest of roughly 116 billion dollars. Let me repeat 116 billion. That buys a lot of innovation.Worst case, growth stalls and they start paying a dividend. I could live with that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 19:45:50'] The issue has been that it really hasn't been all that successful at developing new verticals.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 04:52:11'] It's certainly too big to fail in any way. Since it rests on a base of unique services that do make a lot of money I feel that they can have the freedom to experiment and fail a few times
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 08:38:43'] Google is on the cusp of transitioning to a growth company to a mature company that's probably going to pay dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:39:46'] I own a large portion of shares of GOOG and, while they certainly need to keep the pipeline robust, I do agree with the author of the post, in that, a lot of their product launches avail to huge hype and then fizzle out.Google is very fortunate that they have Search, YouTube, Android, GE, cloud, however, I do, every once in a while, wonder if this company is going to turn into the next Intel or IBM‚Ä¶what I mean by that is that if they don‚Äôt continue to innovate and simply rest on their laurels then, over the course of time, someone will overtake them. How soon that will be, or if that day will come, certainly remains to be seen, however, the company is 1. Over staffed. 2. To their own admission not enough employees are making a meaningful impact and 3. With all of those new hires, not one shred of something promising is even near to appearing in the pipeline.The reason I continue to hold the name is because it is a cash cow company. Their balance sheet is a fortress and they do have significant consumer reach with Search and YouTube.If cloud could get to profitability, that would be a huge benefit but that seems to be quite a ways off from what I‚Äôm hearing from the company internally as their are two thought process that seem to be dividing management, one side wants to push the growth side whereas the others side wants to see profitability sooner rather than later.Time will tell but I still think it‚Äôs a solid hold for at least the next few years, especially at these prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:41:00'] Google turned into an Indian spam company.  Similar to Microsoft where almost everything has a half ass feel. Quality just sucks. Nothing seems to work as it should. The Google ecosystem is terrible. The only thing they have working correctly is what it had prior to 2007: Google search and YouTube. They keep starting projects and making them half ass. Tons of services that don‚Äôt work as well as smaller companies w similar products. Compared to apple it‚Äôs obviously way worse. But even against Amazon. Amazons tech and services are a lot more higher in quality. Feels much better. I think now it‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to get rid of that Google ceo and replace with someone with much better focus and can control better it‚Äôs myriad of services to monetize the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. I understand it‚Äôs my opinion on the services and not the stock but I do think these are the reasons a stock will perform better in the future. Completely the fault of the ceo. Yes, he knows web browsers and the reason chrome is the #1 but that‚Äôs seems to be it. He can be moved to the browser team leader and that‚Äôs it. Leave ceo stuff for someone who knows how to run a company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 07:48:34'] I think one of the biggest problems Google could be facing is regulatory  problems. They are a monopoly on how information is disseminated to the public.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 06:52:54'] Google makes good products and has some of the smartest engineers on the planet. The problem is they have a poor business team internally. The company is clearly engineering first. In some ways Google is like the startup that never stopped growing. Google has innovated, the fact that Chrome became so successful is a testament. I also think the chrome cast is a solid device with some performance related issues at times. ChatGPT is a legitimate competitor to Google if it ever becomes a real commercial product. Google has to innovate its core service with search to really have a future. Google is very much ingrained in the world though. There is no serious competitor to Google Maps. I also think things like Google‚Äôs cloud based Office Suite competitor are really good. Both Google Sheets and Docs are just so much better than any competitor it‚Äôs not even funny.Gmail is fine too. At worst Google this decade becomes like Microsoft in the 00s.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 07:55:56'] Google has been more of a software company than a hardware one, like Apple. Google's innovations are in their AI and it's been like that for many years. Whether it's allowing their AI to screen your calls or to set up appointments for you, many of their innovations aren't in building products but building services that work within products.A great representation of this is their developer conference. They'll show off products on the first day and for the remainder of the conference, it's about developers.

It still wouldn't be fun to loose fx. Office, but it would most likely not kill them.Google is heavily reliant on adds, but though spread to different platforms, so they are trying to get a lot of different products out there, to diversify. A billion here and a billion there.But one problem when you have a pair of golden titties to milk, is that you don't go hunting that hard. So if something isn't an immediate success, they dumb it, and they often don't set it up for that success either
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:14:13'] Big companies cannot innovate effectively to maintain leadership. The pressures to deliver earnings is too strong. Facebook's pivot to Meta is a perfect example. It MIGHT be the best long term decision but it is killing earnings and shareholders will not tolerate it. This is why they try and purchase younger companies but that only delays the inevitable. There are a few exceptions. Microsoft has truly built a great business in Azure from scratch. This has saved the company from eventual irrelevance but that was after many, many products and acquisitions fell flat. ORCL and CRM keep buying up the competition to maintain market share and that has been working as well. Just be cautious betting that a large market leader can innovate its way to continuing leadership.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 11:12:08'] Google uses to be quite innovative when the founders were involved in the day to day. But they weren't innovative in the sense that they came up with completely new products nobody could imagine, but versions of products that blew people away over time. Like Google vs Yahoo. Android vs iOS and Windows Mobile. Chrome vs Internet Explorer and Firefox.So really, they did great on execution and reimagining of existing things. And Eric Schmidt was a good balance where he brought enough pressure for the ideas to have some sort of payoff horizon and pressure to finish projects that otherwise would be canceled.Once Eric left and the two founders took a backseat, the founders got obsessed with not being disrupted and spending cash to find the next big thing. They incentiized the the creation of project after project regardless of whether or not they were successful, and didn't pressure anyone to succeed at a project to get compensated, so they ended up funding half-baked ideas, conflicting products like 19 different messenger apps, and a self driving program that is literally impossible to scale without driver data like Tesla.The example I'd use is California or Russia or any government with incredible natural resources. You'd think these governments would just build off these incredible resources to become amazing paradises, but the more abundant the resources, the more likely it is that the government is corrupt or incompetent. Singapore only exists because it has an amazingly competent government; it basically has no resources.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 11:38:23'] I think those killed products are telling you that Google still innovates and is pretty shitty with putting good products on the market. For example, Google wave was a really cool messaging app. It got killed because nobody fucking knew it existed. Now the code lives in Google Docs. I think that Google docs, sheets and presentations are far superior to whatever Microsoft is offering but people still use office 365 even when it sucks hard.        What I also like about google is that they release tons of different project to see what sticks and what technology they can butcher and more and make better. I think it's risk vs reward game.     I think they are still relevant now and they are relevant in the future because of AI and quantum computing.

Their process involved telling everyone what they were doing and hoping for the best. Now that Google has interested buyers for their newer speculative assets, they don‚Äôt need to tell anyone about them, and their share price reflects the decision to not build buzz.They are making tons of new stuff, just not as much for consumers.

And if one new project gets realised, even once in a 5 years - they don't need anything else.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 19:01:45'] The thing with google is that they have so much money that they just hire anybody that could potentially dethrone them from their leaders position.It is a common theme in all big techs. They pay a lot of people to do basically nothing, because the cost outweigh the risks of one of those people being their competition.One could argue that the current situation at twitter is similar. They fired like thousands of people, for a company that requires 50 people to run.... That is a lot of new people to be afraid of

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 20:19:54'] I wouldn't say those products are unsuccessful. If you go through the website most of them are outdated/old. Google is a leader in tech and by being in the SWE field in general, they must put their resources to innovative and up-to-date projects.Along with top comments here saying most of their asset is user data which is true, I would add that the products Google does create are geared to that among other behind-the-scenes services. That's why the typical investor would ponder Google's value in the market as oppose to a company like Apple whose products take on a physical form and are much more commonly used by people in general (iPhones, Apple watches. Macbooks, etc).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 02:05:31'] Any large company will eventually succumb under its own weight. Jeff Bezos is very candid about it: he thinks Amazon has max. another 30 years or so. Companies are looking for constant growth and lose focus of what made them great. Google search is nothing what it used to be for example. Gmail is not userfriendly, I prefer to use my Apple Mail app. Youtube is constantly changing the rules for content creators so they are looking for alternatives. Et cetera.   Its sheer size will keep it afloat but other companies will be challenging it on various fronts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 02:11:40'] Google is just one part of Alphabet. The main threat to google itself IMO is ChatGpt and similar AI, but Alphabet literally has more powerful AI sitting in its back shed. Google itself doesn't need to be too innovative; it has a solid moat, for now, and until something that can compete against it comes up it can simply focus on improving what already works.  The remainder of Alphabet's subsidiaries are almost uniquely innovative; Deepmind, for instance, is a competitor to OpenAI, Waymo is a leader, maybe even the in the self-driving car industry. The list goes on.  Overall, I'd say the stock is an extremely strong purchase; low P/E compared to competitors, solid low-risk business with a strong moat and potential to grow even further. If only they offered dividends...  Although even then, the fact that they don't shows confidence that they can further increase their market cap without doing so.

Add in Nest, Waze, Fitbit and everything else they've bought, it's hard not to see them as incredibly innovative. If anything, the number of projects they've killed is a measure of their innovation. You don't get this many hits and homeruns without a lot of at bats.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 05:31:54'] The products they need to succeed, succeed. They couldn't care less if you use a Pixel, most people use an Android with Gapps, most people use Google to do online searches, most webs relay on Google analytics to study their demographics... Google is a data company, they don't care if you buy some product from them as long as you use enough some of their products. You're not buying from them, they're selling *from you*.What I might agree, is that they hold such a vast amount of data that they don't have much to grow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 10:44:06'] Nah, bullshit. When you measure innovation based on new consumer products alone, you‚Äôre missing the point. Innovation is what Google does to enhances existing user products and efficiencies, engagement, revenue. They have a phenomenal scale in search, mail, devices, OS, cloud, mapping, video/social media with YouTube, and more. They will continue to squeeze dollars out and learn to squeeze more along the way. Now the company is prioritizing profit over growth they will shift resources in to near term profits. When the tides change and growth is appealing they‚Äôll go right back into niche projects.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-02 01:13:38'] Commoditization of their key lines - particularly smartphones and tablets.In 20 years if a top line cell phone can be sold for $200 instead of $1000 it‚Äôs going to cut revenue and margins. They can get away with selling $1000 phones when others are $600, $800 or whatever, but they are anchored by the price of their competition. If the Motorola‚Äôs, LG‚Äôs and huawei of the world start selling near peer devices for 5 or 600 less apple will have to drop prices.  I was frankly surprised at how easily people accepted the $1000 phones when prices had been stable or declining in real terms for years. This won‚Äôt go on forever. Just like PC‚Äôs, Laptops and TV‚Äôs  mobile phones and tablets will drop down in price over time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-02 01:14:59'] The biggest risk is that smartphone upgrade cycles start getting longer and longer. Smartphones get so good that people stop upgrading as frequently because their phone is already great. Same for smartwatches, etc. Apple will be perfectly fine when this happens, but growth would slow.Same thing happened to computer upgrade cycles. How often do people upgrade their desktops or laptops? I'm using a 6 year old laptop that's still got years of life.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-02 01:42:28'] Critical thinking classes and a cultural shift from the way a lot of people see prestige.   Apple value is in brand, so as long as their products are expensive and other companies will keep on creating new ideas that apple can merge into prettier things, apple is not going anywhere.   You can search for a test where they did neural scans on apple customers and they relate to apple brand like to an actual person that they like. When compared to Samsung - noting happened. So apple value is not built on rational numbers so you should follow culture shifts not what the company does itself.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-02 02:13:44'] Not the answer you may expect but if Apple were to no longer be 'cool' that could significantly hurt them. If something happened to the public image of Apple or it became 'uncool' to kids to buy Apple then another brand could easily swoop in and charge higher margins for a name brand that people want to display and use as a status symbol. This has happened to many fashion brands that could once charge a premium but are now undesirable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-02 03:17:15'] Apple doesn't necessarily have to do anything wrong, they just have to stop growing.The thing with Apple is that their products have pretty much peaked.In the early days of the iPhone, the generational differences were massive. Second gen introduced GPS, turn-by-turn navigation, and the app store. Third gen introduced multitasking, FaceTime and the front-facing camera. That incredible pace of innovation ultimately translated into growth, both in market share and in value.Flash forward to 2020 and what did we get? A slightly higher resolution display that nobody but phone nerds will ever notice, and new color options. It's not their fault, it's just that smartphones are boring now - even an entry-level Huawei phone satisfies all of the needs of the average consumer and more.This trend is playing out across all of Apple's products. Think about the differences between Panther and Leopard, versus the differences between Catalina and Big Sur.I don't expect Apple to shrink any time soon (it would take a lot to dislodge the average Apple consumer from that ecosystem) but I do think that they are going to stop growing. Ripe markets like renewable tech, AI, and electric cars have far more room for innovation and growth than venerable markets like smartphones and operating systems.

For several, amzn/goog/msft, I feel like their biggest threat is anti-trust but honestly if you compare what msft went through in the 90s, these guys are having a walk in the park and plus I think if some sectors of amzn and goog were forced to spinoff, that could be a big plus for shareholders (I'm looking at you, aws).

An inflation level of 4% would be a huge improvement form last year's levels but still far from enough for the Fed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 07:47:36'] We're drawing a lot of comparisons between this downturn and the 1970s. Presumably because that's the most recent recession caused by extreme inflation, as well as being one of the worst inflationary periods in our history.But it's much easier to find comparisons between now and the 1949 recession. It was basically a supply run brought on a by a variety of factors but mostly due to soldiers returning home from war and starting families and finding new jobs. There was a huge jump in home prices and demand for things like ovens and other goods shot through the roof.We're almost in the opposite side of the same coin - supply dropped off a cliff due to covid and therefore demand shot through the roof.Obviously there are other factors to take into account but during that time but there are way more similarities to 1949 than 1970s oil crisis, in my opinion. That recession lasted for a year and unemployment peaked at 7.1%. It was one of the mildest recessions the US has had.https://recession.tips/the-recession-of-1949/https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/usa/history/recession-of-1949.htm

You'd see some things drop out of favour at exactly the wrong time (while they are down in price) like those energy stocks.Bogleheads would probably be pretty constant, though you might see things like small cap value ETFs go into and out of favour.Dividends this year would be SCHD, JEPI, O, and some other individual stocks.

I know we're all mostly here for sexier picks, and believe me I have that gambling streak too and own lots of CRM, META, AMZN, and yes even some Gee Emm Eee.  But the vast portion of my portfolio is in broad market funds and AAPL and it will stay that way.

Nobody thinks  positively about him. But excluding his face and the logo, what else is left that identifies the company? Having him try and sell the Metaverse with his Uncanny Valley face and mannerisms was something right out of the TV show Silicon Valley. He might as well have named his venture HooliVerse.

I think they are saying if a third party app collects data on you, which you specifically allowed when you installed the app, Apple might use that data too. An example is when you use a third party exercise app and Apple updates your stats in their health app. Or Apple suggest other exercise apps in the store. But I don‚Äôt see any specific right for a third party app to ‚Äúmisuse‚Äù your data - whatever that means.Personally I‚Äôve been moving towards using fewer 3rd party apps in general and using Apple‚Äôs stuff instead (Maps, Safari, Fitness+, etc) which is exactly what Apple was hoping everyone would do.

Tim Cook has qualms about that and it sickens him a little but Google is the best in many ways plus their cash is not something to sneeze at so he did it for the good of the company and platform.  The #1 search query on Bing is "Google".  People know Google tracks and mines them but they offer so much for free that people don't mind so much.Facebook is a different animal. for one thing it let Putin and Trumpsters use 10 millon fake lying trolls in 2016 to weaponize and rig our election, a surprise attack for which Facebook was very well paid.  Olus since those trolls and fake news sites generated so much user activity they could brag on user numbers and activity to raise ad costs and the stock price.Since the GOP could not admit the 2016 election was rigged they stayed mum on the troll issue until facebook started removing the worst of the Russian disinformation trolls and then they complained FB was censoring "conservative voices", really Russian fascist liars, to which Zuckerberg explained that he is jewish and disagrees with Nazis but he had to let them keep lying.  Finally Zuck did the right thing and booted Trump but too little too late. Now the GOP is controlled by Russian fascism and our entire democracy is in grave danger.Fast forward to this last two months when Zuck sees Facebook user activity falling fast and regulatory brick wall ahead and changes the company name and focus to Meta-verse which doesn't even exist yet and which may never take off, or if it does it may take off on other platforms instead, or a thousand different ones.  All things considered, I would avoid FB stock for all kinds of reasons including the fact that it may still be 200% overvalued with Instagram as the only real jewel left in its crown. and how long will that last?  I am already sick of obnoxious Instagram influencers trying to make people envious of their perfect lifestyles.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 00:55:59'] Apple is a pretty safe stock but if you want to diversify a little, you could sell some of your Apple share and allocate them into the S&P. But holding onto Apple long term wouldn‚Äôt be that risky. The only risks are regulatory but over the long term I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 00:54:02'] I wish I was as smart at your age...
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:26:11'] Here's another way to look at this.  You are not going to be 24 forever, and your current portfolio will grow and diversify over time.  $50K in AAPL sounds like a lot to you now, but when your portfolio is seven figures - *and it will be* \- you won't blink at it.All this risk people are talking about because of the high AAPL allocation is more or less irrelevant, as these shares are in your IRA, destined for use in 25+ years.Leave AAPL alone, set it to DRIP, be happy you acquired a decent amount of it, and buy other stuff over time to diversify.  ("Yeah, I started accumulating that back in the '20s, pretty amazing, right?" --- you in 2041)
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 05:24:24'] Apple has been my most consistent stock over the last 20 years.  I tend to buy stocks where I believe in their ability to continue to be successful by innovating and producing best of class products.  Apple in my opinion is the best product in our tech lives.  Many so called financial wealth planners have told me that Apple is over valued and that the growth cannot keep coming - my response is that as an investment Amazon and Apple have so much cash that if they ever have a problem or someone creates a product to top theirs, they can simply use their cash to fix that.  That is a huge luxury and insulator for those businesses.  I think will go through a slower 2021 but if you are looking for long term investment, Apple is a great place to be.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:22:30'] If it were me, id have the larger percentage in VOO and smaller percentage in individual stocks like AAPL (i currently own both).  It all boils down to how aggressive you want to be.However, you pretty much can‚Äôt lose with a stock like AAPL.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:52:52'] Sell far OTM calls for your Apple stock and with the premium and the dividend from the Apple stock start building little by little into your s&p500 position. If you ever get assigned, you can sell cash covered puts for Apple and decided if you want to use the money to increase your s&p 500 position or buy again into Apple
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:30:01'] If it was me, I would leave the Apple shares and just build a diversified portfolio around it with new purchases over time.  It‚Äôs about how comfortable do you feel that this company will be around a long time and has a good competitive advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:04:47'] Apple is like a saving account, people will put extra money in it, just keep holding apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 06:19:51'] The S&P500 is very heavily invested in AAPL, and it's for that reason it's been doing so well.I would say there's a trade-off in both cases:1) if you swap to the S&P, you diversify while still holding AAPL, technically. If tech crashes, you're not going to lose as much, but you're also not going to gain as much if tech continues its run.2) if you hold AAPL, you'll benefit from any splits/dividend increases that come from it, and it's a company that seems to be doing both. but if something happens to tech or apple, it's all gone.I personally have some SPY shares, and some AAPL shares, you'll likely be better off starting to invest in, or swapping only partially to, the S&P, while holding onto all/most of your AAPL shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 06:35:08'] Enviable position to be in! From the info you‚Äôve even given I‚Äôd suggest a bit of diversification because massive corporations have fallen unexpectedly before so eggs in a singe basket is risky in the long term because giants fall hard when they fall.Overall it sounds like you‚Äôre doing great though so I don‚Äôt think my suggestions are much worth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 06:54:11'] Honestly keep it in apple, sell a portion of it maybe go travel, lease a nice car, live life a little (important).

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 07:45:38'] Haven‚Äôt seen this posted yet, but buying an index of S&P like VOO will still give you exposure to AAPL. ~5-6% of the S&P is AAPL. The vast majority of research supports dollar cost averaging into an index fund. Use play money to invest in individual stocks. The majority of professionals who pick individual stocks, and spend all day researching, still lose vs the index. Why would you do any better with less expertise and a full time job that isn‚Äôt researching equities? It‚Äôs boring advice but it‚Äôs the truth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 07:47:57'] In my opinion right now (Could change), Apple is a stock I plan on never selling (and im in my low 20's)Price of apple falls one day, week, month= Add more to my portfolio.I currently have a couple other stocks like that in my portfolio.Reasoning; After investing in apple, I now look around when im out in public and notice around 75% of people are carrying an iPhone or AirPods or apple watch etc.I am one of those people, I own a Mac, iPhone, AirPods and considering getting a Apple Watch. I am basically locked into the apple cloud and it will take a lot to reconsider changing my phone. When apple gets into EV (which they will) they will have tons of growth. APPL has enough cash to do anything and keep up with the latest technology.With that being said, apple is not the only stock I own but will continue to add to my position.$SPY is a great ETF that I will also slowly add to my position over time. Like you said you make around 70K a year, so IMO id keep ur apple and continue to add S&P ETF when you can.hopefully that helps! Also always do ur own research, this is my opoinion and I could be completely wrong ahah.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 08:06:00'] Hard to say. Obviously s&p would be safer. I sold a bunch of apple and Tesla years ago that would be worth north of $4 mil today had I not sold any. So I‚Äôd say buy stocks like that to hold for the long term and use your income to diversify into other stocks, ETF‚Äôs or whatever as well.These giant tech companies have fucking mountains of cash that they use on R&D, so they keep innovating and staying ahead of the competition. They have almost unlimited resources, so are incredibly well positioned to maintain their edge and continue their profitability.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 09:33:20'] The biggest threat of going "all Apple" is lack of diversification.   I advise my employees (and my kids), for a decades long investment, to invest in both the SP500 and NASDAQ 100.   Conservative is 90/10 split.  More aggressive is 50/50.  I retired at 56 with zero debt because of the SP500.  But tech wasn't a viable option when I started.  It's a tech world now though. And remember, a stock market dip is a huge opportunity.  You don't lose if you don't sell.   And you make money when you buy into it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 10:39:06'] I believe FAANG stocks are still long-term holds. You could move to a tech index like QQQ but over 30 years the larger caps are likely going to over-perform. To me Apple and Amazon probably have the best long-term growth potentials, so I would keep holding. You can try to balance out your portfolio by putting new earnings into an index fund vs buying more individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 10:40:02'] It‚Äôs ok to diversify a bit. But having a lot of Apple stock and holding it long term is a winning strategy in my non-professional, not financial advise opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 10:54:17'] Given your average price is only $130 selling now won't be too bad in terms of taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 11:40:55'] Apple's fine. And you're 24, so you shouldn't worry about the risk of a stock like Apple.Just whatever you do, max out your ROTH IRA every year while you can.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 12:45:24'] At a base price of 132.00 per share you need to hold. Especially with new phone release toward end of year, no brainer, long time holder!!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 12:45:57'] I would hold on to it but manage downside risk by selling covered calls
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 12:54:54'] I would leave it in AAPL and start purchasing S&P with any new money going into the account.You are young, 24. If you were older I would suggest diversity.Wealth is created with concentration and preserved with diversity (to a point of course).
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 12:58:50'] S&P is ridiculously, unsustainably overvalued. Yes, it can go higher, but not forever in the near-term. Very long term, sure. I'm not saying cash out, not at all. But maybe shift some profits to stuff like TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) ETFs like STIP to better position yourself to take advantage of a major pullback. Their face value rises with inflation, pretty low volatility/risk, and yield competitive with major dividend stock ETFs at 2-3%. For reference, in the March 2020 crash, STIP only briefly dipped about 2% and then immediately went back up a couple weeks later. It's a good inflation and market volatility hedge, and can be a strategic position to take advantage of pullback stock prices. Just my two cents. Also, nice humble brag, lol. (Kidding, but also not really.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 13:15:03'] There isn't a compelling reason to sell Apple's stock right now, but as others have said, from here on I'd start buying VTI. Apple is such a large company now that you probably won't see explosive growth like in the past, but it is a steady investment.

Was only able to purchase 100 shares.  Multiple splits later, I now have 700+ shares with a six digit gain.  The sad thing is that I sold half when it initially doubled.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 04:07:19'] If you are into stocks and wish to look for deals, and learn how to value a company etc, then I would diversify, and try to find another 2 or 3 great companies besides Apple that you would really like to invest in. If you want to be a passive investor, I would rebalance a little and put more money in some etf, if Apple is such a big %
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 06:34:26'] Realistically, you already have exposure to the S&P500 through VOO. So putting the rest  in SPY is basically doubling down on the market. Nothing wrong with it, but you're young and already well ahead of most.Also, there is an option of selling some of Apple and spread your exposure around to other sectors. There are plenty of sector ETFs that may be strong in the coming years. XLI is interesting to me with the infrastructure deal. SMH if you're bullish on semiconductors. You mention interest in EV plays, ICLN/QCLN.

If you do end up taking this route, make sure to be aware of capital gains because if you do the whole 50k you may end up at another bracket
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 08:00:32'] Hell no.

No, not likely, but definitely possible and worth diversifying at least a little so you don‚Äôt get wiped out by one stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 08:11:45'] trade inside your IRA, diversify.  Keep the apple, but maybe if the market value is 50k - keep it there.  trim a little when it goes over 50k - sell a share or 2.   When it starts to rally again, let it fly and then set a new level say - 60k, trim trim trim, reinvest.  But try to do it inside the IRA
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 08:18:52'] Yes 100%. Apple is the biggest weighting in sp and the alpha you by holding apple vs the sp had diminished largely over the years. There‚Äôs no such thing as a safe stock and apple is well past its hyper growth days. It‚Äôs a far better move to just buy the sp
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 08:23:12'] Apple's foray into the medical world is interesting for sure. From a long term investment perspective the safe play would be the S&P Index. The Warren Buffet $1mil bet (if you haven't read up on it -definitely do!) yielded 7.7% compounding across a 10 year period compared to market makers earnings of 2.2%. &#x200B;At the end of the day diversification can be your best friend.

Things to consider. You are doing great!

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 09:38:40'] Apple is a money making machine, and so is their stock. I‚Äôd be a millionaire in my 30s if I had diverted money into Apple stock instead of focusing on paying down student loans. I would suggest adding to the Apple position any time that a noticeable price dip appears
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 09:39:00'] Don‚Äôt sell Apple, just start investing in something else. Why pay capital gains, (or your marginal income tax rate if the investment has been in the market less than a year), when you can leave it in, and then add to the portfolio?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 09:46:44'] I'd split it between s&p and nasdaq to lean more heavily into the tech sector. Apple is a good hold tho. Everyone who's ever said it's overpriced has been wrong. I doubt it slows down anytime soon, their market share will grow as the 3rd world country's slowly become industrial and modern. They hold a place as a sort of "luxury-esque" brand people pay a premium for.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 09:55:26'] I purchased AAPL in 1998 when I was 18. I used the money I received from my high school graduation and invested (pre iMac). Fast forward 15 years and I was advised by a good friend and financial expert (founded an investment firm) to sell and diversify into an index fund, which honestly makes sense because of the risk involved in having such a large amount of my portfolio invested in one stock. Unfortunately, I still regret taking the advice. I have been slowly purchasing AAPL again but those gains from the 2000s will be hard to reproduce. Not saying it won't happen but just that it was a special time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 04:32:21'] Everyone is saying Apple is safe but nobody says why or for how long. I'm gonna give you some advice as a tech enthusiast and not as an investor.Look, hold on to them, but don't believe Apple is invincible. My recommendation would be to at least hold until they announce the "Apple Car", maybe sell some or most of your stocks right when the hype gets at its highest, because that car might not be as good as people is expecting it to be, or it might be ahead of its time and just not sell well because of that. It is a risky move from them, and Apple products have failed many times. Yeah, they have mostly done great because they have good products, but everything sits around the iPhone, and the smartphone industry is starting to evolve, same goes for the tech industry, moving towards AI and ML, which Apple is not very good at, and probably will never be as good as the competition just because of their focus on "privacy" (mostly BS to justify being behind everyone else in this regard).Look, if the smartphone industry evolves too much and Apple is not the one to lead that change (they are not doing it right now), things might get hard for them. And even if it does not evolve enough and stays mostly the same (form factor-wise), smartphones are getting very competitive right now, and Apple's market share can start decreasing significantly.Apple knows this, that's why they are doing AirPods, Apple TV, and all those subscription services, because they know their stake at the smartphone game is increasingly at risk. And if the iPhone starts going down, everything else will go down with it. That's Apple's biggest issue.No, I don't think they will go down deep, I'm not saying that. But I think Apple's days as the lead in tech are not gonna last as long as people might think. They will stay safe, but if you are thinking about it long term, start questioning yourself... who could and most likely would take Apple's place in the coming years?I would take a look at Google instead, they are an even safer bet IMO, they are doing great in AI, ML, self-driving and many more long term shots that actually matter. They are a very diversified portfolio themselves, since they do so many things, if one fails, they still have many bets on other stuff just as promising, they are great investors when it comes to tech. Their main business, ads, is something that will only get bigger as ecommerce becomes more important and overtakes physical stores and more small businesses start using it. They know tech, they know the internet, and they are very good and have a lot of experience working on long term shots that succeed.As simple as knowing this: they have the data, valuable enough as it is right now, but they are also building the most powerful tech to make use of that data in ways that we could not even imagine.

Sounds like you need to draft an investment plan. When you have a plan, you can drone out the emotions and dont panic sell for example.Sounds like you are somewhat of a beginner. The general advice for beginners and the average joe is to go with broad index funds, like vt or vti. S&p500 fund is fine too,  although then you focus just on the largest companies in one region. You could keep a small part of your portfolio in individual stocks as a hobby. When you get some more exp, yoo could focus more on individual stocks.Hope this helps.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-revenue-4ba5eeaa\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported its first drop in monthly revenue in almost four years as macroeconomic headwinds hit the worlds largest maker of computer chips, putting the groups first-quarter earnings due April 20 in the spotlight.\n\nTSMC (ticker: TSM) reported revenue of 145.4 billion Taiwanese dollars in March ($4.8 billion), down 11% from February and falling 15% from March 2022. Its the first annual drop in monthly revenue since May 2019, according to Dow Jones Newswires.\n\nThe chip making giant flagged in January that as overall macroeconomic conditions remain weak, we expect our business to be further impacted by continued end market demand softness, and customers further inventory adjustment in the first quarter. \n\nBut softness in March may have ushered in a poorer performance than expected for the first three months of 2023, which has the potential to bite investors.\n\nTS'

They became a massively successful cpu designer only recently. They are encouraging developers to do meta verse apps on iOS. They are developing augmented reality hardware.

Cars wouldn't be a big part of the profits even if they produced some - as profit margins of other Apple products FAR exceed of what you can make in cars.

I mean, seriously, how many 5 year olds can say they've outperformed the S&P 500? Not many, that's for sure. In fact, I'm thinking of just copying her investment strategy. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the lead of a kid who's making investment picks based on her love of cheese pizza and vanilla milkshakes?    Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and that no one ‚Äì not even a 5 year old ‚Äì has a crystal ball when it comes to the stock market. But hey, if your daughter's portfolio continues to beat the S&P 500, I might just have to start taking investment advice from her too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 01:01:01'] It depends on whether J Pow will screw it up. As of Q4 2022, BAC had 31% securities portfolio (Treasuries, MBS etc). SIVB which just collapsed, had 57%. These were not marked to market, and instead values reported as "held to maturity" (HTM). You can check out Fed's own data on Assets and Liabilities of commercial banks. There has been significant increase in deposit outflow in Feb 2023, and bank's own borrowings (bank liabilities) has steadily increased in the past 6 months. This is not a good look. Forget about hiking interest rates, staying the same for "high and longer" will continue to cause massive deposit outflow from banks. You are at the mercy of an unhinged Fed if you own bank stocks. The Fed's actions for the past 2 months were wrong and excessive. J Pow's most recent testimony is highly destabilizing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 18:28:21'] Honestly, I‚Äôm pretty happy with my returns in the market, so I can‚Äôt really change much outside of completely unfair advice you can give with 20-20 hindsight (ie buy bitcoin at $1K). Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say (note I was in college during the great financial crisis):1. Start investing excess capital as soon as you can. Compounding is insane and having more money opens up other opportunities to juice your gains (ie selling covered calls for extra, low-risk premium)2. Whenever you feel like the world is going to end, that‚Äôs probably when you should buy. I was worried about markets ‚Äúnot making sense‚Äù in 2012 as I was entering the workforce. I missed out on some nice gains if I had just bought $SPY. Thankfully, I learned my lesson and bought hard during COVID‚Äôs initial market crash, which has paid off very well. 3. Put most of your money into index funds, but also allocate some % of your net worth towards fun. Yeah, if you‚Äôre wrong, it‚Äôll suck. But you also miss out on opportunity by taking no risk. Plus, you can always write off the losses, so the loss isn‚Äôt as bad as it looks on paper. 4. The markets can be irrational for years, but you have to stick to your principles. When people say ‚Äúvaluation doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù, that‚Äôs when a top is likely in.

Start saving & accumulating 6 months of emergency cash before you invest in individual stocks.  It's much easier to weather a bear market if you aren't reliant on the cash invested to pay the rent/mortgage, etc.Also trust your instincts.  If a trade sounds too good to be true, than it prolly is.  And yeah you might miss out on some market insanity like Gamestop 10x gains, but you also won't make 10 similar losing trades.Good Luck.

It's the human condition. Doing this for 10 years imho makes your success possibility over 80%.Look at this example: "Jane" makes $150k a year, after taxes 100k. She lives off of 40k.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi,\n\nI was looking into investing in Broadcom as they appear to be one of the best performing stock (over the last 5 years) in the semiconductor industry. I was wondering if people could share their opinion on them?\n\nThe main risk I see that Apple is about 20% of Broadcom revenue and they might replace the Broadcom wifi chipsets with their inhouse chipsets from FY2025 (There was other news related to Apple pausing development on their wifi chipsets which would benefit Broadcom).'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 16:11:40'] AVGO is a great stock, I own about 50 shares, but the Apple news does concern me. I bought in the low $400s thinking it was too expensive, but it‚Äôs paid off and it‚Äôs good divy growth story. It‚Äôs had a decent run in the past 6 months. A lot of talking heads on CNBC think there‚Äôs gonna be another market pull back, so you may get a good chance to buy under $600.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 10:18:23'] Do not go shopping on the "best-performing stock of the last X years" list after a 12-year bull market. Instead, look for long-lived companies that have grown earnings but not appreciated much.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 22:13:59'] It's an amazingly well run company. Seriously. I'm so happy I own it. That being said, the VMWare merger is so big that it will change the company fundamentally. I think for the better - particular because of the concentration risk Apple just proved to exist, but in truth we won't know what will happen.We don't know if it'll go through and we don't know if it was worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 14:03:38'] I hold SMH(4.7% AVGO), but I know XSD(2.8% AVGO) and SOXX (8% AVGO) are popular semi ETFs as well. IMO AVGO is a pretty stable long term play however with picking any individual stock you run the risk of something happening with that individual company (INTC for example). As others have said, going based purely off of previous performance is a unreliable way to gauge a companies value. I think if there‚Äôs something in specific that you like about Broadcom that sets it apart from similar stocks that you see as a driving factor for potential growth then go for it, however I prefer to hold an ETF as I cannot foresee a single Semiconductor stock outperforming the others. Also if it‚Äôs that juicy dividend that you‚Äôre after then I would recommend SCHD which has Broadcom as its top holding at nearly 5%. You still get a diversified ETF with a 3.5% dividend yield.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 17:08:43'] It's been one of my better performing stocks, it was only $300 in May 2020.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 23:46:37'] Broadcom is an interesting one because they spend all their free cash flow on buybacks, dividends, and acquiring other companies - not as much on innovation. That being said, it's a software/chip powerhouse in pretty good market areas. I sorta view it as a lesser Microsoft, given its diversity. That being said, I bought some dips and sold this recent rip. I think it looks a little rich up here. I kind of like its little brother, Marvell, a tad more because they're so laser-focused on data infrastructure - though I'd be terrified if Broadcom was my biggest competitor.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 18:29:54'] Its a great stock. I own it in SCHD
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 08:47:38'] My take:  We see Apple threatening to drop Broadcom and Qualcomm often because Apple uses that as a bargaining 'chip.'  We've all seen it play out before where Apple back down.  Between then and now, Apple would have already done what they threatened to do if they were going to do it.From the price perspective, I'm no pro, but all I've seen is people waiting on the sidelines when they were sure that $380 per share was too high - they'll wait it out and buy some when it goes lower.  Then $450 was too high, they'll wait it out.  By $500 per share those people realized they missed the boat, and now they wish it would drop back down to $550 per share.Meanwhile, some of us jumped onto the train in the low $300's and just kept buying.  Painful every time, and that pain is completely gone as each year goes by.  If it was so risky now it wouldn't be in the top ten holdings of some of the best performing ETF's out there.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 23:52:11'] Spark is paying [100% imputed dividend](https://investors.sparknz.co.nz/Investor-Centre/?page=Latest-Dividend), I believe that means the dividend you received is already taxed, and if your tax bracket is lower than the imputation tax rate, you may use the credits to offset your other taxes. Sounds complicated, you may want to check on IRD website or ask an accountant friend. As for your question, if you use the [compound interest calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm), starting with $50,000 with an interest rate of 6.91%, you'll get $371,124.73 in 30 years. The catch is, as others have pointed out, stock is not term deposit and dividend is not interest, it actually deducts from your share price after it is paid. E.g. Share price before payout is $6.00, after a dividend of $0.30 per share is paid out, the share price is automagically adjusted to $5.70 the next day. However, for a stable, healthy company, the share price will always recover and get ready for the next dividend payout, otherwise the company stock will go to zero after few years' dividend payout. In short, your $370K in 30 years depends on:1. Company's stock performance, it can go up, down or even split.2. Company's ability to maintain its dividend yield. 6.91% is quite high, higher than most AU/NZ banks! I'm not sure if it's sustainable for the entire 30 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 14:12:07'] Speaking for my neck of the woods, Uber is just dominating. Eats and Advertising has allowed them to maintain cash flow. There are *way* more drivers on Uber than Lyft (I always check both). And subsequently the price on Lyft is way higher due to less supply of drivers available. I just think Lyft lost. Which I hope isn‚Äôt true because Uber needs competition. We have an entire generation of people that haven‚Äôt ever called a cab in their life, and probably won‚Äôt in the future.

Every year every quarter is the same and nothing changes. The fact this stock is trading as high as where its at currently is nothing short of a miracle. The only direction I see them going to avoid this road of bankruptcy they are on is they need to be bought by another company. Other then that I see no future for this company and why anybody is buying shares is beyond my level of comprehension apparently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 01:52:10'] To be a successful social media company, you need to entice the big players. For example, when you see LeBron James social media accounts, no one ever says, "Follow him on SNAPCHAT." That's Snapchat's biggest issue: It's mainly a messaging social media service for teenagers and these teenagers have low buying power so fittingly, companies are going to pay SNAPCHAT much less than they would pay for the same ads on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., Another issue is the entire app is just stupid and redundant. I don't see a 'company' behind SNAP. I just see an optional product that isn't going to change anyone's quality of life. If SNAPCHAT was gone tomorrow, those users will just move on to the next app. If Instagram was gone, you'll see a huge wave of people who will be begging for Instagram to be brought back. There's just no real brand behind SNAP.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 02:54:29'] Well. If I have enough money, I will buy 3 iPads and 2 MacBooks per year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 02:04:27'] While your end conclusion might be right, this analysis is unfortunately very flawed.First of all, they have been buying back a lot of shares. I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.Secondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.There are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.In conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued. However, a simple analysis of a company top line doesn't tell us anything of value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 03:31:15'] It's certainly an interesting theory, and probably true to some extent. However, my thoughts:1) The transition from Intel-based Macs to M1 is still mid-way through. There's still the 27" iMac replacement due as well as the top-end Mac Pro. There's a ton of people holding out for these. Self-employed designers and filmmakers, right up to small and mid-sized studios who probably last updated to the 2018 iMac Pro.2) Going on from that, there's still barely enough stock to meet demand of the newly released 14" and 16" MBP which are absolute game-changers for the company. Once supply chain issues are worked out, these will sell like hot cakes.3) Potential new product categories - though they may not launch this year, any announcement of AR Glasses or a Car will bound to create a ton of buzz around the company and drive interest.4) A ton of apps are dropping support for iOS 12, including mammoths like WhatsApp, Netflix etc. The iPhone 6 is locked to iOS 12, and a huge amount of people are still rocking those. They're now feeling pressured to update to a new iPhone to continue using their favourite apps.I think the 2020 surge of sales was definitely beneficial, but mostly for the MBA and MBP and mid-range iPads. Stuff that sells itself anyway.

Where many companies saw a "crush" during the pandemic, now we'll get to compare 2022 to 2021 (which should be better than 2021 to 2020). I think this will be interesting across most of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 05:44:32'] Apple changes their Corporate structure which allows them to hold less cash and pay more to investors, even if their earnings drop in the short term they can easily maintain 3-4% buybacks + dividends with long term growth. They are fine
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 05:45:09'] People have been saying they are overvalued for a decade and yet they still out perform every year almost. I‚Äôm not betting against them. Especially while they continue to dive into the health tech sector and have an EV reportedly coming in 2025, all while having a TON of cash and great margins. I‚Äôll be buying more this year per usual.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 06:21:56'] I think the real concern about Apple's valuation isn't what revenue or profit growth they've experienced in the last few years, it's the reasons why the market has given Apple a higher valuation.In short, a lot of hype over products that are at least a few years out (at a minimum) from entering the market have driven their stock price up. The Apple car being the biggest example of this, but Apple VR/glasses hype has also driven up the stock price. There's major risks with both of these projects that aren't being acknowledged by the market. People are just assuming that because it's Apple of course they can make a car or a robotaxi work, or of course people will want to buy smartglasses from them even though Google Glasses failed miserably in the market despite all the hype before it was released.Whenever the EV bubble pops Apple is almost certainly going to see a big drop in share price because of this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 07:24:48'] Great Explanation. I can't say it any better. I agree with you fully
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 07:46:48'] The free cash flow yeild for apple is pretty good tho with 3.6%
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 08:14:54'] I agree. 2020 and 2021 we can all agree is an anomaly, not just for Apple. Apple has historically been a mid single digit growth company. Their primary markets long ago reached saturation. I‚Äôm expecting Apple to return to mid single digit growth, and multiple compression back down to the mid teens. Which is in line with what you would expect to pay for slow growth, and Apple pre-2019 when rapid multiple expansion started.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 10:32:18'] "our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH".Great post and I agree.  Year 2022 may still be great (and not CRUSH) for Apple when they will announcing some new products (metaverse related, autonomous driving, and/or more health wearable products).APPL is my top holding (#1 and being a long term investor of APPL) so naturally, I want APPL shares to be up and up overtime.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 16:11:29'] Bearish on AAPL as well. There‚Äôs a 4 day inventory for semiconductors right now that‚Äôs going to wreck AAPL if there‚Äôs a distribution supply issue. There‚Äôs no room for error. Sure, they may have inventory sitting in storages for now, but is it enough to supply projected sales? No. October 2021 showed their vulnerability when they lost $6B in revenue due to chip shortage. 52% of net sales are iPhones alone. I‚Äôm not going to think there‚Äôs enough in WIP Inventory to supply what they need eventually. They probably estimated the inventory life for semis at like 24+ days.Plus, if and when Taiwan gets invaded, US is probably going to sanction off trade to China and given that China represents 10% of current customer segment, that‚Äôs a blow.Their stocks are overvalued - doesn‚Äôt make sense how they can all of a sudden gets so hyper overinflated between the periods you pointed out. They got money pumped in so hard and now it‚Äôs holding high at its current inflation. I expect declines in AAPL and it‚Äôll feel the impact of the market correction of this and next year. If China conflict happens (maybe after Beijing Olympics), it‚Äôs going to drop even more.No thanks

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 15:48:34'] Legitimately, this could work for you. However, I recommend looking at the historic chart, and compute how much money you would lose or gain if it goes to certain price targets. If it drops to $100, you may lose $4000. If it goes to $145, you may gain $3000. Are these risks that you are willing to take, because emotionally it can be difficult to watch that money. Mathematically, if you can stomach it, I think all in AAPL for long term is a totally legitimate strategy

OP the value of a stock is not the price it trades for, Amazon which trades for idk 12x the cost of Apple is valued at 2/3rd of Apple. You did buy an overall good stock just may wanna research some more first. And trust me Apple is highly ‚Äúregulated‚Äù by big money, they will always control the value of Apple hence why it moves so little and on many days controls the S&P 500. I think this lack of understanding may have been why people suggested an ETF. Also the investor who DCA‚Äôs their money will be more successful 9/10 times. Also good to train your brain to be happy when the market or asset goes down for a reason that won‚Äôt affect the long term, because investors are buyers and buyers want things cheaper - this is a lesson that took me a couple months to wire my brain to. Green Day‚Äôs are nice, but I almost never buy on green days. Would you rather buy your coffee for 3$ or buy the same coffee for 5$? That‚Äôs the mentality of a long term investor. I wish the best of luck to you OP, you did pick well even though your not diversified. Just please learn more before throwing around what sounds like a lot of money to you. And ALWAYS REMEMBER if it‚Äôs a good company and it‚Äôs down from where you bought it than in the long run it will eventually surpass where you bought it, which I‚Äôm not wizard but I bet Apple will surpass 130 again easily.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 13:46:49'] Take part of the rest of the money you have and spread it out a bit. It doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be boring. Buy some high dividend stocks like CAPL or USAC. Buy some other blue chips and build them up over time. Research some penny stocks and invest a small amount there. But, that is, only if you‚Äôre interested in learning how the market works and enjoy it. My guess is, otherwise, you‚Äôre going to get bored just watching AAPL and wondering if you really can hold it for five years. Just my two cents
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 20:16:29'] Just my opinion - You can also check on how to create a covered call(with stocks you own) and make money out of premium while holding the stock but the risk is you will lose the share if the stock hits the strike price(some times even if they dont if the buyer exercise the option which I dont think anyone do), in which case you will also land a short term profit.You bought for $127. You can create a covered call monthly or weekly for $130 or even $140(the premium will get lower as you increase the strike price). So lets say you sell a covered call for $140. You need 100 shares of a company to sell one call option. I dont know how much monthly premium goes for but lets say its at 0.50 so the premium you get would be $50(minus commission fee if there is any) for selling one covered call. At any time the buyer of the call can exercise the option. He would have to exercise at $140 so you will be making $13 per share or another $1300 for the one call option you sold but when they exercise you lose your share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 18:59:48'] AAPL is a solid stock pick, but the price is currently being held down by a number of factors -- not the least of which is that it's a victim of the company's success: it's the highest market capitalized company in the world, which means it is also one of the most widely held, too. Thus, whenever any fund needs some money to cover losses elsewhere, they sell off Apple stock.On the plus side, Apple has expanded its buyback program to $90B *this year* which means that your shares will be inherently (in 2020, they bought back $50B) Additionally, they are increasing the dividend yield.If you want to make more money on AAPL, look at writing (selling) way out of the money covered-calls.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 21:24:17'] AAPL has done more stock splits that almost any other company in the last 15 years, maybe the most. Good reason for that. 5 years would be a shortfall though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 22:18:17'] If you‚Äôre looking to hold for 5 years wtf do you care about a couple of points?
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 23:06:16'] Just remember AAPL is trading at 125 post-split (pre-split at 500).If there is some sort of market correction in future, do not worry about your shares. This is probably the biggest mistake of rookie investors. Dollar cost averaging is your friend, so buy the dips. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 17:54:44'] AAPL has a PE ratio of 28. The sp500 I believe is around 40. When I started investing I went with investing with ETFs but I pulled out in the last few months. If you find a great company that‚Äôs fairly valued or better, invest in. You could assign as much weight to it as you can. Warren Buffet‚Äôs portfolio i believe is about 40% Apple. Apple‚Äôs ecosystem is amazing. Everyone who uses it loves it. It‚Äôs a premium product but people pay for it. New iPhone should be coming out soon. They‚Äôre coming out with different products such as air tag. And their M chips seem to be very promising. Also check out FMAAG. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of FB, still on the fence about it, but they‚Äôve been crushing it financially. Love the rest of the companies. I believe all of them except Amazon have a PE ratio around 30.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 19:11:46'] I sold 50K of AAPL and bought TGT about two weeks ago.  Not my finest moment, but I got sick of holding the bag.  Hard to double your money when you're sitting a on 2.2T market cap.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 19:45:04'] So this comment may get drowned out by actual numbers and statistics but I paper traded apple about 7 months ago and when I looked I was up like 40 percent, I know that‚Äôs not always going to work like that due to how crazy big tech got for a few months, but it can only work out for you in the long run. Any company that big that you almost know will never fall is a win in my book for the long term
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 20:21:08'] AAPL is a good company to start with; I got into investing with [redacted video game stock] and [redacted movie theater chain stock], once I got in at a depth that I was comfortable I started taking my portfolio more seriously and Apple is one of the companies that's part of that mission.I certainly won't get rich extremely soon on Apple, but they're a consistently strong company that has very consistent growth; very safe for a portfolio that's just starting out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 18:48:21'] How the fuck is Apple overrated???
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 19:39:33'] I like your conviction. Plenty of fund managers and ETFS are heavily weighted towards AAPL. History shows AAPL has been constantly underrated with bears talking about how their best is behind them, yet they are consistently proven wrong. If you want to throw your other 15k on top, go for it. My advice is to figure out if that stresses you out. You shouldn't be checking the ticker every couple of hours or even every day with a longer term view like what you have. If you do decide to invest elsewhere, don't choose another similar tech stock as they will both rise and fall together. Again, nothing wrong with only having one, two or three stocks. Just try to keep those few diversified also, or prepare to set and forget over the short term.Edit: I don't own any AAPL or FAANG stocks

Will it out perform the next 5 years? I have my doubts, but people have been saying that for years now and it continues to do just that.

On the last day of questioning on the trail the judge grilled Tim Cook pretty hard suggesting she isn‚Äôt going to rule totally in Apples favor, although seemed like she might make a carve out for big game developers/apple having a pop-up telling customers they can purchase cheaper thru the gaming company‚Äôs website. If this screws with Apples App Store profits it will hurt the stock. But the company is great and will only go up long term, so if you‚Äôre in it for the long hold you have nothing to worry about. But I‚Äôd suggest selling half your position and rebuying if/when it falls

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-31 23:00:47'] Apple, it‚Äôs not a bad stock, honestly. But a little early. The foldable iPhone should come around 2023 fall. The watch 7 offers nothing really new worth mentioning, other than glucose monitoring. That‚Äôs ‚Äúkinda big‚Äù but it won‚Äôt bring in much, as I don‚Äôt see many in big cities wearing watches, opposed to playing with iPhones or iPads. But when it goes foldable, it‚Äôs big. Get ahead of the announcement, possibly late this year, early next year, and I suspect that Ming Kuo will be the one to leak its OFFICIAL status. >I‚Äôm on Apple‚Äôs Beta Team, in Apple‚Äôs Dev Community, and have followed Apple all the way back to when Steve and Bill Gates, of Microsoft, were sharing joints together, in college.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 00:54:39'] The only thing I would add that hasn't been stated already is that I wouldn't have lump summed into it right now.  I would have preferred to build my position slowly over the course of the next few months and years.  Some will say "get in quickly before it goes up further", but given the state of the market and monetary policy right now IMO it's much more likely to see a major pullback than a major push forward. It may creep up steadily but a leap forward is highly unlikely IMO.  If you had saved some cash you could build your position slowly whether or not there's a big pullback.  And if there is one then that's the moment to go all in. If you're going to be dumping the same amount in every year as this year then it's not really a big deal, but if not you'll get much better returns if you're able to buy low instead of just buying immediately at any price.  Definitely keep your cash on hand IMO!

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 06:49:01'] $20,000 is a good base to start investing. Yes it's boring but you should really be putting the bulk of that into an ETF and use a smaller amount (10% or so) to stock pick with, and use that to learn. It's a lot easier to hold long term on a market tracking ETF than it is a company, even Apple. There is no harm in only buying single stocks with a couple hundred bucks at a time, instead of all in one one, to learn and have fun with while growing the rest in a diversified index fund. But your single stocks should almost be more 'play money' especially since you're new to this.Im around your age with close to $200,000 invested and the cumulative amount Ive invested on single stocks is less than what you have on Apple
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 07:05:38'] Once Apple wins the app-store court battle with Epic, the stock will see a post-lawsuit bump.   Probably.......if they win (and it looks likely to go in Apple's favor IMO).   IDK about criminally underrated it appears more just as "not criminally over-rated", lol

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 09:18:32'] I had bought some apple too, because they are a giant right? But I ask myself, what new things have they come out with in the last 10 years? What new things does it seem like they are working on over the next 10 years? Popular Companies tend to start ‚Äî> grow rapidly ‚Äî> Stagnate (where I feel Apple is right now) ‚Äî> Decline and then they either innovate and reinvigorate they brand OR they get eaten alive by the competition. If Apple doesn‚Äôt innovate more and stop banking on people buying overpriced phones with minor improvements every year, I actually see them declining over the next 10 years. They need to innovate more into the streaming service arena or the gaming arena or the music arena or something. Without innovation they will get overtaken by someone else (Google? Facebook? Amazon? Microsoft?) it‚Äôs possible.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 10:07:30'] Good. I own some too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-01 12:28:00'] Honestly, I am in the exact same boat (almost). I am 27 and last week I decided to give stocks a go. My initial idea was to buy some shares of ATVI (Activision) as tomorrow TBC comes out and on 2.08 they will release their earnings for Q2, which should be pretty positive as classic WoW had a huge success and TBC should follow. Moreover, at the end of the year Diablo 2 resurrected comes out, which should also be a tremendous success.However, I did not trust my instinct, as I am new and just purchased, like you, shares of AAPL @ 127 (tho I bought 2 shares not shares worth of 20k, so I guess we are not in the same boat but maybe I am in a canoe, next to your boat).Anyways, I still think AAPL is a safe bet and if it keeps dropping, I will just buy some more to average out.

In fact after 8 of the last 10 quarterly reports, despite beating analyst expectations, stock dipped on average 5-10%The Wall St analysts always explain this away by saying that AAPL is always "overvalued" therefore no matter how much profit they make or what new technology they come out with, there's going to be very little correlation between performance and stock price.As a long term buy and hold it's probably OK but honestly there's a lot better buy and holds out there

Not only that but there have been 4 or 5 stock splints since the beginning. The stock would really be worth thousands per share if it hadn't. Just like Amazon. So you didn't get some killer deal. Sorry to harsh your buzz.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 05:28:52'] Again the economy showed its relative strength. Frequent rate hikes since March of last year were supposed to create a recession, but so far that didn‚Äôt happen, and may not happen. However, some weakness is expected. The markets probably will move sideways for the next few months. Will the Fed start rate cut on September? It is unlikely we will see any rate cut this year, given the stubborn high inflation which is much higher than the Fed‚Äôs target of 2%.

POST_TEXT: b'Just a simple generic question.  Apple was trading at $124 after the split then went down to $100 before obviously taking off.     Tesla traded around $442 right after the split then dropped to $370.  Both of these split in August of 2020.   It seems like most companies see some kind of wild price movement around the time of announcing and actually splitting.  Did they announce the split along with kick ass earnings to soften the blow the stock price?   If someone was planning on already starting a position, would it be better to start now or wait till after the split and things settle down?  Just looking for opinions.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 18:19:46'] I was one of the naysayers when TSLA, AAPL and NVDA split was announced. Now I am a believer because people are fucking stupid. Fundamentally it changes nothing, but more retail interest will now come.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 18:23:29'] Yeah I do. Stock splits cause euphoria over no fundamental change. Then the correction happens.But Apple and TSLA ran into split and died on the actual split. Google doesn't split till July. Don't try to short preemptively. Also, by July a 20% correction might still be higher than the price now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 06:15:41'] Maybe. Psychologically something like this might happen. Yesterday I have one share that was $2750.  Now it‚Äôs $3000. After the split I have 20 shares of $150 each. Maybe I‚Äôll sell one and the value of the 19 shares I have left is still more than I had in my 1 share yesterday. So I guess the chances of selling pressure post-split will be dependent on the run up pre split. With AAPL and TSLA I do believe it led to the a position trimming psyche with retail post-split. And the share price is determined by the marginal buyer/seller
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 18:25:54'] Only reason Tesla went down was because they weren't going to be added to the S&P500 .. That was the rumour and that's why they went down post split .. Apple I don't know why they did but it was a grind .. But apple did run up a whole bunch before the split as did Tesla so maybe that's why ..

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 19:39:05'] I don't think it'll decrease too much but it will definitely trade within a range for awhile before the next leg up. There will be too many outstanding shares and some institutional investors may dump some of their shares (although I honestly think that's a dumb move considering Google's earnings power and growth). I think Apple was range bound also for several months after it split a year ago.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 20:08:19'] Tesla and Apple ran up when the split was announced and then went down a little. Nvidia ran up into the split and ran up after the split. Buy the company if you still think it‚Äôs undervalued or don‚Äôt buy it if you think it‚Äôs overvalued, pretty simple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 22:05:44'] I'm buying before, and I will be buying after if it drops. Just like I did for AAPL and NVDA. I still have a good 20 years in my investment journey so it doesn't matter much.

POST_TEXT: b'Most of the attention has focused on the companys App Store, but the case could also allege that Apples hardware harms competitors beyond app developers.\n\nThe company is currently appealing the outcome of its battle with Fortnite developer Epic Games.

Bearish news that brings down inflation has pumped the market on multiple occasions. Usually this happens the day after a large panic dump. I believe the market will realize the bullishness of the impending recession at market open. Futures are already green. \n\nToday and Friday will be an extremely powerful bullish rally. Not only because this inflation crushing recession bank earnings are going to light the fuse to the moon. \n\nJPM and mega banks have received billions in new deposits.

It is true that rate hikes cycle is ending soon but whether there will be rate cuts or not by EOY remains a big debate. Fed is not forced to make cuts unless if something breaks. I am bullish but not at S&P 500 4100-4200. I have been buying conservatively below 4000. I agree that there are no big catalysts in the near term that will break the market. But when recession hits, it happens fast. You will see quick increase in unemployment, drop in consumer spending and more collapses in banks and small companies. Nobody will able to time the recession perfectly.&#x200B;P.S. Your JPM call option is pure gamble trade before earnings and has nothing to do with your personal analysts.

He didn't just say something controversial, he put his company in the middle of a political war that has very high emotions, and sided with the side who do not like electric vehicles, almost to a violent level.  He also proved he was an inept leader with Twitter.  Unless he steps down, I think Tesla has permanent scars.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 21:32:28'] This is really good evaluation of the company. I feel like so much of what‚Äôs posted about Tesla is so tied to general consensus rather than factual sense. Not that I‚Äôm saying anything that the CEO is doing is good, but this gives a wider view on the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:41:06'] Elon does know majority of the Tesla buyers are liberals right?.The redneck/altright pick up driving crowd is not his demographic for Tesla but maybe Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:06:17'] Jesus, why are there so many posts about TSLA lately? I suspect unfortunate bag holders think they can save the stock by pumping it on Reddit. There are over 2500 stocks listed on the Nasdaq alone. No need to obsess over one of them
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:18:55'] Didn't Elon predict potentially an eps of 0 in the next year? Reduced margin, reduced volume in all markets.If that's true is that built as a bear case of this model?You have not speculated on the fallout of brand destruction due to becoming increasingly unhinged on Twitter, and specifically toxic to liberals with money, his primary sales demographic. Let's say 1 in 10, 2 in 10, or 5 in 10 customers are now compelled to choose a competitor; how does this affect Tesla's ability to generate revenue and profit?Your bear case is very mild. If even 2 in 10 customers are turned away and gross margin drops by 50%, this is starting to become a calamity. There is potentially far more risk that this post assumes.There are many anecdotal reports of people embarrassed to drive Tesla's or are no longer interested in buying. The evidence will be in the next 2-3 quarterly reports.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:30:37'] Why invest in a company that is now split by political ideology? Regardless of where YOU stand on the political landscape, it's about the consumers buying the product and if half of them aren't buying it because they don't support extreme right ideology means you split the market in half. IMO, TSLA is the worst investment to have, to be holding, to get into. I rather invest in a company that caters to everyone. Also, the clock is ticking. Manufacturers are catching up to EV. TSLA is no longer the only manufacturer anymore and it's hilarious to think otherwise.In addition to manufacturers catching up, battery power and infrastructure isn't catching up to speed. I highly doubt the EV shift is happening at the designated time frames they desired it to be here at. It'll prolong ICE and make TSLA harder to invest in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:03:27'] good bear case.  I wouldn't buy unless its under $20 a share.  its a car company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:22:20'] I can sum this up much easier: Elon pissed off his leftist base by buying Twitter. Tesla is going down much much more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:53:52'] I cant help but think there are enough funds that are counting on TSLA price not to drop much further.. but I've been wrong before. Add to that the fallout if it did happen to drop another 30-40%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:45:09'] A good company does not mean it‚Äôs a good stock. I think Tesla as a company is executing and the last few years the stock was overbought just like everything else. Look at all mega tech and high PE companies. They are all adjusting their earnings and cutting staff. I think I heard it at the Compound and Friends but they likened Tesla to Cisco from dot com. Cisco was and it still is a profitable company but they never reached their ATH due to a ridiculous high valuation it had during the bubble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:57:02'] The cars are superb (QC issues notwithstanding).The tech is outstanding.Their rapid recharging infrastructure is the literal archetype of an ideal charging network.They've pushed legacy manufacturers into finally developing ground-up EVs.Unfortunately, their CEO is a bellend. I'm glad I sold my model 3 last October. I had to get a van (electric) anyway, but everything Musk has done over the last 3 months has made me ashamed to be associated with the brand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:32:11'] High quality writingGg
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:55:58'] I‚Äôm not even going to add on Elon‚Äôs recent moves. This breezes over the fact commodities required to produce these cars at a scale of their growth with more competition in their space is going to drastically reduce profit. This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I‚Äôm very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn‚Äôt levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can‚Äôt predict. I think recently you‚Äôve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore.

You didn't even mention the slew of lawsuits the company is facing such as the self-driving feature plowing into people or the car accelerating wildly!There are a lot of things that Tesla has done, or is doing, that has been positive. Selling directly to consumers is awesome. Disrupting the automative industry that was a slave to fossil fuels and forcing automakers to consider EVs is great.But it's painfully obvious that the stock has been over-valued for years and this market correction was necessary
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:12:15'] Tesla paid for infrastructure and their factories when price for them was at an all time high. In contrast, Toyota acquired and built most of their land and fixed assets for factories after WW2 for literally nothing.Your first mover advantage for self driving is overstated. Tesla has spent the last 3 years developing self driving for cars without LIDAR or even radar. They are now behind Volvo and even Cadillac in this area. They also counted deposits for FSD as revenue without having delivered anything close to what was promised. This revenue should have been counted as unearned revenue, which is actually a liability on the balance sheet. Alot of what Tesla has done from an accounting standpoint is going to bite them in the ass, because it contributed to their stock valuation.Tesla‚Äôs moat and competitive advantages are vanishing quickly as legacy auto continues to move slowly but surely to catch up, taking as little risk as possible. There are huge headwinds for Tesla, and the added burden of twitter is coming at a very bad time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:59:56'] So tired of the TSLA bagholders. You guys were wrong, plain and simple. TSLA is a car company that can fall another 50% at least from here if (read: when) we enter a recession. The rest is just copium/hopium. Cut your bags.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:09:52'] Great analysis, very comprehensive and well done. Quick question/note, I assume the below is a typo - should be "cost disadvantage"?>You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost advantage, how do you cut them out of the deal?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:42:57'] Is your model assuming flat discount rate? My guess longterm discount rate will revert to mean. But I guess sustained 10% fed rate is also possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:15:00'] I really like this analysis - and I think you did a decent job to balance bullish and bearish indicators.For me the sweet spot to enter Tesla would have been below 100$ per share as I find it highly volatile and hard to predict where it will go (which is why I stayed clear of it so far - for bad and good depending on time). I‚Äôd maybe rethink if it hits 112$ now, or 110$ because of your analysis.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 20:13:32'] I got in at 48, I got out at 82.  To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.I will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.If I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.As such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.The only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.Even then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 00:38:10'] TSLA is still valued like a tech company despite only having a fancy autopilot. Over promising and under delivering are the two thing Elon Musk does the most regarding the companies he owns. January 2017 he said FSD would happen within 6 months. November 2017 he said a Tesla semi will be on the road in 2019. 2019 he said 1 million robo taxis on the road by 2020. Tesla will remain a car company selling cars, and it will probably not be able to justify its current market cap. There‚Äôs too many other choices for EVs and hybrids that people are choosing over Tesla now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 01:17:18'] People go on about Tesla‚Äôs valuation compared to legacy auto but all ignore their debt like VW‚Äôs $400b debt, Toyotas $293b debt, and their lousy margins.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 20:35:45'] Tesla FSD is not going to get any better any time soon. Robo Taxis were just a Pipe dream. Tesla is currently valued roughly 7x a regular car manufacturer.

POST_TEXT: b'https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-q2-earnings-stock-slips-after-mixed-results-213931097.html\n\nCostco (COST) posted fiscal second-quarter earnings results Thursday, March 2, after market close that mostly beat expectations. Shares were down more than 2% after the release.\n\nAs consumers sought out value and moved away from discretionary spending, the wholesale retailer saw a slight miss in quarterly revenue, coming in at $55.27 billion, but up 6.5% from a year ago. Meanwhile net sales saw a 6.5% increase, to $54.24 billion, up from $50.04 billion.\n\nHere\'s what Costco reported, compared to Wall Street estimates, based on Bloomberg consensus data:\n\nRevenue: $55.27 billion versus $55.58 billion expected\n\nAdjusted earnings per share: $3.30 versus $3.21 expected\n\nSame-store sales: up 6.8% versus up 6.16% expected\n\nUnited States: up 5.8% versus up 5.56% expected\n\nCanada: up 9.6% versus up 5.51% expected\n\nOther international: 9.5% versus up 7.10% expected\n\n"People are spending their doll'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 17:52:48'] I‚Äôm invested in Costco so I may be biased, but this reads like decent earnings and mainly hindered by macro factors. Would love different takes on it. (I‚Äôve held Costco for 3-4 years now and don‚Äôt think this changes that for me)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 21:29:58'] I love costco but I feel the 36PE ratio is a little steep. I am hoping they make a kirkland version with 30% less PE but the same quality.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 04:17:17'] Costco will likely be a stock that is always considered expensive compared to peers so probably best to judge it‚Äôs valuation based off it‚Äôs own history. So still expensive then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 18:01:36'] Hmmm, Costco still makes billions off membership fees, and gas.   The one place people would wanna spend money during inflation is warehouse style stores.  I can buy bulk items and stock up.  Cheaper than ShopRite and Walmart and Target.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 00:08:08'] COST is preeeetty expensive at these levels: [https://jmp.sh/wGvUdDYX](https://jmp.sh/wGvUdDYX)* For practically the last 10 years, the stock has traded above a conservative estimation of fair value* P/S LTM has never been higher* P/E LTM has never been higher* Margins are stable, that's a good sign* ROE and ROIC are pretty decently high* Outstanding shares are flatBottom line: if interest rates go down to where they have been in 2021, it might be OK to buy the stock when it dipsif they don't, you got an issue buying and holding at these prices

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 09:53:28'] No one knows. But I‚Äôll give my opinion based on TSLA expected growth. $100 was a great buying opportunity, and as long as the market sentiment stays half decent we won‚Äôt see those lows again. (I still think the market needs a good drop again tho). $120-145 is a decent buy range imo, given TSLA growth and ability to still pull in profits through difficult times. Their energy department is also growing fast than their vehicles, so we should start seeing some meaningful numbers from that by EOY. If you want to hold longterm, it‚Äôs probably okay but you might be underwater for a bit at these prices.

Apple has fallen 24.5% so far this year. Which investor do you agree with on AAPL?\n\nBuffett, Long AAPL\n\nBurry, Short AAPL'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 08:17:39'] Both are right. Buffet outlook is long term, very long term decades. He is right holding AAPL.Burry outlook is near term or short term. AAPL goes down with market. Burry May short Or buy puts on AAPL, while Buffet May buy/DCA AAPL shares.Burry outlook is traders attitude while Buffet is investors outlook.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 06:30:28'] Shorters usually try make money by closing before these companies recover. Even they say these are short term plays.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 08:13:52'] It‚Äôs pretty simple; short term short and long term long. Which is exactly the two types of investors that Burry and Buffett are, respectively.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 12:39:31'] I think they're both right.Burry is going to make money shorting Apple.  In the next few days it's going to continue to fall.  It was hesitant to falling before but now it has some room to fall.  Burry can cash out his shorts in a week or so and make a killing.Buffet is right long term.  Apple is going to recover.  They have some short term cost increases (chip shortages) and they're getting hit pretty hard in Europe with new laws that'll have some short term cost increases.  And the market for smart phones is going to decrease coming up.  But... they're still going to make money.  Air Pods will still be the world's #1 selling listening devices.  Apple Pay is becoming more and more people and their transactions business is only going to grow.Burry will sell his shorts in under a month.  Buffet will sell his position in 8 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 17:54:22'] Bury is a joke
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 07:47:48'] I don't ever short, personally. Too much gambling for my style of investing. Short-term I could very well see weakness in AAPL, however. In fact I feel like there should be more weakness to come. But you never know. Long-term I most definitely see AAPL push higher.At current prices, I'm not interested in AAPL. But if I had to choose whether to buy or short, I'd buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 14:35:22'] short short term long long term easy

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 13:12:03'] I think everyone in the comments is wrong.  Burry just posted a picture on twitter of the Books on his desk which include Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged and a whole bunch of buffet stuff including annual shareholder letters.In one of those Buffet shareletters somewhere, it says to never let one position get above 40% of a portfolio, and if it does sell because risk management.AAPL just became 47% of buffett's portfolio. - according to something I saw on twitter.  -correct me if I'm wrong.If that is true than, Buffet would be selling AAPL to bring it back down to 40%, and Burry as a Buffet watcher would know this.Burry is betting Buffet will sell to rebalance and bring down APPL's price.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-21 14:25:57'] Ignoring all the troubles they've clearly been having on this project seeing as it's like a decade old, I'm highly skeptical this is ever going to work out or be worthwhile for AAPL shareholders.There's a reason people call Tesla the Apple of the car industry. Tesla already has all the hype that Apple products usually get, just look around the Internet, if people talk about how they want to buy an EV in the future they talk about how they want to own a Tesla, especially the 'techie' crowd who are usually the first in line to buy Apple products on their release date.I just don't see Apple convincing the techie crowd that they have better EV's or EV tech then Tesla does. Think of it this way, if Tesla made their own smartphones, do you really think all that many Apple users would be willing to switch over to it no matter how much more advanced it might be than the iPhone? I don't, because that's the power of branding with these two companies.

There has been little technological innovation in the last few years, and very little technological invention in the last 50. Apple is out of ideas, so they make a car. Would be no different from Samsung making a radio. All this tech already exists, all they can try to do is improve inch by inch, but now it's more like millimeter by millimeter.

The opposite holds true; tech goes down faster and further than the broader market in bad times. The second absolute is that we are in bad times - Jerome Powell is trying to deliberately bring the market down. We can debate on if he should, but there is no debate on if he is trying to do this. \n\nThe list of absolutes could continue - but due to us beginning the on average worst month for the stock market - I am betting against Apple and am buying up AAPD. I hold 21 shares of AAPD and will be selling when Apple goes to $141 later this month. We will retest the June lows, and there is a good chance AAPL with slide to $130 again, more money for those of us who invest in AAPD. \n\nOther holdings: SQQQ, SDOW.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 14:39:40'] beginners should buy index funds to start. Check out VTI, or VYM for vanguard products. there are lots of similar ones out there. It lets you dip your feet in the water without exposing yourself to too much risk. You can get used to the idea of the share price fluctuating, without really getting into too much trouble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 18:31:16'] Invest in knowledge, LOTS OF IT, before you put money into any investments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 16:21:22'] You should definitely buy indexes before you consider buying individual stocks. Indexes contain the stocks you want already but will automatically diversify you. If you add $100 every paycheck to the index you don't have to worry about any fluctuations in the market. This is exactly how a 401k operates. You just need to be consistent over the course of 30+ years until retirement.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 22:47:06'] I know this won‚Äôt be a popular answer, but I would recommend first investing in a career. In order to maximize your returns from stocks, you‚Äôll need a pretty sizable amount of capital (i.e., it‚Äôs significantly easier for someone making $150k/year to become a millionaire from stocks than it is for someone making $50k/year). Take that $50-$100 extra you have and put it towards something that will help you get that six figure job, whether it‚Äôs a skilled trade, engineering, etc.I‚Äôm making the assumption that you haven‚Äôt yet started your career journey, so if that is not the case I apologize.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 19:36:03'] I‚Äôd suggest DCA investing in index funds until you understand how to pick stocks. Stick picking is not as simple as buying the stock of a brand you enjoy. It means valuing a company, analyzing financial statements, studying fundamentals, etc. Until you have a strong understanding of stock picking, I‚Äôd avoid individual stocks. That said, if you really want to study how to pick stocks, read The Intelligent Investor; it‚Äôs a fantastic book that should I still a healthy mindset in you. Study the styles of successful investors such as Buffett, Graham, Lynch, Greenblatt, Munger, and so on. Find a strategy that works for you and stick with it. People like to claim it‚Äôs impossible to beat the market, but all the people I mentioned above demolished the index over many years. Research shows which strategies work and which don‚Äôt. Rather than reinvent the wheel, implement strategies that have a proven track record of performing well (preferably outperforming indices) and providing a safety of principal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 20:20:31'] Investing is the business of dreams. Nobody wants to own x shares of blank, people just want to get rich so they can live their dream life. With that being said, your first investment should be yourself. Grind down any debt with a bad rate, invest in your education and skills, and lastly establish a 6-15 month emergency fund. Once that is done I recommend your first $15-20K go into a S&P 500 index (ticker VOO or SPY). This will give you exposure to the top 500 American companies. I have my entire 401K in VFIAX which is a similar fund through Vanguard. Now comes the fun part. You have skills giving you income and you have a little bite of every delicious apple on the money tree. Now is where you differentiate. Create an investing thesis. That is something you think will drive growth for years to come. I recommend something in your field of expertise, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Once you established a thesis, go through the stocks that are doing business adjacent to that thesis. Look at what they are priced at (P/E), market cap, free cash flow, revenue, net profit, insider buys/sells, general trends/sentiment, investor ratings, and I could go on. Try to find stocks that fit your appetite for risk, and match your temperament. I was buying GameStop at $7-16/share. But I wasn‚Äôt emotionally ready to sell when it peaked at over $400/share. I ended up selling around $60, over 4x my money, but I could have had so much more. You have to learn from your mistakes. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 01:22:46'] I have been a Schwab customer for over 35 years. Great company with great representatives and excellent free research tools. I suggest you buy a Schwab mutual fund or ETF tied to the S&P 500. That way you will have a nicely diversified holding that tracks the major companies in America. After you learn how to research individual stocks and decide what kind of investor you want to be, ie. Growth oriented, value oriented, both, etc., you can start adding individual companies to your portfolio. Investing can be rewarding and educational as well as fun as long as you understand there will never be guarantees with your purchases. While it is not gambling, there is risk. Doing research and carefully choosing your companies will minimize that risk. The key is to keep adding to your portfolio on a regualr and consistent basis no matter what the market is doing. That is called dollar cost averaging. Hope this helps, getting started can be overwhelming. Mark
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 16:17:07'] \*Not financial advice\*1 - You need to get experience.  Find some trustworthy mentors who have a similar trading style as yourself. I can DM you who I follow if you like.  Search You Tube, talk to some financial advisors near where you live, read some articles, etcI, personally, would buy XYLD and use the dividend to purchase additional shares each month.  It's dividend is currently at 13% (If I could go back and invest $50-$100 per check)Next, I would learn how to sell covered calls, and paper trade stocks like TSLA, AAPL, META, GOOG.  In about a year or two you will have a good Idea on how the process works and how you can make money if the stock is going up, going down, or sideways.  I don't believe the stock market outpaces inflation and taxes, so my strategy may be very different than your thinking.Here is some good advice I received, through various learning sources, over the past year:\- Don't trust any advice or advisor.  Take in what they say, learn how to do a fundamental analysis of a company for it's future cash flow, and make your own decision.  You are the one taking all the risk\- There isn't a big pool of money waiting for you to get your portion.  A very large number of companies will fail each year, and a large number of companies cannot outpace inflation and taxes.  learn how to be market neutral.\- if you aren't willing to put in a lot of time understanding the market and companies, you will most likely fail.  May get lucky from time to time, but over the long term, doomed.  If you don't want to put in the time, stick to what makes you money and focus on that.  Learn to save, and find a financial advisor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 09:48:58'] Stay away from individual stocks.  The sticks that did great the last 10 years likely won't be the same stocks that do great the next 10 years.Stick with diversified ETFs like VTO and VTI.  These ETFs beat stock pickers and actively managed funds 90% of the time over the 10 or 20 year period.At the same time, build up your savings so you have at least 3 months of expenses in a safe high yield savings account.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 16:32:14'] Pick companies not stocks
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 19:13:32'] dont just blindly buy amazon or apple or google or even VOO or VTI as people here are saying. Learn how ETFs work first before you buy one so you know about how the indexes move the market before you buy some of these bigger companies. Learn to look at valuations and ask yourself a simple question: Why am I investing? Are you wanting additional income stream, multiply your money, insulate yourself until retirement from inflation, make a living on it, or all of the above? If you let us know what you want, people can maybe point you in the right direction. Some of those things are harder than others but at least you can know what kind of strategies people employ. ex: People who tell you to just buy VOO or VTI are not doing you a favor if you want additional income streams.Personally, the biggest companies and even monopolies will always be unable to hold their edge into perpetuity. Just look at the East India Trading company or the railroads of the past. Therefore, google, microsoft, amazon etc aren‚Äôt great investments to me bc they will neither give me stable dividends, 2-3x my money, nor are they guaranteed to stay as mega corporations until I retire. I would rather focus on speculation and dividend generation. But I know that is an unpopular take here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 15:44:19'] I don‚Äôt think we are in a dip. Imho valuations are very high (too high), they‚Äôre still 20-25% above historic norms. People had to pile into equities because there wasn‚Äôt any money to be made in fixed income for the last 15 years and now that has changed. A person nearing retirement can get the 4% they need with CDs and doesn‚Äôt need to be or want to be in equities.Valuations are too high still - the market wants to run but smart money should be in short term bonds and CDs imho

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 21:26:25'] Okay this is how I see it and a lot of young people don‚Äôt agree but I do. When you‚Äôre young you can take more risk cause you‚Äôre young and have time. If you‚Äôre older, you want to be safe and buy the spy or qqq cause it‚Äôs a really safe equity. If you‚Äôre making that little amount of money, no offense, but that‚Äôs not really going to compound or do anything sognificant to help reach financial freedom. This is what young people don‚Äôt get. They‚Äôre investing 1200 a year for 5 years.. that‚Äôs only 5-6k. One bad accident happens and you have to tap into that bag and now you‚Äôre back to 0‚Ä¶Imagine if you had taken risk and bet $1000 or even more on one bet, and it pays of 100x an snow you have 100k. Compared to the 100 a month into a low yield low risk asset. Yeah, that‚Äôs okay if you have a million dollars. Most millionaires and billionaires do that. They buy low risk (or even no risk stuff like bonds) which yield 2-3-4% and they‚Äôre happy with that. Cause they‚Äôre so rich. But you‚Äôre not rich my friend. You can be if you make the right financial decisions. Don‚Äôt do what all the young people do and not really take risk. Right now there‚Äôs a lot of opportunities. Just be patient and know that it won‚Äôt happen in a day. Must be patient. That‚Äôs the most important thing in investments. There‚Äôs some people that have been doing this for a very long time. They know patience. Young people don‚Äôt and blow up their accounts cause they want to get rich tomorrow. No. That‚Äôs not how investing works. Then they say everything is a scam and capitalism is a scam. No. That person was just foolish. Don‚Äôt be foolish like the majority of young people, and don‚Äôt buy $100 of a etf every month, cause you‚Äôre not investing millions of dollars. When you have millions of dollars or even a good paying salary, okay start, but right now with your lower wage job, research hot sectors, ask people that seem like they have insider info, and speculate into a company with a lot of potential. Like Tesla 10 years ago. Or Amazon 20 yrs ago. Or apple. Or Bitcoin 10 years ago. Those all 1000x +

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 08:54:08'] I agree with the recommendation many are making of VOO. although I'd if if you want to add a very slight amount of added volatility for a fair chance at slightly better returns, you might split your money between VOO and VTI. VOO just invests in the top 500 companies by market cap, while VTI includes small- and mid-cap companies, which many people think are going to over-perform in the next year or so. But VTI is still a broad ETF and brings the protections against major loss relative to picking individual stocks like VOO does.

So many people on this sub are obsessed with VOO but that is NOT the answer. 401k employer match is literally free money and if you‚Äôre not doing that then that‚Äôs dumb. A Roth IRA is taxed up front which means more money in the end for you. So don‚Äôt just start yoloing into stocks or Bitcoin or VOO. Do those AFTER you do a 401k and Roth.
