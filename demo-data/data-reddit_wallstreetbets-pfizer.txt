POST_TEXT: b'*Guys*. Pfizer (PFE) is scheduled to report its Q1 2023 results on tomorrow morning and I fully expect to see higher levels, with its revenue and earnings exceeding the consensus estimates. \n\nLet\'s for a second consider the "pandemic products." Their Covid-19 vaccine and the antiviral pill will definitely see a significant drop in sales. The combined revenue from these two products is estimated to be $21.5 billion in 2023, compared to $56.7 billion in 2022. However, if we were to exclude the Covid-19 products, the companys sales of everything else will likely trend higher. Not only do I expect PFE to post upbeat Q1 results, analysts do find that the stock is undervalued-  I\'ll get into this further. \n\n**Covid-19 products down, but who cares?**\n\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PFE/no-login-required/D048UezA/Pfizer-PFE-Earnings-Preview-PFE-Stock-Likely-To-Trade-Higher-Due-To-FY-2023Q1-Revenues-And-Earnings-Likely-Beating-Expectations?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230430) est'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 12:58:22'] Unless we have another Pandemic between now and tomorrow, PFIZER is a FAT SELL. Their bread a butter products are aging out, and the patents they have are being crushed by competition in the ED and Thyroid space.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:25:50'] how'd you have 680 shares of pltr at 31 a share and *not bought more when it was 5*? 👀you're in a boat a lot of people *were* in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:13:07'] Nice bag, PLTR gang rise up 💎🙌😎
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:04:49'] So your plan is to sell your existing stock at a huge loss just to buy a stock that’s at an 8 month high?  Nice work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:25:49'] If you’re going to sell at a loss at least sell covered calls at .3 delta, 30-45 days out, buying back at 50% profit and repeating that until they get called away. With pltrs upward momentum I bet call side premium is juicy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:23:51'] Still holding mine at $28 avg
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:05:02'] I'm holding pltr, I think it's gonna have a nice lil squeeze in the next month or so but that's just my thought.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:35:52'] Buy high Sell low. This is the way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:09:03'] Regarding PLTR, MA50 crossed over MA200 in April and it has been going up ever since. RSI is still high looking at the 3-month chart, indicating over-bought, but it is consolidating and looks pretty good.I hold PLTR as well, and with the AI hype, I will continue to hold and accumulate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:01:46'] If your Pfizer shares don't get your shares up within 3 hours, please call your brokerage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:40:34'] God this guy is the definition of fomo. What’s to buy in an already pumped to death tsla. How about selling and staying liquid. Wow amazes me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:06:35'] It's not a loss if you don't sell. Both have potential. Ride em cowboy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:31:53'] i think PLTR has a better chance of squeezing than Pfizer, pfizer is a dead dog walking
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:09:50'] You should sell covered calls against Pfizer

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:34:20'] So you definitely shouldn’t have bought to shares and would’ve been better buying NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:59:37'] Went from 200k down to about 38k now I'm at about 156k holding alot of bags like chwy, space,tlry,pltr, sofi, hims,pfizer, gmbl,amc,sq  about 60k in losses or more

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:17:16'] To me pltr qualifies as a meme stock. I see no real value in it. If I wasn't a gambling man I'd say buy shares of something steady and just hold... but my other side say that nvda has some life left....buy calls close to the money and make your money back. Sell. Then diversify after you're even or up. But don't listen to me. Every time I buy the market inverse me

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 19:32:43'] The real problem is it doesn't prevent you from contacting or spreading COVID, sooo it's not actually a vaccine. I feel sorry for anyone that took them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 08:09:01'] Didn't see that coming......at all. CEO must need that fat bonus. Perfect timing since the non-elected CDC recommends your children get the "emergency" approved vaccine in order to attend school.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 08:48:35'] Kinda coincidental that the CDC just just unanimously  recommended that kids get the jab with the rest of their required  shots for school even though they have the smallest infection rate.

They are raising the price is order to screw over the health insurance companies, not the individual.   When your premiums go up and you complain about the cost of insurance, you don’t complain to big pharma about it.  This is the strategy that all of pharma uses, make the insurance company eat the cost, when the individual actually feels it through premium increases next year, they complain to their legislators about the health plan and not pharmaceuticals.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:10:05'] I always love the people who are so very against all forms of government regulation but then act so shocked when unfettered capitalism causes drug prices to rise to the point where people have to ration insulin or go without entirely.For instance, an EpiPen is $0.75 worth of epinephrine in a spring-loaded syringe.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:36:51'] Well this should put the bullshit “recouping R&D costs” excuse to bed. They’ve made 10s of billions in profits off of these vaccines already.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 10:39:27'] They received millions from American taxpayers (aka the middle class)to develop that vaccine.  Now they sell for a profit.  In Australia it will cost $2.  Similar story with prep HIV prevention medication.  AOC did a whole investigation on that and it went no where.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 18:58:51'] Per the article "Those purchases have included more than 500 million doses from Pfizer. The first 100 million cost around $20 a dose, thanks to an earlier agreement in which the US government invested $1.95 billion in vaccine production. The remaining doses were bought for around $30 each.""The company announced on Oct. 20 that it intends to sell the covid vaccine, marketed under the brand name Comirnaty, for $110 to $130 per dose."So I guess if you squint at it maybe but it's more like 600% which is still nuts but not 10,000% nuts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 19:02:13'] What's 10000% of free?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 19:24:23'] 10,000% markup on production costs. How much did they invest to actually develop the vaccine and get it out to the public?Not defending blatant profiteering, which does happen - but has anyone done the full numbers?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 20:23:48'] I believe that the original deal was that pfe would sell at cost to get the vaccine out and to the country. They had a deal in place for x amount of doses wether it worked or not. Luckily it did. The discount always had an expiration  date.   they are no longer required to sell at the original contract price. I also believe that there is still an agreement in place with insurance companies so that you can get a vaccine at no cost. Do your DD though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 21:21:27'] Just for comparison: “The cost of a flu shot without insurance will depend on where you go and the kind of shot you need, but it typically ranges from $25 to $110 out of pocket.”https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/flu-vaccination/flu-shot-cost-without-insurance

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 08:57:07'] How can a vaccine that wears off in less than a year be on the schedule?  You would have to take it yearly. The flu shot isn’t on the schedule.

I wore the mask (even when the science behind it was rather flimsy). I did the whole six feet bullshit. I wiped down all of my groceries with bleach water after I got them at the store. I sanitized my cash and the contents of my wallet. I gave all off my coins to the charity jar for a year, so I wouldn't have to sanitize them.All of that and I tested positive for Covid not once, not twice, but three fucking times. You'll forgive me if I no longer have much faith in their "vaccine". I won't be paying for any more of it out of my pocket (especially not at a 10,000% markup).

The physical materials to make the vaccine dose is obviously very cheap but there are other costs that made creating it like R&D that made it much more expensive and “markup” is misleading here.

Everyone always forgets that the vast majority of pharmaceutical R&D results in nothing of value. It's that small amount that does that needs to justify the cost of developing it in the first place. But sure let's only focus on the cost of the end product, not creating it in the first place...

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:35:16'] What a moronic clickbait headline. It’s an IP business. The cost is in prior investment at high risk, and no one would try to do this without a payout. Windows marginally costs $0.05 a copy and yet Microsoft charges $400 or something (while investing billions to make it good). That the marginal vaccine dose costs $1 a dose and sells for over $100 to market, who cares? It’s an irrelevant comparison. This is the case for basically every new drug. If not for IP being valuable, no one would develop such IP, and for every moderna there are thousands of biotech corpses that tried in hopes of such an outcome and failed. Moderna might be another if not for their tech happening to be well developed and a good match for the problem that happened (along with the CEO dropping everything to focus on it). Pharma as an industry isn’t that profitable, hence questionable market caps vs societal importance. Compare that to local hospitals which generate absurd economic profits via market power paid out to hospital administrators, real estate, and doctors that have certain specialties.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:39:21'] What it cost to produce now isn't an issue, how much did it cost them in research and salaries rent bills all those months to get it right? The fact it cost now doest make them look money until they recoup all the expenses 1st.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 14:51:56'] If I am understanding the video correctly, it is showing Pfizer plans to mutate Covid in order to make vaccines for said mutations.The problem with this is two-fold. One, there is no way a greedy Exec is gonna allow money to be wasted on a vaccine that MAY be necessary. Two, to guarantee such a plan works, you need to release the virus as well, thats an act of terrorism and yeah if Pfizer is planning a dumbass idea like that, they should get in deep shit.Honestly just sounds like bs to further put down mRNA technology. mRNA tech for vaccines is better than the traditional inactivated virus because you are dealing with less proteins, so less off-target effects from your immune system. So that's why we use it now. mRNA is also very transient, being cleared by the liver of itself and the lipid nanoparticles that encapsulates it. However, the dude is probably referring to using machine learning yo predict mutations are make libraries ahead of time, no mutations need to be injected into Covid.I worked with mRNA for 3 years, so I know my shit, more or less.TLDR: Sounds like misconstrued science, likely referencing machine learning predictions of and not real mutations. mRNA good, typical conspiracy, see yall Monday.

This could be due to many factors, such as anxiety about the future or uncertainty about what will happen next. However, one thing is for sure: stocks are currently volatile and anyone investing should be cautious. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:09:22'] Volatility in the stock market should always be taken into consideration when investing. With so many factors potentially affecting the state of the market, such as anxiousness and uncertainty, it's best to remain mindful of your position. Investing with caution is critical to minimizing risks and possibly seeing rewards in financial growth further down the line. Don't let the erratic swings of stocks accumulate too much trouble for you, take a deep breath and stick to the basics of investing safely.

I don't know about profitability (they must have spent a lot in trials and it's not oncology care with steady high income), but I know it's a saviour pill for most and that may inflate the stock price, at least briefly.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 18:50:30'] According to the article, the company Pfizer alleges to have a history of trying to poach clients is Xencor Inc., XNCR . Chun Xiao Li, the former employee who stole \~12,000 files from Pfizer, appears to work for them now.If the allegations are true, whether she did it for the her new company or not, having that much confidential data stolen could have big consequences for Pfizer.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 08:02:28'] So. Seems there are several comparable studies. The 40x is for antibody interaction that scales badly with protection. Some protection will still be there as the antibodies work much weaker but still do something. Note that boostered individuals have up to 25x the antibiodies in comparison to 2 shots.It seems that this means. 1. Boostered persons will have some protection. 2. Biontech will need to produce an updated booster shot for Omicron. Likely for ready February or March because they can use the mRNA tech to update the spike prot sequence.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 09:14:07'] FDA approval doesn't really mean anything.Just last week Pfizer recalled batches of one of their drugs called Chantix which was approved by the FDA in May 2006, over 15 years ago.**"Aug 13 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Friday it is recalling four additional lots of its anti-smoking treatment, Chantix, after finding elevated levels of cancer-causing agents called nitrosamines in the pills."**[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-expands-recall-anti-smoking-drug-over-carcinogen-presence-2021-08-13/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-expands-recall-anti-smoking-drug-over-carcinogen-presence-2021-08-13/)Add that to the list of 35 other drugs recalled years, sometimes decades after FDA approval:[https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/fda-approved-prescription-drugs-later-pulled-from-the-market/](https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/fda-approved-prescription-drugs-later-pulled-from-the-market/)[https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/risky-drugs-why-fda-cannot-be-trusted](https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/risky-drugs-why-fda-cannot-be-trusted)
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 07:33:11'] I mean, this couldnt have been a surprise to anyone? Several million if not billion of shots registered with few side-effects. Should already be calculated into the stock price at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 08:46:38'] Sadly I only have enough for a fractional share. Hopefully I can still see some gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 08:18:43'] The first question to ask is why now? If the vaccines work, and the pandemic is almost over, why approve it now?If the vaccines don't work, and the mutations bypass it, why approve this old version now?The only answer is this paves the way for at least some kind of mandatory vaccination that "emergency use" didn't allow for, though it's probably unconstitutional anyway, they could sell it to the public more easily.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 11:28:58'] Although this takes some wind out of the sails from antivaxxers, I doubt it will change anything as far as vaccination rates go. In fact, I see a backlash on vaccines from both sides lately, even Bill Maher said Friday he doesn't want to get a 3rd shot.

It vaporized the girl as it punched right through her, it barely slowed before cutting through a structural support beam in the school as if it were a nuclear powered angle grinder. the sheer weight of this historical nut, combined with the total destruction of everything in its path caused the school to collapse, and every female in the state of illinois became pregnant with my children.

The rate is statistically 0.) other companies are coming out with covid vax’s, the market will be flooded. Everyone and anyone who wanted to get vaxed are vaxed. poor countries are all thats left, and theres no money there. Their dick pill patents ran out. Oh, and they are the most scandalous company in the history of the US. The only upside they have is their covid treatment pill, which I’ve heard mixed reviews on. Pfizer = Pfeces

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-20 23:07:31'] From a paper about FDA approval and stock price:“CONCLUDING COMMENTSThis research shows a positive correlation between FDA drug approvals and a company’s market share price for instances in which the subject drug is either a new remedy or an improvement above existing remedies available in the marketplace. A “blockbuster” classification is viewed by investors as a growth opportunity for the company. As such, the market responds strongly by increasing that company’s stock price. There is also a favorable correlation between a Priority Review Drug classification and increases to a company’s stock price. However, as expected, a Priority Review Drug approval’s impact on stock price is not as strong as that of the blockbuster drug. Lastly, there was no observable correlation between a FDA approval of a Standard Review Drug classification and the companies’ stock price. The market exhibited neither a positive or negative stock price reaction to those “lesser drugs”. These results support the conclusion that FDA approval does indeed affect a pharmaceutical company’s stock price. The differentiating criterion is the classification level of the new drug, and how investors and the market in general perceive the value each respective approval to the recipient company. Drugs representing more significant advancement over existing therapies cause larger”http://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/182804.pdf

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 06:19:43'] Well... Despite the FDA panel recommendations, the  "subscription" requiring 2 shots a year for everyone  for the rest of their lives was approved by the CDC,  sounds pretty bullish I guess. (And also terrifying on a human level o_0)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 18:13:16'] That’s why I’m bearish on Pfizer
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 04:48:17'] Can someone please explain why this stock never moves more than a couple bucks while Moderna swings like crazy?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 07:41:32'] What a way to make money. Create a vaccine that have the goalposts change on what it does but get government daddy to force it and they use tax dollars to buy it hence the company makes billions.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 22:15:57'] Hence the push for " everyone to be vaccinated for THIER safety"

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 22:00:07'] But get your vaccine for $100 worthless savings bond, or lose your job. Oh, and if you have short or long term side effects, tough luck because Pfizer isn’t liable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 11:41:02'] Just a daily reminder for everyone: it’s priced in
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 08:33:58'] The Covid vaccine was President Trumps Revenge. He figured out what the Democrats and Soros were doing and created a Poison Pill. If he was re elected he would stop the development of the killer vaccines. If he was cheated and lost the election, he would allow the heart stoppers to be dispersed to the stupid Americans that voted for old joe. Ivermectin, Zinc, vitamins D, C, Multi, Tylenol and Quercetin. All inexpensive and it works. Fuck Pfizer and the Vaccine Mandates.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-03 06:01:41'] By definition aren't vaccines I wish they'd change the wording lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 18:53:52'] Pfizer wont get a penny from me towards the vaccine...

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 06:59:07'] The key for Moderna's vaccine is that the storage is above freezing temp. For both producers, they will be supply constrained anyways so it doesn't even fucking matter if there's a 10% efficacy difference, everyone will just get their hands on what they can. If you're a third party company looking to buy the vaccine patents, Moderna is the way to go.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 07:04:32'] Moderna and Pfizer's vaccines each have different cold-chain storage requirements and are ordered in different quantities. We'll need both types to get everyone vaccinated, it's not an either or scenario.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 09:31:27'] CureVac though... they have the only vaccine capable of being stored at room temperature for 24 hrs and stable in a refrigerator.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 09:40:53'] The DD you need is that both manufacturers will sell 100% of their stock in 2021 because of shortages everywhere.There won't be enough vaccine for everyone to have a shot, doesn't matter if it's 90% or 95%.

It appears rumors might well be true and the Crap has begun to hit the fan. Apparently, In a twist of irony, the govt of Wuhan (where covid started) announced that they would have to make cuts to people's medical benefits (I.E. their equivalent of Medicare) and it has sparked mass protests outside govt buildings.

There’s a HUGE leap from that assessment, to saying the U.S. is broke…and then extrapolating from that the very worst.If you’re looking for a story to support your previous argument, congratulations, it looks like you found it.  One thing we do know about China is that the real estate troubles didn’t crush them the way many expected.  Two, while for years the US had extremely low interest rates and was printing money — which contributed significantly to our current problems — China had a much more conservative fiscal policy and now has a significantly lower inflation.

It's all they've ever done.>*Brought to you by Pfizer*
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-18 06:08:46'] It has good dividend, low debt and cheap PE. Has many other drugs other than the vaccine, I think it’s a good value company. Maybe it’s down because it was a COVID stock.

Biontech is also a long term bet - maybe not at current levels but once it has stabilised, they will have a golden path due to dedicated, visionary and professional top management. Being a great company is all that matters in the long run

POST_TEXT: b"TLDR: Simple. Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. \n\nIf you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)\n\nPfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. \n\nThey are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). \n\nPfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \n\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. \n\nAnoth"

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:20:49'] 38C in a month should make money, however I have a fear that the health sector is about to either stall or take a steaming shit on everyone's portfolio.Corona was about the only thing making hospitals and drug companies money for the last couple months and a bunch of jobs were lost which will take a long time to recover, which means slower access to shit. Now the public has just said through rioting that there are no more fucks to be given bout the 'rona as all fucks are given towards police brutality. XLV took a dip but was right back up to ATH before one could blink. It out performed everything except recently tech overtook it. No more 'rona checks are coming, Fed isn't handing anyone money after the riots and now the news doesn't give a shit about COVID as it's protest/riot coverage 24/7, and come July those extra unemployment checks stop. People will no longer have health coverage nor money to pay for shit. The Fed is now less focused on Corona and the pressure on the FDA to get it done disappears and they go back to their normal, glaciers move faster, speed. Plus R&D is about to be fucked up for a year as no college labs, now this may improve the budgets as R&D is the biggest expense, but also means nothing in the pipeline to cover the drops when patents expire and their shit becomes generic.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:55:27'] Got in earlier before it dropped ~6%. $45 c for 9/18.Thinking we might see a slight reversal on SPY so I’ll hold off and grabbing a few more contracts.Pfizer has multiple candidates and agreements already in place to scale the fuck out of this vaccine if one of the candidates moves forward. Even Fauci has said Pfizer has as good a shot as Moderna to complete it.This has slipped by people because unlike Moderna who’s releasing literally any updates, Pfizer is being tight lipped. They’ll have results of the phase 1/2 trial by July which is very close to Moderna’s timeline.Moderna’s stock has shot up like 300% meanwhile Pfizer’s didn’t even budge

Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial."&#x200B;I bought calls when this was announced a long time ago and they expired worthless. I might get back in on it tomorrow.If Donald Trump wants to turn the vaccine selection into a gameshow, MRNA will 100% make the top 3 because Trump's vaccine czar is Moncef Slaoui who was a former exec at MRNA. I feel very confident that they would make the top 2 based on this alone. Then Trump can justify rewarding contracts to both of the top 2 because they're both "wonderful", "beautiful" drugs.  Pfizer #1    MRNA #2    J&J #3
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 19:47:28'] Very nice DD.  Typically I've noticed that PFE is quite hard to trade.  It is a very undervalued stock that just doesn't want to move.  Not bad for Iron condors, but not a real money maker.  It would be nice to see PFE make some moves.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 19:55:46'] Vaccine shouldn't affect them, their market cap is so huge.I agree they know what they are doing. Whether or not to buy would be entirely on the oversold thesis, not on vaccine. Would be very hard for retail hype to move a stock of this size. Less hard on a Moderna, and easier still on a low end of small cap like INO or NVAX.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:25:06'] Lol I'm really hopeful on Pfizer.I watched them for about a month and kept up to date on their COVID vaccine dealings. Late last week I had a feeling that some news was finally coming so loaded up on OTM June calls. That was Friday at 3:55pm. Proceeded to watch them release news on the failed breast cancer trial and tank 15 minutes after market close... after hardly any movement in a month. Just bad timing lmao.Missed the better entry price but I still have faith that good news (or even a rumor) on a vaccine will pump them to near $50.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:40:48'] How do you think Fauci's recent comments will affect Pfizer's coronavirus results/stock price movement? What he said about a covid vaccine wasn't very encouraging, and I think Novavax's stock price reflected this new concern today
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:44:28'] uhm...You really think the Trump short list means anything>? Otherwise the dd is good- but I think all the vaccine makers will remain in play.We will most likley need every vaccine that can be made, the entire industry needs continued support.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 20:56:48'] I bought 5 PFE $40c 9/18 three weeks ago and they're down 40% because of that other news. I thought they were undervalued in general, and they seemed to have tremendous confidence in their vaccine candidates so I figured why not. That said they have a huge market cap and aren't going to move a huge amount no matter what (see: GILD). I also don't think vaccines will be that big of a financial gain for anyone.Holding for now, still think they will move above $40 at some point this summer.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-04 07:12:27'] No one is going to come up with a vaccine for COVID. Just forget it, its like finding a cure for the cold (essentially its the same virus family). If by some slim miracle (which is highly unlikely because its been attempted for almst 20 years), someone does, it wont be available within the next year probably two. By then COVID will have fizzled out. Short MRNA, NVAX and anyone else involved with a COVID vaccine and dont both with any of the big names. They wont be doing anything new or different than before this pandemic.Also, Phase 1 and 2 data is absolutely bullshit. Go read about what it actually means. It has nothing to do with efficacy. It just means no one died from the injection. Phase 1 is when its put in healthy people. Phase 2 is when its put into sick people. Phase 3 will take forever since you cannot actually infect healthy people to see if it worked.Positions: MRNA 45P 1/21 and 50P 07/20

POST_TEXT: b"Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.\n\n1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccinat"

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 19:36:32'] The best thing about Pfizer is they can manufacture much more efficiently and fill orders. They’re so diverse in their manufacturing line, they’ve been able to switch production to focus on vaccine as primary. Moderna can’t even fill orders promised to South Korea in July. 40M shots and they’ve only delivered 2.5M as of yesterday. How are they going to provide to any other county? But today, literally 12 hours ago, SK just ordered 30M shots from Pfizer. Pfizer’s been around for 174 years. No where to go but UP.

However, Israel Israel, Canada,Japan, are all signing deals w MRNA because Pfizer far less effective.https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-delta-biden-e9be4bb0-3d10-4f56-8054-5410be357070.htmlFurthermore, PFF has a market cap of 271.B, the 27B deal with US moved the stock ~6% higher than its previous high this year. Just because the CDC, and DC are lip-locked in a 69 with Pfizer, doesn’t mean it’s worth anything more than Joe Biden’s medicated boner.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 13:31:21'] biochem major here, -80c is the most common freezer we use. Literally almost everything we have is stored at that temp... tl;dr **Shit is unstable at higher temperatures, this isn’t weird**
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 13:34:43'] You dumb fuck OP this is how every vaccine is stored. How can I buy puts on you specifically?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 13:34:50'] Speaking from experience, many biological reagents that have proteins or are proteins are kept at -60/70C or more. They are thawed on ice, used and then refrozen. To your point though, many vaccines are stored at more "normal" temps that a common refridge can handle.It's one of the first vaccines. Tends to get better.This wouldn't affect consumers - only increases pricing. So PFE calls.Edit: -4F is -20C.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 14:22:58'] Remember folks, people like OP give you DD on stocks daily
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 13:44:47'] -94F is -70C. -80C freezers are pretty standard equipment in the biomedical field. You can expect most hospitals to have -80C freezers available to them, and if not they’re not that expensive.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 13:04:56'] I work in Pharma. I don't see this being an issue. Ultralow freezers are everywhere for long term storage. Vials that contain the drug would be tiny and thaw out extremely fast. It could probably go from frozen to room temp in 30 minutes or so, less if they pull out a daily supply for a fridge. One single ultralow could store thousands of doses, with the manufacturer having the space to store far far more. &#x200B;This could be an issue for other normal drugs, but at the speed at which they would go through all this, the 24 hour refrigeration part probably wouldn't be an issue either. Also as another user said, dry ice would work in a pinch and would also be used for shipping.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 12:54:06'] Bruh that's nothing, they will just buy more fridges from TMO.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 16:02:20'] You're actually an idiot. Vaccine products are almost always stored at -70C or lower for long periods of time. Stability at 4C up to a week and at room temp (20C) can be 3 days or less. Proteins ARE NOT stable at high temperatures. That shit starts aggregating and becomes unusable.Tldr: Pfizer's vaccine is normal to the industry and OP is a retard.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 15:16:46'] You do realize it doesn't take over 24 hours to thaw the vaccine and put it into a person? Geez someone skipped all their science classes huhLike, did you actually think someone was dumb enough to make a product that wouldn't work here on Earth? Or that, you didn't realize that if someone made something that needs to be stored at -94F, that they actually HAVE something that can store the vaccine at that temperature?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 15:31:38'] Autists on WSB proving they’re autists by assuming shit is weird in a field they have no knowledge of. Well done autists, now go make your tendies
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 16:56:57'] Everyone is calling OP a retard but they are the true retards. Yes those temperatures can be reached in biochem labs and hospitals but most MD offices and retail pharmacies (The schlumps actually administering the vaccine) have freezers that are only capable of about -10F at most. It would take millions of dollars of investing in new freezers etc, not to mention increase shipping costs, so if another company can make one that utilizes existing infrastructure, it wins EASY. A vaccine that is that unstable simply is not the solution.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 15:00:25'] If Inovio DNA vaccine works, it would be epic. That shit can be stored at room temperature

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 12:52:43'] If he was really smart, he would  have the company engineer a new virus pandemic and then have the vaccine ready earlier than everyone else, rinse and repeat for tendies.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 13:52:00'] how much stock is he awarded annually?  This may just be him diversifying. If he gets awarded millions in stock annually, it's smart to sell part of it to diversify.  probably also has to pay tax when the stock vests no? so needs to sell to pay tax.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 14:04:04'] That's gotta be wrong, 6 million is 60% of his shares? He only has 10 million in shares? The CEO of Pfizer? Either he only just joined or they're not counting unvested shares and unexercised options. This is way too low
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 14:26:49'] It's not Inspider when the news is out lol
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 14:55:24'] So much miss-information here. The sale was based on a combination of a filing window (possibly months long and out of his control) and a minimum stock price being reached. The bump on Monday hit the minimum price and it was within the window he had no hand in but was instead set by his 10b5-1 filing. &#x200B;Basically in August he banked that when the vaccine news hits in Q4 (whenever in Q4 that might be) that the price would jump and he'd make good money.

POST_TEXT: b'TLDR - PFE 35c 7/17 for the r/investing crowd and PFE 38-39c 7/17 for the true WSB autist\n\nI know many of you have a bad taste in their mouth when they hear the name Pfizer, but all of that is about to change.  You see, Pfizer will be releasing data on their coronavirus vaccine within the very near future, and as we all know, stocks with COVID treatments skyrocket on even the slightest hint of good news.  Look at GILD, MRNA and NVAX.  You might say that Pfizer is bigger than all three of them so will have less volatility and you would be correct, but GILD has a 93B market cap, so while PFE is twice as big at 187B, if inconclusive data on GILD can send it up 10% plus, think about what positive data on a coronavirus vaccine that will actually hit the public in September will do.  \n\nThe best part about this is that PFE options are pricing in extremely low volatility, so they arent even expecting much of a move which is quite surprising given how the market has reacted to coronavirus tr'

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 12:19:34'] Jesus christ you don't know anything about the SGLT2 inhibitors.Ertugliflozin DID NOT result in a statistically superior cardiovascular benefit. Guess what? All of Pfizer's competitors DO have superiority.The reason why you say "this isn't priced in" is wrong because you don't understand the data. It is priced in and the stock didn't move as the market didnt expect much from it anyway given its the fourth to market SGLT2 inhibitor.Edit: please everyone OP is a fucking retard. "[Pfizer's diabetes drug] will be an oral agent to replace existing injectable options within the class?" No, all the SGLT2 inhibitors are already oral and have been on the market for years. OP is getting confused with insulin, which the SGLT2 inhibitors aren't competing with. Please don't listen to this DD and please don't buy calls thinking every diabetic is going to be on this wonder drug. They're not. At best there is a SGLT2 class effect which ertugliflozin would benefit slightly from, but there's little reason for a doctor to prescribe it over the other class leaders such as empagliflozin.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 07:08:19'] I went in for 9/18 35c bought at 1.16 a couple days ago.  Up a tiny amount . Given the extended time frame, I think these have some potential and zero risk of theta problems before I bail out. I saw that same article about the diabetes drug and was surprised there was no reaction to it of any significance. Very tempted to double down here. If my PCG 9/18 15c ever turn profitable, I will bailout and put the money into PFE, till then, diamond hands. I need to stop playing with energy related stocks, they burn me every single time. On a related pharma note, some other WSB autist posted TRVN getting a run up leading to their big FDA review in August. In true WSB fashion, I have taken the advice of this stranger after spending 30 minutes reviewing propaganda articles and Wikipedia. Holding 9/18 2.5c since his post and up 50% right now. In hind site, I really wish I had dumped more into it. I might still. It's cheap AF and could double over night in August.

PFE, like CSCO has a huge market cap and a low share price which means it’s not going to move like your memes. To try to spell this out even more for you retards, PFE has almost 6 B shares outstanding which, in a very dumbed down explanation of this, means that in order for PFE to go up a single dollar it’s going to need to gain 6 B in market capThis is flushing money down the drain

Eli lilly has one as well - Trulicity. Both have these have shown to make you lose tons of weight and control sugar. Moreover, Ozempic has been shown to have cardiovascular benefit and like a 26% relative reduction in mortality. The only downside to the GLP-1RA class is that they are injectables, and ppl don't like injectables. Well, Ozempic is out with an oral formulation this year, so they've pretty much cornered the market with a block buster drug that comes in all forms. No other diabetes drug will be able to touch them for a while.

Look at which company got the highest amount of funding from the Fed.> Pfizer is so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production  of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these  vaccine candidates ahead of results. All the vaccine companies are doing this retard, have you not read any news at all? The Fed specifically are asking them to do this and are backing them funds for it. AZN, JNJ, MRNA. The latter two Fauci expressed doubt about and supported AZN.

The new variant IS the new vaccine. That's exactly why every government is losing it's mind. They know this. They'll be losing all their new found powers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 04:49:42'] moderna’s vaccine and booster are stronger than pfizer’s..note that vast majority of the breakthrough cases and breakthrough cases w omicron are with pfizer or something else not moderna. moderna for some reason doesnt jive well with the fda advisory board and is less willing to release data, which is why pfizer is preferred by the fda/cdc.  the data from this year and next year though will show that moderna vaccine holds up the best…long MRNA. also long PFE but mainly because they manufacture more than the vaccine but also the antiviral.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 06:47:44'] It's not a sure thing, but most successful organisms mutate to be MORE coooperative with their surrounding biosystems.  In the case of a virus, this means they tend to become LESS deadly as they mutate (albeit more contagious.)  This means, in turn, that the current hysteria about Omicron might be misguided, and indeed the very early initial data suggests that Omicron might just be following this pattern, of becoming more contagious but less deadly.  This means there is a very real possibility that Omicron might be able to evade these vaccines AND be something not particularly worrying.  So...my take in neither.  This is a good time, IMO, to sit on the sidelines and look to pick up some value plays once emotions fade.

The day-trading crowd sold off more positions than they bought in Moderna and BioNTech.\n\nIt marks a sharp change in fortunes. Both Moderna and BioNTech have amassed triple digit gains this year, a rally the nearly $280 billion-valued Pfizer missed out on with a scant 34% gain, despite being the first -- along with BioNTech -- to win authorization for a Covid shot in the U.S. The U.S. announced today that it would start offering booster shots to the already vaccinated in September.\n\nAs Pfizer rallies, BioNTech has tumbled more than 18% from a record high reached on Aug. 9, while '

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 09:26:25'] MRNA run has been impressive, PFE hasn’t come close to it. The pandemic is not done but it’s past the half way mark. Can PFE rally like MRNA? Or is the top in?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 16:59:19'] Why is it an either or? Pfizer is a great stock to buy options because the premium is cheap. Moderna premiums are absolutely crazy, so you can just buy plain old stocks and have them pop once in a while. I personally use this strategy because Moderna premiums are way too high and risky for me.

PFE is also double the market cap of MRNA and a yuge jump in stock price isn’t likely. That said if you want to play like it is there are plenty of 1-2 month out strikes that are cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 12:46:51'] Not sure if it's priced in but Pfizer also has the only drug for wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis for at least a couple years, which is a rare disease but not as rare as previously thought. Pfizer is educating cardiologists who chalk it up to congestive heart failure. So far, it's been a quiet blockbuster and expected to be a $2b/year drug very soon. Longer term, there will be other drugs but for the time being they have a corner on the market. This drug will extend life for hundreds of thousands of people.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 23:58:13'] More American children have been shot in Chicago than died of the rona this year… Pfizer is greedily chasing more government purchasing their product for even more profit….

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-07 10:45:42'] Considering that the gene therapies are now proven to \*not\* prevent infection or transmission, and that the 0-19 year old age group has a 99.9997% survival rate, it makes perfect sense that Pfizer would want to pump their product into kids. They'll probably get away with it too, so this is likely bullish news. Pfuck Pfizer though.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 16:45:54'] Using the same design can have vastly different results.  Phizer started with like 10 different mRNA vaccines and chose the one that worked.  Curevac doesn't have that kinda capital

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 20:29:21'] INO has a solid pipeline.  It has been late to the game and needs to make up ground in the covid vax game for sure. However with variants and a still truly unknown long term outlook on this disease INO fits the bill for a potential long term play for Covid, with additional products in mid / late development stageTo dismiss INO completely seems silly just as saying it hits 500 in a month is silly
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 15:42:04'] Moderna/Pfizer is the gold standard.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 02:31:20'] I see a positive future for Inovio. I'm in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 18:30:30'] I think you should get a PHD to find out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 17:51:15'] I think you  have even less of a  scientific background than I do. mRNA is a type or class of vaccine.  Each manufacturer has their own proprietary method of making the synthetic mRNA.  CureVac was trying something new -- mRNA vaccine that was able to be stored at room temperature. Clearly their method of producing the synthetic mRNA not not successful,  The failure of this one company, CureVac,which just like Inovio has never brought a medication to market,  is not a failure of the scientific principals behind Inovio's vaccine trials have not yet started with their Chinese partner Advaccine.  Whether that trial would be accepted by the FDA or the foreign equivalent agencies is not known.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 16:06:05'] I have hope in the Novavax vaccine
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 17:01:36'] Right. Dumbing it down to common man would perhaps be to explain the jargons ij simple term. Anyway it's subjective. Btw, DNA vaccines which you called garbage are already in market for veterinary vaccinations. RNA vaccine on the contrary weren't even a viable option yet. 😉
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 15:46:07'] INO-4800 and 4802 are the safest and most effective vaccine yet to be released on the world. 4802 addresses the variants as well. Too bad the crooked FDA is in Big Pharma’s pocket. It’s great the rest of the world will benefit from Inovio’s technology, really wish the US could as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 15:58:14'] You get gold medal for coming first (Pfizer), silver second ((Moderna), bronze for third (J&J). Do you know what 4th, 5th etc finishers get? Nothing. Ok, maybe you get a cap. That’s what Inovio will get for being the 6th? Vaccine. A Cap.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-10 21:02:27'] Is it though? I've been taking profits and averaging down for the past two weeks but that past two days haven't looked good at all. I honestly think it'll go back down to where it was yesterday within the first 15 minutes just because we see everyone taking profits. The stock gets just the slightest bit of momentum and then completely falls on its face like a whore and I'm afraid there might be too much faith in it. idk i really have no clue, the stock likes to do the opposite of what I think so maybe it'll go to the moon tomorrow and my final remaining call will print. Regardless, I got DAL calls too and i'm sure there will be a nice pump tomorrow. again, who tf knows

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 14:13:25'] I will post an update tonight with full interpretation of results. Short answer is that these are excellent results against two far more challenging variants than what PFE/MRNA were evaluated against. NVAX's supply deals will be locked in there will be many more deals coming now that they have Phase 3 data.To get a better idea of the efficacy, it's important to subset the data by variant:1. **95.6% efficacy against the original strain -> i.e. best result to date**2. 85.6% against UK strain3. 60% efficacy against SA strain in the non-HIV positive cohortAlso important to note that NVAX included more elderly than any of the other trials to date with 27% of the trial consisting of 65-84. For comparison, Pfizer's trial cutoff at 70.The drop-off in efficacy from UK to SA is a big deal for the rest of the world. I will explain more about this in my update.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 13:49:23'] Some key points according to [Novavax's press release](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3):* "95.6% against the original COVID-19 strain"* "85.6% against the UK variant strain"* 60% effective against the troubling new South Africa strain* "These data suggest that prior infection with COVID-19 may not completely protect against subsequent infection by the South Africa escape variant, however, vaccination with NVX-CoV2373 provided significant protection."   * So It sounds like anyone previously infected still needs to get vaccinated.If I recall correctly, Moderna's efficacy against the original strain is 94% and Pfizer's was 95%Edit:  🚀🚀🚀🚀

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 15:56:36'] Honestly, I'm sad most of WSB is too busy with GME drama to notice this. There is so much potential with $NVAX.  The market cap is tiny compared to revenue potential and other peers such as MRNA
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 13:41:05'] It's not mRNA based but it's similar to Pfizer and Moderna in that they both present the Coronavirus spike protein to generate an immune response. It appears to be less effective against the South African variant though I wonder if a larger vaccine dose would produce more antibodies. The reason Moderna's vaccines are said to protect against the SA variant is because the immune response is so vigorous, with like 20 times more antibodies than a natural Covid infection.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 13:46:15'] Sciency person here- the results on the South African variant are concerning (50% efficacy) but 90% efficacy on the same variants as moderna and Pfizer is great.  Remember we don’t know how effective moderna or Pfizer vaccine are against the new South Africa variants, only lab tests that indicate it *should* work but no clinical data and realize that moderna has said they think their vaccine will be less effective and have started developing an additional booster vaccine dose to cover for it.Now here’s the kicker and the real reason the nvax vaccine is a game changer: it doesn’t require the special -80C freezers, it can be stored and transported via regular fridges (2-8C)!  This will be the vaccine that gets out into all the retail pharmacies and clinics around the country/world. No big expensive freezers at your local CVS.

If you agreed, you would have made a lot of money and will make a lot more money going forward.Whoever gets the first approval matters a lot in this Covid-19 vaccine race and I agree that BNTX/PFE has a good technology but they will not be the first and they are more focused on oncology (cancer) and Moderna has been focused on infectious disease (virus) for years.Agree with me this time and you will make a lot of money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-13 13:41:41'] Antibody titers don't matter very much.[https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673621020468.pdf](https://www.thelancet.com/pb-assets/Lancet/pdfs/S0140673621020468.pdf)"Even if humoral immunity appears to wane, **reductions in neutralising antibody titre do not necessarily predict reductions in vaccine efficacy over time**, and reductions in vaccine efficacy against mild disease do not necessarily predict reductions in the (typically higher) efficacy against severe disease. This effect could be because **protection against severe disease is mediated not only by antibody responses, which might be relatively short lived for some vaccines, but also by memory responses and cell-mediated immunity,** which are generally longer lived."

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-14 23:33:41'] The reason is the braking systems are like 200 years old because they're not required to update to electric ones, as well as not being required to register as a hazardous load...because lobbyists and corporate greed...but they had enough money to buy back $200 billion in shares, though...
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-14 23:13:00'] >This is outrageous! How dare they hold Norfolk Southern accountable for this derailment. Everyone knows that trains just randomly derail all the time, and it's not like there's any evidence that suggests otherwise. I'm going to go short NS stock now. Thanks for giving me this information, RtardedAPE!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 11:02:18'] It’s blatantly obvious many of you posting have never worked in the railroad industry. After 15 years of track maintenance and seeing countless derailments I can guarantee the braking system had nothing to do with it.

Biden has almost no chance the insane “defund the police support” ended any chance he had along with him being a well known child molester his mind is going fast.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 00:26:38']  Another solid day for $PFE.  I bought into $PFE in Feb when the RSI went sub-terranean (RSI<30), and it has had a good run. March was a steady climb, and then a quick acceleration in April riding the upper Bollinger until about 4/21 where it overheated, peak RSI 80.  It has pulled back only slightly from that - MACD is straddling the signal and RSI at 65 - ahead of 5/06 earnings call. The company has been instrumental in addressing the global pandemic.

You cant create prolonged gains without the bio sector etf XBI doing well. The sector is 100% short right now, meaning the pigs are tanking biotech R&D and companies share prices are dwindling and they will be unable to raise the necessary funds to complete research.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 11:50:13'] TMC is trash as a stock? Definitely. If it has play potential? One of the very Breakout play before 2022. Buy low, sell high, analysts placed as oversold and a price of 8.9, with momentum and enough greediness, we might, and when I sell we, only if the Ticker gets popular, touch the 10.I bought the dip heavily, why? Dead cat bounce and the stock has yet to make the classic bounce to get closer to the IPO Open Price. Pure technical play. Might be the only non-gamble move I am performing this year, since the others I was beating in fundamentals which is not my niche. Ironnet, had the CEO General, nothing, however if touches anything under 20, yes, bounce play.I don't want to pump TMC, it's not a good stock, long term, it's a huge gamble. Short term, as I mean, before December, the Chart is screaming for a breakout and do the hiking to see if its value gets close to the IPO Price. Possible? Definitely, however I think it will be short lived, however loam around the 8-9 consolidated. A buy? Definitely. No short squeeze bs, no gamma. It's a classic good sum up of Dead Cat Bounce + First time being under IPO Price.The Recipe? Tasty. Probabilities if we are talking numbers and chart? Huge. IMO, Calls, buy, safe sell is at IPO price open. Feeling greedy, sell a bit past that. Remember, they always do ONE DCB, before falling completely dead. YOLO in Puts during the bounce. Have enough money to fucj around WSB forever and laugh when you lose 100k, but profited 300 a week ago. Bye, I am not your friend, don't follow me, but I respect a Wendys worker who is risking his salary in that fucking casino, takes huge cojones.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 12:41:13'] Took my hit on TMC and got out with only a couple hundred lost before I did some serious bag holding. Wish I would have just paid someone $20 to kick me in the balls and call it a day instead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 12:54:12'] If QS can trade at 11bn market cap on a hype that will not bring any results not before 2025/26, but TMC is trash for next 3y?! If they deliver even 25% what they are saying i.e. 33bn of resources. Then this is a big buying opportunity beyond all BS of short squeeze and float!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 18:55:10'] What’s up with all this hate on TMC? If you don’t like the stock don’t buy it… Lost money? Sell. Don’t think it will go back up?  Sell. I’m absolutely bag holding at the moment. Just curious as to why everyone has a dick in their ass for believing some bullshit about a 2.75million float? People are trying so hard to tank this thing like it fucked their moms. If you idiots did your own due diligence you would know the fucking float isn’t 2.75m. The price action alone can tell you that. Ortex has ff at about 100 million and other exchanges show a little over 19 million. I am degenerate enough to be in it but smart enough to know a dead cat bounce is likely. Some more dips maybe but definitely a bounce coming. Wtf do you guys think the institutions are going to move this to OTC like 10 days after IPO? If it does tank to that point. I will never trade again and tip my hat to these cock suckers shorting this thing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 12:50:36'] The Hood is always good
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 22:53:47'] I always wonder if people still look at the technicals and how many shares were shorted these past few days. Shorts definitely got greedy and pummeled the stock with it being oversold on float news but tbh this cheap is basically free money, especially after being at 15 the other day and dropping so bad off no news. IMO I hope bulls crush the shorts who got overly greedy, but regardless this should be over 8 bucks it’s a shame how much manipulation goes on with these stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 07:27:24'] WF is dogshit and I'm amazed its stock has performed so well or on par with its competitors year after year even in the face of fines and controversies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 08:39:07'] Wells Fargo is an organization that everyone should avoid like a plague.I wound up with a Wells Fargo serviced mortgage. Backed by Fannie Mae.When I caught my ex-wife cheating on me just prior to the pandemic, I filed for divorce. She made the most money out of us at that point for the first time in the marriage (hypergamy, yayyy), and so I ran out the numbers and determined that she was the only one of us who could actually afford to keep the property. I verified that she could take an assumption through WF.Instead of making the mortgage payment, she took her new man toy out on a multiple mortgage-payment-sized vacation, crossing multiple state lines on the onset of the pandemic. She then proceeded to seek out the mortgage forbearance on her own without my knowledge.This led to me not even finding out (divorce decree had been signed/accepted, she was the responsible party at this point) that she had done it until the property was already $7500 behind. To top this off, she bought dogs that destroyed the house. They shit on the high dollar carpet. Pissed on everything. Tried digging through the nice carpet, too.Then the spring rains hit hard (250 year storm). The sewer came out of the basement. I wound up removing all of the carpet and doing chemical spray, then getting the pathetic insurance rider utilized in order to take care of the damage without going over. Got everything repaired. Thankfully, the dogs were gone at this point after murdering one of the family cats.She ran the forbearance down to 18 months on the day. I had to go in and clean up the mess and try to get the house ready to sell again. It was ready to sell. But by this point, the equity had been eaten by her lack of payments despite her ability to pay (she had a \[or near\] six figure salary with a very, very popular pharma company at this point).I convinced her to sign the property over to me within the marriage so that I could do a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Still no divorce at this point, fun. After she had moved out, I had handed the property over to Wells Fargo's property preservation department. They changed the locks, so I didn't think I could get into the property anymore. I let it be.Only after talking to the neighbor some months later did I find out that *they* had been mowing the lawn. *They* had been having to go over to the house once or twice a day to close the front door because they botched the lock installation and it wasn't latching. They had also been trying to call Wells Fargo (number on the front door) that the door was blowing open, and then that there was water in the basement.When I called Wells Fargo, that department told me "we can't talk to you because the house is under litigation." That's fine. You're the property preservation department. I dunno. Maybe PRESERVE it. So I'm having to fight a giant to convince it to mind its own future assets.Whoever was going in, late spring found standing water in the basement. The one I had *just fixed* from the prior spring. They never turned the power on. So no sump pump running. They would not listen. I warned them that if they didn't do anything they'd be looking at tens in thousands of damage. It was still *my* property at that point, and they were destroying it while also adding more due each month to the note. To top that off, I had to drive two hours to and from the property to take a picture of the sump pump on the property to prove to them that a house right next to a flood plain *does indeed have a sump pump* because its *required by code*.Finally, after weeks of screaming, I got a hold of someone who could get a hold of someone to clarify that yes this department could talk to me, allowing me to call them and inform them that YOU FKED UP SON.Mold had climbed up 5 feet by the time they got around to getting someone into the house.They called me a couple months later to inform me that the damage had been repaired. No it hadn't. Nothing had been done except removal of the bottom 4 of drywall. In the mean time, I finally won my divorce a few months back.Wells Fargo called and said that the property was worth significantly more and asked if I wanted to put it back on the market. Why would they say this given the damage? Huh.So I drove up and took a look at the property. Wow. Slum lords would wince at the quality of work. Even with the great California/NewYork diaspora, I would be hard pressed to sell the property for that amount of money. Paint where there should not be paint. No paint where there should be paint. Drywall over where there used to be venting ducts. Horrible drywall/mudwork. Carpet badly installed. Trim the wrong size, pre-finished, not painted over, gapped badly. Doors in shoddy shape (damaged). Custom shelves destroyed. Lighting fixtures missing. They want to claim its worth 17% more now than when my ex wife and I bought it originally? The property was *gorgeous* when I bought it. Now its hideous. *I* could have done better work, and I *have* done better work, and I'm not a handyman by any stretch. They rushed it.But if it had been worth that much, the fact that their malfeasance or ineptitude or stupidity or all of the above had cost me months of potentially having it on the market to sell without having to do a deed in lieu.Wells Fargo is a shit company. They are an unethical company. They do not care about their customers. They care about the almighty dollar and sucking off their shareholders. They are a corrupt company.The fact that Wells Fargo is not allowed to grow until the fix their culture problems is not justice to me, nor is 3.7billion in fines. I was robbed of choice. I was robbed of authority on something I had was contractually but not legally responsible for. And then I was told to pound sand on multiple occasions because they couldn't read their own notes.The irony is that for the last two years, the only one in my transaction that was apparently working towards Wells Fargo's benefit? Me. At my own detriment. In retrospect, maybe I should have gone and gutted every wall. Broken every window. Its my property after all. Why not? But you see, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Because its not the right thing to do.I ask how in the world is it that the guy who had no choice in the financial disaster was the only one between me, an ex wife, and a multi-billion dollar organization that was actually trying to take care of the issue? I ask myself daily. "Why do I bother." "Why do I care." They obviously *do not*.Wells Fargo? If they could set the house on fire and still charge me a mortgage on something they burned to the ground they would. They are the worst. They are just. The fucking. Worst.On that note. If there's anyone that wants a "$400,000 property" that's a 5 bed 3 bath 3 car garage quarter acre lot with gas and electric and good internet home in the midwest, message me. If you want to buy it in cash for the value owed and skip the real estate agents I'm interested in entertaining offers before it goes to foreclosure. Maybe your standards for the basement work are lower than mine since you don't remember what it used to look like. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)Something I have found funny is that every time I have mentioned the word "lawyer" all of these organizations clam up like a prude on prom night. "Sir, you cannot make legal threats, if you are going to threaten legal action I will have to hang up right now."  Holy shit, you bitch. I literally said "there's no way I can fight Wells Fargo legally." Hell, when the house initially went to the foreclosure firm, I called them up. *THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON.* I wound up reporting to the law firm that would be foreclosing **on me** what was going on and giving them ten times the information that Wells Fargo was giving them. *I was helping them sue me and they still* ***fucked it up.*** Honestly, if I had money? One I wouldn't be in this situation. But two, I would fight them in court over a dollar on this one. I think my case is precisely what their whole "you are not allowed to grow as a bank until you fix your culture" problem is about. They haven't fixed anything. I've done nothing but suffer at their hands, and I know that there's multiple executives who have me on the email chains tied to the property, per someone at their director level.Also, if anyone is a lawyer/law firm willing to beat Wells Fargo up in court for free on my behalf to make them feel the pain they've dished out on me for the last 2+ years, get a hold of me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271). I'd at least like to be paid for the hundreds of hours I've spent being a better employee to them than their execs.

I believe that the Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) partnership has the clear advantage and will likely be able to show efficacy and obtain FDA approval first among its rivals.\n\n\n--\n\n**Rationale**\nIn order to show efficacy, the standard is that at least 30,000 individuals must be enrolled in a phase 3 trial of a vaccine candidate. This already presents a barrier to smaller companies that cannot muster the logistics to organise and carry out such a study. It improves the advantage of larger companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Although Moderna captured early hype and headlines in the USA for promising early stage results, it will likely lag behind larger companies in crossing the finish line for Phase 3 (see google trends graphic linked below).  Pfizer has recently increased its total study to include 44,000 people, making it one of the largest phase 3 studies in the world and increasing the d'

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 03:19:20'] I’ve got PFE calls a while ago, technicals look good as well. If we’re all retarded enough for weird earnings plays, we shouldn’t have trouble playing this one.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 03:01:46'] Hmmmm
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 04:21:36'] Great, now...Can you explain this with politically incorrect memes?I’ve read these companies wont fundamentally make profit on the actual vaccine because ethical taboos. So is it possible this is useful enough improving the name brand and building out infrastructure and knowledge or whatever? Or Is this a potential greater fool’s strategy of just buying before headlines hype?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 03:31:16'] Buy BioNTech now while you can. This is where the biggest gains will be seen. Pfizer stock acts like more of a bond.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 06:48:34'] The problem is that Pfizer, Moderna etc are all mRNA vaccines with a single epitope, unlike traditional live/dead vaccines. Genetic variation in COVID could make the mRNA vaccine useless
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 13:49:26'] The last pfizer pop was over in an hour it felt like. I was all in, yolo'd every last penny in my robinhood account. It went on a rocket launch that morning and my account balance doubled in what seemed like minutes. I got greedy and said, just 5 more minutes and I'll cross over the next thousand dollar mark and I'll sell. Thats when the sideways movement started and the slow descent over the next couple days.... slowly eating away at my tendies...I'm salty on pfizer. Be careful boys. I'm gonna play again this time around but I'm out when the money doubles this time.

This global race to cross the finish line will be seen as a mini Manhattan project and people will be making documentaries about this years from now.

POST_TEXT: b'With a forecast 2021 PE of roughly 11, great pharma assets & pipeline, and the continued need for Covid vaccines/boosters, I view Pfizer ($PFE) as undervalued just on current fundamentals. Not to mention theres been a lot of deferred health care by people quarantining at home, so its reasonable for sales to pick up this year. \n\nAnd lets not forget that you get paid a 4% dividend to wait for capital appreciation. PFE maintains that the dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris, Inc., which was spun out of Pfizer last year. \n\nOverall, PFE is in an industry that hasnt experienced super high valuations lately. And the fundamentals, growth potential, and  dividend all help to provide a reasonable margin of safety. \n\nNOTE: This is not investment advice. Please do your own due diligence. As of the writing of this post, I hold a long position in Pfizer shares.\n\nEDIT: Annual Covid booster shots could be a boon to Pfizer. Plus this new tech'

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-27 16:27:39'] Why? Pfizer stock historically has very slow gains and not volitile enough for options.  They arent even much of a research company as they just aquire everyone else who does it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-27 14:10:14'] Pfizer has a shit ton of intangible assets on their books and an earnings miss may accelerate a downward slide due to lack of hedge viability on those assets. Business risk equates to volatility on assets values and business risk for them is only just beginning. There is no covid cure currently and an actual vaccine or cure won’t be realized I’d say for 6 months minimum. Interesting calls nonetheless.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 16:26:10'] Medical background here, you need more relevant sources and I don’t think you understand what you are talking about.Pifzer did in fact test. Do you think a company that big and prestigious wouldn’t? They are in competition with Modera, and third country’s front line workers have started getting the Pfizer vaccine. They wouldn’t just let a classification X research chemical out into the consumer market. They got FDA approval to sell to consumers, considering how strict the FDA really is on the medical market. Yes it did get fast tracked by the FDA due to it being a international emergency with a lot of people dying.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 17:40:37'] I mean,,how many folks will actually get vaccination when simply wearing a mask is highly controversial (only in the USA) and political? In order to establish herd immunity, minimum requirement is 60%ish population will have immune system response (whether through vaccines or natural expose to COVID19), but do we think there will be 60% of Americans taking this shot that's authorized as emergency? Vaccines will definitely help to fight COVID19, but will not bring to the end of the pandemic until effective treatment will be available. This probably means to start to take a look at $REGN or $LLY.

They basically just forced the entire working population of the country to take 2 - 4 doses by going "lol HIPAA doesn't exist" and pretty much every institution went along with it. I would not be shocked at all if in the next 6 months another push along those lines was done especially while Democrats control every chamber of Washington. Yes yes I know this is reddit and only the RNC is corrupt but healthcare / Pharma is to Democrats what big oil is to Republicans so giving their biggest donor outside of tech one last "thanks for always being there for me" before they lose in November, or as a thank you for funding us if they win in November, wouldn't be out of the question. TLDR: Nah they'll just force everyone to take more again before they start losing too much money. Wall Street is your doctor now.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 10:46:05'] FDA advisors are saying the vaccine could be available on Friday if approved on Thursday. There was about a 5% pop when the UK approved the vaccine. The US is a much bigger market, so approval should drive up the stock price nicely i would think.  [https://www.businessinsider.com/when-get-covid-vaccine-us-fda-pfizer-approval-james-hildreth-2020-12](https://www.businessinsider.com/when-get-covid-vaccine-us-fda-pfizer-approval-james-hildreth-2020-12)
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 09:38:56'] Anyone here got info on the allegations that the vaccine shows tendencies to cause infertility? I know fact-checkers “debunked” it, but they actually only said that the statement “lead vaccine professor said that the vaccine will cause infertility in women” is false, because he wasn’t the lead vaccine professor and just a professor. From what I have learned the vaccine causes the body to reject a certain protein which the virus shares certain properties with. This protein however is essential in producing the placenta in the womb. I have not seen anyone explaining why this is false, perhaps someone here could shine some light?

(Myovant Sciences)Fresh off the back of Myovant Sciences’ first FDA win for relugolix in prostate cancer late last year, the Swiss pharma can now add a second indication to its flagship drug's resume.The U.S. FDA on Wednesday approved Myovant’s relugolix in combination with two hormone drugs as the first once-daily treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration for up to two years. The drug will be marketed as Myfembree.Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in the uterus. They're among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women, Myovant says, and can cause serious symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, abdominal bloating and, in some cases, infertility.They can be treated with birth control to address bleeding and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which can shrink fibroids. Patients with more severe symptoms may need surgery.Millions of women in the U.S. are affected by uterine fibroids, which account for over 250,000 hysterectomies each year, Myovant CEO Dave Marek said.Myovant predicts roughly 19 million women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids, although only a quarter of those women, or about 5 million, will experience symptoms and seek care from a physician, Marek said. About 3 million will fail on first-line treatments, he added. The company's immediate goal will be to target those patients."We are going to need to do education to get (women) to know that there are options for them and that what they're having is not normal, and that there's something to do about it," Myovant Chief Medical Officer Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira said in an interview.RELATED: Myovant leans on new partner Pfizer as it dives into first launch for cancer drug OrgovyxWednesday's approval marks the second FDA nod for Myovant in less than a year after relugolix scored a go-ahead in prostate cancer in December, sold as Orgovyx. The company is also testing its flagship drug in women with endometriosis, another painful disorder involving the uterus’s tissue, and as a pregnancy prevention medication.Pfizer will help Myovant sell Myfembree for uterine fibroid patients in the U.S. as early as June. The pharma giant doled out $650 million upfront plus sweeteners last year to get a piece of the drug, which launched in prostate cancer patients in early 2021."We are shifting from a development stage company to a commercial stage company," Marek told Fierce Pharma. "A key part of that was finding a partner in Pfizer that has tremendous strength, not only in prostate cancer but also in women's health."But Myfembree will have to battle against AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences’ already standing Oriahnn (elagolix) for a slice of the uterine fibroid market.After receiving the FDA’s clearance to help treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids nearly a year ago, AbbVie's med has a sizable head start. Oriahnn, which is approved for both uterine fibroids and endometriosis, raked in $121 million in U.S. sales for the Illinois pharma in 2020.For Myovant's part, it has not provided any forecasts into potential revenues, Marek said. However, Myovant believes physicians will favor the convenience of its once-daily pill versus the twice-daily pill from AbbVie.A bottle of 28 Myfembree tablets will cost about $975 before rebates, according to an SEC filing.RELATED: Myovant's uterine fibroid med hits the mark in 2nd phase 3 trialThe FDA based its Myfembree approval on two replicate phase 3 trials—dubbed LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2—that showed the med significantly beat placebo in preventing blood loss among women with uterine fibroids. Specifically, 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the relugolix arm responded to the treatment compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups after 24 weeks, respectively.In its approval, the FDA warned the drug shouldn’t be used for longer than 24 months due to risk of continued bone loss that may not be reversible.Editor's note: This story has been updated with comments from Myovant CEO Dave Marek and CMO Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 09:05:42'] Regarding the vaccine plays, you either buy all the vaccine companies and hope one of them hits it big or you know someone there personally who will call you when there’s a breakthrough and a media outlet coming to do a report, they’re always announced overnight, vaccine news has become a business in itself. It’s all idiotic anyways, vaccines take years to devise, years of clinical research for adverse side effects to come out, efficacy, etc etc.. immunology is not a light subject, they strait up told us in school this shit is super confusing and they still don’t understand a lot
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 09:02:29'] Vaccine news —> massive stock jump cuz people think this means COVID is over —> investors realize there are a million regulatory and logistical hurdles to distribution (e.g. vaccine has to be stored at -97 degrees Fahrenheit) —> Moderna releases better results on a vaccine that’s much cheaper to store —> stock price pulls back to more realistic levels
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 09:15:31'] Moderna announced vaccine without logistical heckle which Pfizer’s vaccine allegedly has. However, I do think this sell off is over-reaction. First, RNA Vaccines are prone to degradation so safest way to transport vaccine is to transport them in extreme low temperature. Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccine uses same mRNA technology. Pfizer indicated it’s still testing what is the OK temperature they can transport without degrading the vaccine. Second, Pfizer will not be able to produce enough vaccine to meet the demand anyway, same with Moderna. Moderna having “better” vaccine will not affect Pfizer’s vaccine demand. Pfizer and Moderna both will make money out of this.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 08:50:15'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 08:59:53'] their vaccine requires -80°C (-112°F) storage and transport, which is entirely impractical.  meanwhile, other vaccines without that problem are also close to approval.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 09:18:46'] Much of the profit is unrealized with countries like the US dumping 2bn into them. When that balance sheet shores up and fda emergency authorization it’ll moon. Projections for 14bn in revenue with strong margins. Costs 15 to make, 40 for a two dose treatment. Marketing + admin costs would probably be 10-18%. 50% margin on 14bn ain’t bad.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 13:22:19'] Great DD, just wanted to add a couple things:1. The shorts are sitting on a powder keg if the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is granted. Ortex has the current short interest at close to 50% of the free float. Good luck trying to cover that in the event an EUA is granted and the stock goes up over 100%.2. Even if you take the most pointed criticism from the Culper short report as true, that 7 of patients in the placebo group had very low O2 and were going to die (Culper itself admits this is conjecture assuming a normal distribution), you can remove those 7 patients from the pool and sabizabulin would have still resulted in a 29% relative reduction in mortality rate. EUAs have been granted to COVID drugs for far less than that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 11:44:46'] So everyone knows.  The reason approval is a slam dunk is in April it’s phase 3 was stopped early for overwhelming efficacy.  In may VERU had an emergency meeting with the FDA where they were told they could submit with no further trials.  In filings the FDA has approved of the drugs safety profile.  And just last week the New England journal of medicine released their peer review of the phase 3 study in which the drug cut the death rate in half!  This is huge!  Hundreds of lives per day will be saved if not more.

People have been getting burned buying weeklies. The average EUA is about 5 to 6 weeks but there are cases that EUA takes longer and even one company that it went past the 60 day mark.  The short % is past 40% as of late last week. This has a chance to be a multi bagger if EUA happens during the trading day. It will get halted and then the rocket ship begins.

I am pretty sure we have the shorts(report writers) to thank for the extra inspections.As for the FDA's current site inspection backlog look at their 'Resiliency Roadmap forFDA Inspectional Oversight' and updates for what is happening there.  This is why entities with heavy short positions release these "reports" that are full of drivel.  They are doing everything they can to delay or manipulate the approval process,  They are in effect delayig several life saving drugs(Not just VERU) by making the FDA go back and match the submitted data with what is saved on site in person.  It says out of about 13,500 applications only about 600 have needed inspections.  In the end I hope those shorts get caught with their pants down and squeeze hard.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 17:21:15'] I looked a bit on Twitter and you can find some negative commentary on the study VERU is basing its results along.  I'm definitely not knowledgeable to parse this out, but thought I'd raise for discussion (caveat that its written by someone with a short position).&#x200B;How different are these two groups? In $VERU's treatment group, approximately 17% of patients have an oxygen saturation of 89.4% or below at baseline.  In the placebo group, about 37% (!!!) of patients have an oxygen saturation  below 89.4% at baseline. Many of them hugely below.&#x200B;[https://twitter.com/MidwestHedgie/status/1545045917350256646](https://twitter.com/MidwestHedgie/status/1545045917350256646)
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 17:32:36'] Definitely seems interesting. But I've seen more than enough pump and dumps on similar companies that look just as good.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 17:42:02'] The Culper report is interesting, they basically admit they are just guessing that the placebo group had lower baseline oxygen levels based on the standard deviation.  But given the relatively small sample size I wonder why VERU wouldn't just provide the full data set on each patient.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 06:59:22'] Consider me skeptical. First I don’t think FDA will move that quickly. Secondly I highly doubt that the trial was sufficient in size (I know they stated  that the FDA doesn’t need more data), but 150 participants, not so sure. Third oxygen saturation in the placebo group vs treatment group (someone posted the Twitter thread on here already). Good luck to the longs, I hold no position but the company and trial is not convincing me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 11:27:01'] This is where todays movement comes from.    https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2022-N-2107-0001/comment  They are saying that they would like a large scale trial.  This will come down to the committee recommendation I think.  The comments so far(only 7 at moment) are generally in support of minimum conditional approval with reassessment due to the fact that this is a last chance before death option.  They say, correctly in my opinion, that with the safety record through all of the studies in higher doses that it wrong to deny people on the verge of death something that could save their lives.  And if the real world data does not support the conclusions in the study than withdraw the approval.      The price will more likely than not drop down to around $8 I think,  which I will more than likely buy more shares at.  If the public comments are overwhelmingly in support from reputable high profile medical professionals that could change but it will be a dog fight until and during the meeting with it being the same 50/50 chance of approval as before until the recommendation is given.

So the big question is what does the FDA have against sabi and Veru? It may be the. Biden Adam that is influencing the FDA to ignore this miracle drug because at this time they don't want to channel money their way. I say that because Biden screws almost everything up and we all know that except the dems

The issue there is that a spike in deaths will lose them money on services while urn/casket sales go up. They are unintentionally hedged against a pandemic spike in deaths that limits funeral activities.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi all\n\nI would like to share the knowledge and experience I have gained by reporting on analysis of the stocks I pick as long-term buys. These shares are **value oriented which means that the price of the share is lower that what the company could be at based on the finances of the company**. I use free cash flow metric since having profitable steady cash flow is paramount to continued growth of the company.  These valuations are calculated using the **conservative assumptions** leaning towards a grimmer outlook than what may be to hedge against the worst-case scenario. For example, in current calculations for the CPAM (capital asset pricing modeling) I am using a 9% return of the S&P500 benchmark (as opposed to 10% overall or 24% for 2019), and for a return available on a risk-free investment is using a 10-year CD fixed rate of 2.5%).

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 09:52:25'] In my view $35.5-$36 is a good entry point and there is an upside potential as long as they don't do something terrible. The issue with the upside is that in their business it's hard to stumble on a major rally. They would need a new drug with a huge distribution potential in order to have a serious run. In absence of that it's going to be a slow climb.  There is also a good chance of being stuck with a stock that has rather minor fluctuations for a while .  I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are better opportunities.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 11:39:44'] So you have two scenarios - no growth and growth. Your no growth is the worst case scenario. What about the scenario where sales decline? I would consider this the worst case.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 12:11:51'] 9% return for CPAM doesn't seem that conservative to me. We've been in a record bull market for a while now, and to assume 9% going forward is a bit unrealistic.

Buy puts it’s gonna tank with higher premiums, more cars on road, more accidents, higher repair fees and less marketing spend all leads to a shit earnings and shit guidance going into Q2. Also as a performance marketing publisher I know they just shut off most of lead buying due to profitability issues

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 07:02:58'] I’m long in AMD and SBUX. I’m sure AMD will have good er and probably good guidance. But I can see it popping and fading like MSFT and such from previous week. Just not enough love for tech right now. SBUX, I’m not expecting anything good - just hoping it’s not a complete shit show. So many headwinds for SBUX. It’s below where I bought it in summer 2020. 😢

Fortunately, thanks to talking incredibly dumb shit about solid state batteries two years ago, their slightly OTM calls are pennies. Even if they're still retarded, I lose fuck-all 🤷Alternatively, next week is GlobalFoundries, and they indisputably do not suck

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-03 14:17:28'] Looking like my SBUX calls are gonna print big. Almost everyone on WSB was saying to buy puts.SBUX was at a 2 year low, and once China ends their dumb zero covid policy soon the stock will moon more. It made no sense to short this stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 12:53:50'] My moves this week. Calls on Murphy Oil, Estee Lauder, and Goodyear Tires this week. Puts on AirBNB, DoorDash, and Mercado Libre. Sell Murphy Oil and Goodyear Tire calls before the closing bell though if you’re in the green. Sell AirBNB and Mercado Libre Puts if you’re in the green before the closing bell. Mercado Libre burned a lot of bears last time, and I would think people would go into the trade feeling bearish considering what happened to AMZN. AirBNB has a chance to resurge provided people are traveling after being cooped up for 2 years. This stock is still overvalued at 90+ billion though, especially in this uncertain fiscal climate.Murphy Oil is a no brainer; natural resource stocks still have room to run I feel, but you could lose in the short term price action if earnings don’t match up with the upcoming demand we’ll probably have for crude. I’ll buy shares if earnings results into a bloodbath. Goodyear is the biggest gamble I feel, out of the 6 I mentioned. Still, I don’t believe it’s overvalued in the slightest to warrant a huge sell off. I was very surprised it’s only valued at just below 4 billion. Last year they made more than 10 billion on revenue, and with everyone starting to get back on the road en masse, I think we’ll see things improve due to higher demand.Remember this is only the moves of a degenerate retard, so you can probably make BIG cash inversing me. Happy trading y’all!

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:48:50'] Because of the acquisition rumor and the CEO resignation, people are swarming into PTON with high hopes and shit. It’s the same people that jack off to the 🚀 emoji
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:17:37'] There's a rumor that Peloton might get bought out by a larger corporation."Buy the rumor, sell the news"Whether an overhaul merger buyout or bankruptcy hits the news. That's when I predict selling will happen and the price will fall.Pfizer is a fact of life that isn't going anywhere, it's not dramatic or sexy so price movement and volatility is not likely and people expect that.People wanna make money, they wanna gamble.That mindset follows the risk. Pfizer is not risky, Peloton is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:34:15'] PTON is being straight up manipulated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 10:16:27'] A pandemic is, by definition, global.Stay in school kids.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:51:06'] There's a feeling that pandemic is over. I had omicron. My mom had it, my 86 year old grandfather had it. All vaxxed. Common conclusion: Well it was just some light fever and coughing for 3 days. Some think that Pfizer peaked like they won't be able to sell more than they are selling right now. Back to selling dick pills. And it's not like Pfizer is the only company. Like soon there'll be around 15 or more companies making covid vaccines. It's not like Pfizer has monopoly.  And Peloton - pump, dump. Somebody needed to get out would be my guess.ER season - I'm not touching anything, that's lurking season for me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 10:34:10'] Pfizer has been priced in for ages bud.  I made 30-40% on that trade.  Market is about taking money from the impatient to the patient.  Aka all you buffoons. Xoxo
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 13:49:11'] Explanation: the price of Pfizer already factored in all those things. People expect record revenue and profit so the stock was priced based on that. Any negative news, like revenue missing expectations, hurts the stock price. Peloton, on the other hand, was hammered because of a tv show. The financials of the company didn’t change. Once that realization hit the savvy investors flooded back in. Stock price has little to do with the current state of a company. It changes when expectations change.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 13:17:13'] Its not insanity - you just don't know how stocks work    PFE is a MATRUE company, they have market cap of $300B and IPOd in 1940. PTON has a market cap of $12B and IPOd less than 3 years ago. PFE also offers a divdened.      You are comparing a boomer, safe, hands-off, 401-k, pass on to my grandchildren stock to a growth stock.    In general, avoid trading dividend stocks, and mega caps. They just aren't going to move.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:51:32'] Because everything you say is already in the price. Pfizer was high because it has the only drug in pandemic. If if wouldn't, it would be even lower. Peleton is low because it's a crappy business model, if it was a better business, it would be even higher. The price is a perfect reflection of everyone 's average opinion with all the information publicly available already incorporated in all those opinions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:47:06'] Pfizer is down because covid vaccinations in 1st world countries have peaked.  Additional boosters not recommended,  so people took profits.  Peloton is facing lawsuits and government investigations.  When shit like that happens,  companies try to get good publicity.  Probably buying their own shares and expensing it under advertising. It will eventually end up on the balance sheet as "goodwill".  Basically, they want retail investors to think it's a good investment in a sketchy market. Then management dumps their shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 09:52:35'] Because the company gives a guidance on how much they're gonna make in profit next quarter. Then the analysts are like "no, no, wait, it's gonna be much more".

Single-day or short-term moves *are,* however, heavily influenced by emerging events - in this case it's that Peleton is seeking a buyout, and in general companies pay a hefty premium to stock price when they make an acquisition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 13:32:41'] u need to take an basic accounting course first it seems like you are totally clueless about the basics of enterprise shares.  stock price is nothing but a number at which the market values one share of a company. A share is a part of a company. It represents a part of the capital of the company.  How big this part per share is differs from company to company.  This capital that is represented by the share is working at the enterprise, and it is (hopefully) earning money now or at some point in the future.  How much money it earns (in terms of future profits)  , and how much money it represents (in terms of real estate, machines, stock, cash , well educated employees) play into the markets evaluation of the price of  a share. A company that has 3 billion shares  and sits on real estate that is worth 3 billion and no debt and doesnt do anything, will trade it 1 Dollar per share. Now this company rents out the real estate and makes money from it, 300 million per year profit after taxes. (ca 10 % profit)&#x200B;Now  this company has its value of 1 dollar per share in holdings, and it makes 10 cent profit per year. so how much is the value of the share now? some say 1.1 Dollar, because perhaps they wont get their rent after next year. others say 1.5 dollar, because its stable income over more than the next year.  Others say 3 dollar, because it will have renters in the next 10 years and the real estate value will increase by 50 %. and so on. &#x200B; That is the market, and after all different opinions come together and bargain, the market price for the share will be set, by buyers and sellers of shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:20:44'] All pandemics are global by definition. Saying it’s a global pandemic is redundant. An epidemic is isolated within certain geographical areas.

Btw, Pfizer is humongous firm and how its shares are distributed is not clearly known. It is also possible that the company’s revenue does not rely on stock performance.

Great time to short it if you can time it right.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 13:30:14'] Aside from everything else everyone’s saying Pfizer also just abandoned development of the intravenous version of paxlovid and had apparently underwhelming trial data on its efficacy in the treatment of severe covid. That along with uncertain projections on the long term course of the pandemic and other market forces can easily create some short term fud. This will likely only affect them short term and their long term projections are good. From a pandemic standpoint paxlovid’s data for efficacy when administered early in disease onset is great and will likely change the landscape of the pandemic quite drastically once they’re able to get an ample supply of it on the market. And I think reasonably covids here forever so paxlovid would be handy. That said there’s more that goes into whether a drug is profitable than just whether or not it’s useful. Biotech, medical science, and pharmaceuticals are extremely complex and you shouldn’t invest in those companies for short term gains unless you really understand the industry on both a scientific, regulatory, and economic level. It’s way more complex then “derp people get sick stonk go up”

Group revenues, Pfizer said, fell 11% to $11.8 billion but again beat analyst\'s estimates of a n $11.55 billion tally.\n\nLooking into the final half of the year, Pfizer said it sees revenues of $48.6 billion to $50.6 billion, a $100 million increase from its prior forecast,  and adjusted earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, a 3 cents per share improvement.\n\n"We remain fully committed to confronting the public health challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic by collaborating with industry partners and academic institutions to develop potential approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19," said CEO '

POST_TEXT: b"You know, for the past few months, all we've been talking about is Tesla hitting 2k and whatnot. I noticed that you guys aren't really talking about the matter at hand in the world today: Corona. All this time I've spent in this subreddit I thought that I missed out on hitting big, but now that I've learned to take advantage at the matter at hand, I feel like I've finally found something useful to be here for. When the COVID vaccine comes out, It's going to be a HUGE deal, and I was thinking that maybe we should take a look at Pfizer (PFE), Biontech (BNTX), Moderna (MRNA), and/or AstraZeneca (AZN), the leaders in the race for the vaccine, so we can see them as an opportunity for this subreddit and its future. They have done the most testing for the vaccine and there is a possibility that one of them may release it first, and when that happens, millions of people will go get vaccinated around the world.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-10 08:48:37'] Not a huge fan of the vaccine play to be honest. I hate the hype behind all of those companies. Pfizer is the most boring stock of all time. Covid is too unpredictable and even if they make a vaccine it may not even be effective. People may not want to, or refuse to take it. The election result will cause polarizing outcomes given how opposite each party feels about the pandemic and how to handle it, which brings even more volatility in predicting this stock play. No thanks!

POST_TEXT: b'So I missed out on calls for Pfizer and Moderna. Looking for some green with the remaining vaccine opportunities. I am thinking Astrazenca (AZN)/Oxford and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are good contenders. What do you guys think?\n\n[Vaccine breakthrough puts Covid protection within reach](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-coronavirus-drug-vaccine-status/)'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 12:22:37'] Yeah don't buy pharmaceuticals lmao. Stick with EV if you wanna gamble.PLTR if you wanna double your money in a year
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 14:08:04'] Moderna and pfe is lower than it was before the covid pump. Ev pump is the way.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 12:48:20'] I got jan 80c on AZN, waiting for the pop
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 14:04:54'] AstraZeneca are unlikely to profit, they are selling their vaccine at cost in Europe and developing countries which will be their main markets.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 12:22:13'] Out of curiosity anyone betting on BDX?  I know this is a BEAR stock but it’s dropping like crazy and I know for a fact that all those vaccines need to be injected into us.  That means it needs to go into syringes and needles need to go into us.  And BDX OWNS THIS SPACE.  Governments are contracting with them directly just for these products because these have all passed FDA and HC.  This division is a huge part of BDX.  I know shit, and this is my first crack at DD btw but I do work in this segment.  But I am a total autist and am deep into PLTR and NIO so wtf do I know.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 17:04:02'] Johnson and Johnson are almost done with their full release of an Ebola Vaccine. Theyve been working on it for several years. My dad is the pediatric specialist for the company that determines whether a drug is safe or unsafe for children. Dont know what itll mean for their stock but thats definitely promising news.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 09:29:45'] This. Also, if you're buying during a peak out of FOMO and "never selling," then you will be a bag holder. Gravel on the path to other people's gain porn. You see those red ski slopes that follow the green climbs? That's people here selling at the peak to make short term profits. If you are a small investor playing with funds that aren't play money to you, buy at the bottom of that red slope and sell near the top of the green hills, apes. Take a moderate profit, grow the funds in your trading account in small increments, then maybe take a bigger risk when you've actually made a little cash from your trades. Or cash out your profits and get a month ahead on your mortgage or rent, buy a new king size bed, put it in savings for an emergency. There's no shame in that. Ignore the shit posters here.The key to gambling, and this most certainly is gambling, is knowing when to walk away. Group think and hope isn't going to lead to winnah winnah chicken dinnah. Be smart, take the small to moderate gains when you can, live to trade another day. Nothing is going to go to $420,069. Don't ride that train, it's actually a short bus.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm hungry and these crayons are getting cold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 06:41:48'] I'm a noob in every sense of the word.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 09:24:32'] THIS. Only spend what you can afford to lose, don't buy into fomo when it's green, wait till it's red again and then wait for the next frenzy. If it falls, don't panic sell. continue to put in what you can, lowering your average share cost and weather the storm. I've always been to impatient, thought I learned my lesson but then I sold my AMC a few weeks before it took off after playing it for months. Yes I was in the green, but I would've been in the green about 7x more. I bought a bunch of marimed stock expecting to make a quick couple of bucks to dump back into AMC. I did and still am gaining from that call, but once again, I would've made A LOT more if I'd patiently hodled. Moral of the story.. Some boomer once said stock market is means of transferring banana from impatient monke to patient monke or something like that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 13:29:41'] I was staring down the path of 4 years of working 3 jobs to pay off debt associated with a divorce.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 07:44:21'] A friend of mine, even though I begged him not to, sank all of his money (meaning everything in his bank accounts, and pawning his (deceased) father's watch) into GME the morning of January 29th. I told him to wait for a dip after all the nonsense from Robinhood, but he genuinely believed it was going to hit $10k the following week. He'd started moving money into RH earlier that week, and it took him a while to get everything tidy before he was ready to buy. At least I convinced him to hold for as long as he can, but he's down around 30% still. Sad part is he's not exactly wealthy, and he's had to stretch (and borrow a bit from me, which of course I don't mind doing) to make it work. Buyer beware. These memestocks are volatile, and you can't predict hype prices with 100% accuracy. Look at AMC this morning. I think it'll recover, but who knows? If you bought at $65 yesterday, you're probably not having a good morning. Just... realize that it's a gamble. I think some of them are **good** gambles, but I would never, ever, ever, **ever** recommend spending money you need for **food and f\*&\^ing shelter** on *any* investment. These are longer plays than you might think. Also, a lot of these new investors seem to think they just hit "sell" and money magically appears. Someone has to buy it. Just because the price is at $10k doesn't mean you can sell it for $10k. It could be less. Significantly less. It's more than just timing the top, it's timing the top and being able to sell what you want to at that price.I want everyone to make money, and hope you all do. Just don't bet the damn farm on a meme.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 06:22:21'] Yeah I have not had an income in 4 months because of long covid, sitting in the bleachers sucks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 08:18:18'] Investing rules for most people need to be essentially the same as gambling, because at worst it's that not much different; only bet what you can afford to lose. That doesn't include your rent, food, loan payments, etc.Meme stocks can certainly help if you get in at the right time, but people that don't already have lots of $$ to invest at once in one thing generally aren't going to be overnight millionaires.  If you bought into AMC/GME back in 2020 with change fished out of the couch, you made out, probably paid off some debt and good for you; but most of those folks didn't know what was going to happen later on in 2021.Making smart, long-term choices based on sensible growth is what gets you long-lasting gains.  If you have some play $$, sure, shoot the works or get in on penny stocks or an AMC if you get some info. But few 'putting your entire weekly paycheck into meme stonk' situations are going to pay off before you need that $$, if you're paycheck-to-paycheck or close to it.

Some people do get lucky and grab a 300% increase on their rent money. But even so they'll probably lose it in a few months on another gamble. I'd venture to say maybe 5% of the people here have actually built wealth starting from a small amount invested 1-5k. These folks probably don't say much and are actually thoughtful and disciplined investors.  Most folks are either rich already and posting hilarious gains/losses, or you're just fucking around with your rent money and losing more often than not. But hey it's all fun if you can afford it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 05:54:52'] Edit: GET OUT NOW. AMC’s own words from the new prospectus: “Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.” Does that sound good to you? Ever heard a company tell you not to buy their own shares because you’ll lose all of it? I hate to say this, but some of you guys need to hop the hell out of AMC at market open. They are issuing 11,000,000 new shares, diluting existing stock, and I guarantee you that you are going to start seeing AMC insiders cashing out since AMC management holds a little over 7% of total stock. This is no GME where there was at least some substantial institutional shareholders like BlackRock. This thing has the potential to crash so hard and fast that you won’t have a chance to take profits. I’m proud of you guys and I hope new millionaires were made on here, but I’m warning you of what is possible.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 07:36:55'] I really want to double down this sentiment. I FOMO’d into GME at $150 in January and over 2 days watched it jump $100 in 15 seconds and also plummet $200 in 5 minutes. What did I learn? Patience. Over the next few months when I had an extra $1-200 and nothing specific to buy i’d toss it into some more GME or AMC and just got my average down. I’ve currently invested $1400 and my portfolio is sitting around +100% today. I’m 26 and I’ve been poor my entire life. This small lil bag i’ve been building is more than enough for me. My next plan? Learning and deciding on my exit strategy cause it’s currently nonexistent.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 08:10:44'] Totally agree.  Even if you buy into some underperforming companies that are looking like they have deals being inked and new product/tech agreements about to pay out. Some/many of those gains won't be 600%, they might be 5%, 20% or possibly more, but there's not a GREAT way of telling where they will fall. Even the analysts make mistakes.  BUT... those same companies could shit the bed and leave you with losses.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 08:16:17'] Yep, this gets so overlooked. The people making 200k have to get it from somewhere and I hate to say it, it isn't all hedgefunds that money comes from. If you wouldn't take it to a casino knowing damn well you are most likely going to lose it, don't take it to the stock market either. It's literally the largest online casino ever.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 09:19:08'] Hopefully everyone understands to never risk more than you can afford to lose. And buying shares of stock is always safer than options. It's easy to lose 100% of your options but you almost never lose 100% of your stock.

Waaaaah. The market is kind of weird now. Like it always has fucking been. You think we live in some special point in history? Issac Newton, who invented calculus and formulated the original relativity before Einstein literally was a retard who lost all of his money on worthless flowers because he thought he was rain main with markets. Every post talking about Illuminati's and all that other shit just goes further and further to prove people literally cannot accept, or fathom, people aren't smart enough to be able to understand and control markets. Markets are insanely complex. There are far too many input variables. Those huge hedge funds everyone talks about and how they speak about them completely controlling everything or whatever is ridiculous. Have you ever ACTUALLY looked at their returns? Not some off hand bullshit. Go look at fund managers returns. They are almost, and I do truly mean almost as retarded as us here. The only difference is theoretically, sometimes, they have a retard line that exist that quite literally does the opposite of whatever dumb shit they are about to do so they don't lose money. That's right. That stupid joke everyone makes here about inverting our ideas is literally how huge funds operate. They have extremely complicated and sophisticated mathematical models that all amount to them just trying not to blow up while making bad decisions. The market is just as dumb as it's always been. There are random speculative assets, and said assets are getting fucked right now. All those "great" companies are just returning to earth in line with their actual earnings values instead of speculative values because of cheap cash. Cash itself is losing value because of Keynesian economics. The actual market of things is being threatened by humans fighting (happens all the time) The only thing special, if I were to think of a special element of this particular time, is you are just bombarded with much more information than people in the past had, so it just makes things happen faster. And more public. You get more exposure to the idiots who run things, like Masayoshi Son or Elon Musk. Witness the human race in all of it's glory, and buy calls because we have always been this dumb and it's always worked in the end.

It was the drug they touted on their earnings call a couple of weeks ago.  It's marketed (for now and down the road as a weight loss medication) as a Type 2 diabetes drug to lower your A1C.  The massive benefit is for the 20mg dose, the average weight loss was 21.6% Bodyweight, or 52# on average for the test group.  72 week study with over 2500 participants.  Once a week injection.This will be bigger than Viagra.  Viagra is just for men.  Men AND Women are obese in the US and the world.  It's the holy grail.  It's what everyone has wanted since the 80's.  Give me a shot once a week and I'll lose 50#.  Estimates are it'll be a $30B drug by 2030.  It has one other competitor out there that starts with an 'O', but my notes aren't in front of me so I don't remember, but this is more effective.

Markets are going down.If people had the real numbers on China \[because why would they be telling the truth?\] it would be so much worse.It’s going to keep going down for the foreseeable future \[in my totally non-expert view\], a crash at this point would be like a Karen wanting to talk to the manager when the store is already on fire.Corollary: why are you smart asses nagging about the stock market going down?

Some of the US gigacap tech for example, or raw materials producers.Just need patience and to find companies that have earnings that can afford to drop, growth that can stall, and still be ok investments.

I don't have the patience for that, start selling long dated puts on companies with low PE and robust cash flow. Not enough to tie up the majority of your capital, just to take the edge off waiting. If market continues to dump, the premium will likely make up for the majority of it. More likely, the solid low PE companies go sideways (like they often do even through recessions), and you keep the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 04:31:53'] SOFI is a solid company? They're a bank that's been around for over a decade and can't turn a profit.  Your local credit union is a more "solid" company.  SOFI is still a growth company, and in a market where investors aren't willing to wait another decade for profits, of course they're getting slaughtered.Timing the perfect bottom is a fool's errand and if you could do it you would be the greatest trader anywhere, ever, by far.  You're not.  So incrementally but as it goes down, knowing in X years you'll be sitting pretty no matter what.  Would you really be upset if you had bought 1,000 shares of TSLA back when it was $60, then dropped to $30, if you held through the years (and splits)?These markets make fortunes, and it's not the people dumping 100% of their loads at drop dead bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 05:31:40'] Oil.  Over the past decade+ oil has been counter cyclical.  I don’t see oil going down in the next couple years with the whole Russia Ukraine thing.

MRNA is the best long term investment from the widely vaccines available, did you know it cost £20 per dose? And paid by government?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 16:54:13'] This is not a great study to draw the conclusions you are trying to draw. It says it itself if you actually go to the source and not the sensationalized journalism:>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\*\*\* MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.††† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-01 05:08:41'] Vaccines don’t prevent you from being infected period. It doesn’t matter which strain it is. People have the misconception they’re immune because unfortunately that’s what doctors tend to label people who have good titers. However we have known since we started vaccination that the premise of the vaccine is to prevent severe symptoms, ICU, and death. The fact that symptomatic vaccinated patients have not been going to the icu or dying seems to suggest vaccine works against the delta variant

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:31:07'] Getting the vaccine was never supposed to make you never get an infection. It's to prevent severe infection. It gives your immune system a head start. The percentage of people being hospitalized with covid now are like 95% unvaccinated people. I don't think vaccinated individuals getting sick is going to shake the markets, especially if they are having only minor illness.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:21:38'] Market Black Swan, doubt it, Fed set a floor on the markets last year, per their statement as of last week, the floor remains intact. Doesn’t mean we won’t see any healthy pull backs.Black Swan IMO might be on population size if anything. Only victims will be the kids who are ineligible for vaccination or parents who chose not to be vaccinated & made the same decision for their offsprings.The conspiracy theory tards deny the same science that is used to make today’s technology, computers, iPhones you name it.  However, they will gladly use the technology because it’s convenient. Anything of inconvenience is an infringement on freedom. LMAOIt’s just a study of atoms, structures, reactions & energy.If one likes going against the general population, well then you would have taken Covid seriously since early last year when the general population ignored it. Now that the masses realize the complexity of a virus, now isn’t the time to be “against” the norm. Everyone has a right to choose to be or not to be vaccinated. Everyone has the right to choose if they wish to use their brain or not.  Perhaps the silver lining is a decrease in the tard population.Show me any part of the world with low education & I’ll show you a much higher concentration of tards in those areas: extremists, cults, conspiracy theorists, fanatics & fascists.  After all, it wasn’t that long ago people were burning witches.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:45:29'] Delta is the overwhelmingly most common variant in the UK right now, but it certainly doesn’t feel like anything that might cause a huge market crash.  Infection rates went quite high for a week or two after we removed all limits on social contact and most mandatory mask rules on 19 July, but infection rates are already going down.  Hospitalisations and deaths have remained low because we have vaccinated so many.  Honestly covid doesn’t feel like much of a threat any more.  More damage was done to the economy by an overblown reaction to the disease than the disease itself, and I don’t think the govt would impose a lockdown again as public sentiment is now so heavily in favour of just getting on with our lives.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 13:44:18'] Anti-vaccine and electoral madness aside, is anyone else feeling like mRNA vaccines are beginning to look like a bit of a con job? Why weren’t inactivated virus vaccines given EUA? The data from Israel, whose vaccine strategy was very much like ours, suggests  the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is reduced by 1/2 every 3-4 weeks. Now, I’m not saying that there are dishonest players in big pharma who used their lobbying clout to get Pfizer a 27B deal for a questionable product, but it seems as Pfizer lobbyists perhaps used their clout in DC to get a 27B deal for a questionable product, and now they are pushing for booster shots for a vaccine that perhaps doesn’t work that well. Inactivated Virus vaccines create t-cells that can ward off infection potentially for years. Also, antivax people can’t shout weird things about genetic modifications with these vaccines. What I’m saying, actually, is I’m buying OCGN calls on Monday. Covaxin is likely getting WHO approval this month, they have a manufacturing plant set up in US,  they have the right to sell in Canada who will perhaps provide doses to the rest of the world. So even if the FDA is as cognitively deficient as joe biden himself and we don’t get Covaxin, that Stock is gonna pump with WHO approval and then I’m moving to Europe while the US turns into the Last of Us.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 12:02:14'] Paxlovid works like the AIDS drugs and destroys rogue genetic segments, something like drano cleaning the pipes, it does not actually destroy infected cells, or prevent them infecting neighbouring cells.It's almost certain that Biden tested negative because the PCR test couldn't match any of the destroyed fragments to the disease, but once he stopped taking Paxlovid, it all came back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 13:56:19'] Completely different drugs. The main drive of Sabizabulin is for people long past what paxlovid is authorized for (even though paxlovid, like remdesevir before it, is handed out like condoms and candy at the adolescent health clinic.)

I'd argue that we will see a March like recovery in Value tickers sometime next year, while growth naturally contracts.I think you are a gay bear crash prophet and while you eventually be right, you will not be able to accurately time the big one.

The timing burned me pretty badly but I still think the theories are correct.My advice to you guys is to use a debit spread on VXX calls to limit damage from theta a tiny bit and to also make the expiration longer than a few weeks, though the US should be locking down to some extent by then which would serve as a solid catalyst.  Good post overall, made more sense than variation separate ever did, all that guy was good at was formatting in reddit markdown.I’ll say VXX 22/25C Debit sometime in january.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 07:19:20'] Have some problems with this DD. The first is who creates money in the modern economy? See this:[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)So commercial banks create money in the modern economy when the bank creates a loan on its books. Commercial banks literally create money out of thin air. The money is ‘extinguished‘ when the loan is repaid to the bank. The only role of the central bank (read the Fed in US) in the modern economy is to control the ambient interest rates. Controlling the interest rates controls the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans. High interest rates tend to decrease the issuing of new loans by the commercial banks whereas low interest rates tend to encourage the issuing of new loans. ie the money supply. If the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans matches the rate at which the economy is expanding, then all is well. Interest rates can remain relatively low and everyone feels relatively prosperous. If this process overheats, interest rates are too low, the economy is not expanding to match, then the result is inflation.What however happens if the central bank has already reduced interest rates to near zero in an unsuccessful attempt to get commercial banks to write new loans and thereby ‘stimulate’ the economy?This is how we now get to QE. See:[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing)(BTW this explanation of QE has been significantly altered by the BoE recently. It used to describe QE as ‘asset purchasing’ by the central bank)Quote:‘In addition, QE can stimulate the economy by boosting a wide range of financial asset prices.Suppose we buy £1 million of government bonds from a pension fund. In place of the bonds, the pension fund now has £1 million in money. Rather than hold on to this money, it might invest it in financial assets, such as shares, that give it a higher return. And when demand for financial assets is high, with more people wanting to buy them, the value of these assets increases. This makes businesses and households holding shares wealthier – making them more likely to spend more, boosting economic activity.’For ‘government bonds’ read US Treasuries. The pension fund reference is very telling: by far the largest pool of ‘dumb’ money anywhere. In the US the Fed has not just been buying Treasuries but corporate bonds. Corporate debt. Mortgage backed securities- MBS. Who knows what else in secret through the plunge protection team.Money has entered the real economy in the shape of unemployment protection payments and direct stimulus checks. This has not been matched by any GDP activity - or grossly reduced activity. It has been ‘paid for’ by increasing the total national debt. It’s a miracle it has not been inflationary, but people are wary of spending. They are buying durables like washing machines, microwaves and cars. Where ever they can they are paying down unsecured debt. Those with an excess are banking it or - buying stocks!Not sure if M2 money supply has gone up or down, but velocity is way down. M2 velocity really matters.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)TLDR: You’re wrong. \[Edit: short term you are right, long term wrong\] . The Fed has indirectly inflated all asset classes including stocks and housing market. Money printer can go brrrr some more - much more. Of course, the further it goes, the more spectacular the crash. The only question is whether the Fed has the balls or the US Govt allows it. Or the rest of the world calls the US bluff. My feeling is we are reaching one of those break point.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 06:30:01'] The economy is fucked for all the reasons you listed. I am not confident that will translate to a large sell-off in the markets.Premise 4: People have been saying this since March. The theory makes sense to my smooth brain but we haven't seen crazy deflation, liquidity isn't a problem for corporations, and markets have continued to rally.Contracting credit in general: Credit markets are contracting for *consumers*. Corporate bond yields are still at all-time lows, even junk bonds. Publicly traded companies are having no trouble getting extremely cheap money and the Fed is ready to buy trillions more in bonds should they need to. JPow still has Robinhood on his phone and will buy all the junk bond ETFs he needs to at a moment's notice. Institutions know this and have way over-extended in the corporate bond markets because they think the Fed will bail them out (and the Fed has ruined the yields of safer assets). This means the Fed will *have* to bail out corporate bonds, because if they don't shit will blow up even bigger than if they'd done nothing in March. Yeah everything is real bad for normies, but stonks have little to do with the real economy and that's been especially true for the last few years.Premise 6: Banks are always buying bonds. The question is if bond buying has increased lately. [The rate of bond purchases accelerated in March and has kept the same pace through the face-ripping rally off the lows](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TASACBW027SBOG). However in mid/late October it's accelerated even more. So, there's a chance there's something to this.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 10:03:31'] One of the dumbest things I see on WSBs is bearish posts telling us how dumb retail investors are the only ones being bullish/buying stocks. If you think the totality of retail investors are exclusively or are the majority reason driving stock growth you're a fucking moron. Hedge funds and banks are constantly shifting around tens of billions worth of instruments every day. When (eg) Tesla booms like it did this week it's because hedges are buying collosal fuck tons of stock and calls, probably to cover short positions. Big money makes huge plays all the time and that's what drives markets.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 13:01:02'] u/StevenVanMetre  Great post, seems pretty spot on.  I suspect after the election is when things will really start to head down.  Do you understand that the banking system works on whats called "fractional reserve system"?  When the FED injects those extra reserve assets, it allows the banks to create an 10x extra that amount of money they hold on their balance sheets. So if the FED injects 1million into a commercial banks reserve assets, it essentially allows the commercial bank to loan out, or use up to 10million in assets. That's how the FED indirectly prints money.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-22 17:53:39'] Might be the most interesting post on WSB. Fed Balance Sheet has flatlined past few months as well. Bullish sentiment at AAII is also at a ST high. All indications of a market top but vaccine EUA may put a floor under market and your puts may get fucked by theta. Also the EUA and vaccine may just continue rotation into value and cyclicals like XOM, TAP, DIA, INTC and others. Lastly traditionally the market rallies after Thanksgiving through year end. I think you are a little early. My guess is that there will be setbacks with vaccine distribution in the new year and the market will tank in January after a modest holiday rally.

That's right son.This is exactly why the market keeps going up.  IF everyone was long like in 2000.... we'd be in a bubble.  Amazon was a bubble stock at $200... and if everything is a bubble.. is it really a bubble or that fact that all boats are rising.The economy is not the stock market.  The FED may not be able to openly PRINT money... but money supply - yes the amount of money in circulation HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER....  never!! and its a coordinated effort around the globe.Money has neve been cheaper.  Mortgage rates at an all time low.  Central Banks hell bent on keeping their feet on the gas pedal.  The government ready to dole out more money to everyone.  You could surely craft a bearish perspective.  No doubt.However we got the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes.  And the stock market rallied to to new record highs.Exclamation point.  end of sentence.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 21:41:58'] Your knowledge is kinda impressive for not being in the finance field. Let’s just take a second to remember that you’re one market participant in a giant market full of idiots and other way smarter people and some in between who know enough to be really dangerous .. and you should be humbled when thinking of how you’re like a few grains of sand in the ocean or similarly like the size of your bedroom compared to the universe. Whether an idiot or a smart market participant — predictions like these are more likely than not to age poorly. The reason I say this is because it seems you spent so much time trying to be smart in explaining stuff to a bunch of idiots. Why would a smart person do this...? Well I don’t know. But while I’m here I thought I’d add my 2¢:Your premise #4 on QE being deflationary could be correct in the long term (Japan probably best example) but it can also be inflationary in the short term. The short term pressures are related to the velocity of money which comes down to bank lending. As you mentioned when the Fed buys securities it increases bank reserves and inflationary pressure would only occur if the banks lend that money out so the velocity of money is limited by banks lending abilities and risk tolerance. Right now banks are drowning in deposits and aren’t able to earn much by lending out money — plus they have to be very careful in this environment not to make bad loans with such a small net interest margin and unemployment still elevated at historical levels. Needless to say there are many factors that make it seem like the velocity of money is low. But if these vaccines succeed and nothing else gets all fucked up it seems there could be a scenario (not sure of probability) where things get back to “normal” fairly quickly after that.. and if that happens we could be shifting from a pandemic-lockdown-deflationary-contracting-environment to a more-inflationary-expansionary-environment. And now let’s just take a second to recognize how no one knows fucking shit... :):)

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 11:20:55'] Glad you are the person I’m trading against. A lot of stupid comments. According to your premise 1 you would’ve missed out of the run up of stocks in the last decade. Also, ever consider that the long-term low interest rate environment (with signaling that it will continue to be like this) fundamentally causes valuation multiples to re-rate? That’s the problem with historical analysis, the world is fundamentally different now. So why are multiples expanding? Because interest rates are low and investors need to reach for riskier and risked investments to maintain rates of return. Essentially chasing yield. Investors go for treasury to IG to HY to blue chip and beyond. By your logic, you would’ve gotten out of the market in 2015 waiting for the dip, which didn’t come until the pandemic five years later and you still would’ve been worse off lol. I’ve seen so many people try to time markets and it’s hilarious to watch. Take another page out of Buffett/Graham’s handbook and think about mr market. Do you need to sell now? Think about it as owning a business instead of a stock and you make much better decisions. FYI, you think Buffett is out of the market now? HahaWhile the ‘market’ has become over valued, look at why. The breadth of the recent run up from covid has been extremely narrow. Almost all of the run up has been in only a handful of stocks- FAANGM. Take a look at the market valuation excluding these stocks and you will see a great opportunity. As vaccine optimism works its way into the rest of the market, you will see a rotation to value and cyclical stocks and likely out of tech. What does that do to overall valuation of the market? Who is to say.It will probably keep it flattish, but bigger names will have less influence on the overall market as the capital will be dispersed to the rest of the market. Running on vaccine fumes is a joke, where do you think the market will be in March when the vaccine is in the process of rolling out?When people say the fed is printing money it’s because it’s effectively true. They are increasing the money supply by purchasing newly issued treasuries from banks. It credits the banks, which is treated like cash even though it doesn’t print cash. The cash is considered bank reserves, but banks only are required to hold a specific amount of reserves so all extra is used to maximize profit through lending/purchasing of long duration assets. You highlighted increasing amounts in high quality securities. Go down to line 9 oh they are increasing loans and leases as well. Oh and that number is 2x the size of treasury and agency securities lmao. Premise 5: feds funds are entering the market that is why you are seeing the markets stabilize (that downward tick). Banks don’t just hold the reserves in hand. They lose out on yield. Even if they are buying bonds, lending, etc. that money enters the economy. Sure they may be holding more reserves than before, but that is natural in a pandemic! Premise 7: the market is forward looking and most of the unemployment is viewed as temporary. As the pandemic drags on, more and more losses will become permanent, but they will be nowhere near as high as ‘08. Probably shake out somewhere around 6%. Again, glad you are the person on the other side of the table. FYI, I work professionally in the markets.

To hedge I am placing my puts in April.  That’s about when people think the vaccine will make life return to normal because they have totally forgotten that we had a huge anti-vaccine pandemic in America before this whole thing started and also, people don’t understand how a vaccine for a virus works.  This thing has already mutated and a virus vaccine is a precise thing.  We have at least 3 strands out here.Edit: never mind with this ramble.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 11:56:05'] @op this analysis seems pretty spot on, however, i believe it’s dependent on Biden not being able to pass a multi trillion stimulus bill, and the moderna and Pfizer vaccines not being implemented in the next few months.  If one or both of these things happen, the market should avoid a crash.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 12:21:19'] Good post. Not happening tho. We are heading up, stop the nonsense bear talk and deal with it. Between vaccines, new president, and companies continuing to beat earnings idk how you could say otherwise. Is there scared bears out there? yes, can they move the market a bit? Sure, but we are heading up. We could have a slight 10% drop, then hang on for all time highs.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 12:51:32'] > As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations. Lol no. You can’t just fucking say it keeps rejecting new highs when we just made one, and then say “ok but that was a one off”. It could very well test and break it again. What if it breaks 3660 on some other stimulus vaccine need? “Ok but its just another one off that was rejected, won’t happen again.” It’s overvalued but very likely your timing is way off.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 14:57:19'] The Fed has created the illusion that risk no longer exists because they will simply backstop any bad thing that happens with regard to liquidity and corporate credit. While I think that the actions they took in February and March were necessary they also created a massive equity bubble and have done nothing to temper it because there’s simply no political will for short term pain or disappointing Wall Street.Powell learned this lesson in Q4 of 2018 when the mere idea of raising rates sent the market spiraling down and had everyone attacking him. In a way this environment was inevitable after that and I think when we do finally crash and come out of this period that time will be viewed as the precursor to this absurd market completely divorced from reality or earnings.One additional point about valuations- yes P/Es are historically insane, sentiment is at an extreme level across the board- even bears have largely capitulated now- speculation is extremely high in the dumb money crowd. But there’s another indicator that is also a tell on this and that is the number of secondary offerings which is very elevated. This can be interpreted as a bearish contrarian indicator because it’s another sign of a high amount of speculative activity. Companies that need to raise capital find a public more than willing to give it to them.Also there’s a very popular narrative about seasonality being bullish and even if a selloff happens it won’t be until well into the new year so a contrarian argument could be made that we get a large selloff before EOY.Finally, price wise, the most bearish factor is that the stocks that led this bull market- mainly the fangs- have completely topped out and to use your term seem to be running on fumes. Apple, Amazon, etc. made their last high on September 3rd and still haven’t come close to retaking it. They are no longer in a bull market and while a number of people I follow view this action as a consolidating base for further upside, I believe the next big money will be made shorting these stocks.For me, I’m not a permabull or permabear either, but every one of my indicators regarding sentiment and valuations is screaming sell. The same indicators that told me to start getting short in January. I follow a number of people in fintwit whose sentiment is off the charts and are solidly in euphoric territory. I started talking about this two weeks ago. I’m positioned for a major correction/crash by mid January. We shall see. As a bear trying to time a top it hurts like shit until you finally cross the apex and start coming down the other side. Then it’s all worthwhile. These idiots who are in denial or like to say shit like “bears have called 30 of the last two crashes” don’t realize that 1) virtually every permabull gives back everything they made in the bull market and then some because they can’t resist the obvious dip buying opportunities on the way down before they finally capitulate and find a new passion in life (which is why they don’t outperform the s&p in the long run) and 2) a bear only needs to be right once and will make 10x what the bulls make.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 07:50:10'] I generally agree, but the window for this is small. First, the fed has never truly tapered, just slightly, the fed balance sheet stayed up through like 2012, and they really can’t unload anything without crashing the market. Second, the moment dollar velocity picks up, the market will moon, in real terms? No, just that $4T of money supply will hit it hard and a beer will cost $10 even in poorer parts of America. So your dates look prime, maybe even go 12/31 or first week of January for a bit more time. After that we get stimulus, then shutdown, or vice versa. And you may as well be throwing darts IMO. Also I like your $350 strike for the downside. This sounds retarded, because it is but SPY 12/31 $350p, SPY 6/30 or later $450c. The only thing that’ll keep inflation down is if foreign countries buy USD like crazy and given we have been a shitshow that may not happen as it has in the past.

Also, there are economies out there other than the US. Some of them are even doing pretty well at dealing with the whole COVID thing. Major flaws in the thesis.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 09:08:09'] This is high quality content. I read through the entire post. DD is top notch and would agree that the markets are highly overvalued. I’ll keep holding on to my investments regardless of what occurs. Im just bit buying for now.I may do some put options for the first time since March in a month or so.

POST_TEXT: b'* **Forecast for this week** (see full details on financials further down)\n\nThis week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.\n\nPfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.\n\n'

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 08:22:15'] But the market already knows almost exactly how much BNTX made from the PFE earning, since PFE does break out the vaccine earnings, and BNTX makes almost exactly same as PFE since they have a 50/50 profit split agreement.BNTX already rallied right after PFE earning, but was beaten down again by the news of covid pill from PFE. I don't think BNTX's own earning will have any real effect on its price. Though a rally could still happen simply due to it has went down so much already, bottom buyers may buy in, and indeed a good earning, even though already well known by the market, may be a catalyst.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-12 15:31:52'] Oh, this thread starts off with "not financial advice" must be good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-12 14:42:21'] So I read most of your post as a case of benefit of doubt but gave up once you started using numbers and it looked more like a pitch to join an MLM...I did look up o'leary as suggested and I do agree with his viewpoint however I interpret his statement differently from you.I agreed with Kevin O'Leary that it could work as a business becuase in truth there really are millions of people who would love to hear trumps voice.And yes, i do agree that there is a large scope from O' learys viewpoint becuase no one really knows what else this platform can do becuase no one really said what it was going to be. But that's from the point of view of it being a viable business. Being a viable business however doesn't really mean the share price is even close to it being something to buy unless it triggers a YOLO urge. And that probably won't happen until this share is shorted to hell.It's only been around since late Feb. There's basically zero proof on its ability to monetize or at least monetize consistently. The downloads were impressive at the beginning but its basically down to about 95%. So I guess the fans who wanted it already have it. Similarly the daily users have dropped to a few 100,000s.Now don't get me wrong I'm not talking about the politics involved.. but just from the viewpoint of it as a business itself. Its viable. So yeah u can go long on it and it could probably be something of value in 5 -10 years if run well. But my advice is go long only if u can get the share for less than a few bucks. Right now, the only thing that could really assign some value to this company are actually the consumers it represents. However, I don't think the current 1.4 billion market cap is something that could withstand multiple correction phases once the normal routine of submitting Financial reports sets in. And one last thing... money doesn't respect politics and political views... money only cares about whether it can grow. And, Politics is just one of many tools for money to do so. Not advice blah blah.. at own risk.. blah blah blah.

	COMMENT: ['2016-04-06 00:09:17'] So, I bought AGN today based on the fact it is trading at approx. $18 lower than it was before the merger idea was either floated or announced.  Why would this trade lower than $235?
	COMMENT: ['2016-04-06 00:49:28'] Ask Cramer to give your money back, he is the one who motivate everyone to get into this unfinished deal.
	COMMENT: ['2016-04-05 19:56:58'] I heard that because Pfizer is terminating the merger, Allergan gets like 400m is compensation (someone said 4b, but i don't think it's that much). Allergan was doing fine before the merger talks anyway, so I think they could be a bargain at this price.
	COMMENT: ['2016-04-05 19:02:19'] Interesting....the more I look at Allergen, the more they resemble Valeant in certain ways (lots of promise, little delivery). Would be interested if this failure had something to do with Pfizer getting cold feet.

The Fed has 2 priorities: (1) Maximum employment (2) Price Stability and low inflation. Everything else is secondary.\n2. Markets have priced in a 2x taper by March ish, a 2-3 rate hike in 2022.\n3. Omicron hasn't caused lockdowns YET, except it most likely will due to the 2x transmisibility. Although Omicron is 90% less severe, and vaccines still work 70-75% for hospitalisations, Omicron is a wildcard. The International Energy Agency predicted a reduced demand for oil due to Omicron as well just a few days back.\n4. Pfizer's 89% pill's final data is reasonable. Possible FDA approval end of year.\n5. Maximum employment seems to have been reached since 4.2% (4.5% expected)"

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-15 03:51:43'] Interesting DD. If he did raise rates now it would cause the market to panic-sell, so I definitely don’t expect a December rate raise.My assumption is that he will do what he said he would do: double-speed the tapering so that it finishes at the end of March 2022. Then in 2022 he will announce a 0.25% interest rate hike and the exact number and timing is going to depend on how inflation is between now and then, how the supply chain issues are resolving, if Omicron is overflowing the hospitals and killing lots of people / causing shutdowns (whether the gov’t mandates it or not, a good portion of people will choose to stay home / voluntarily shut themselves down if the hospitals are full and tons of people are dying.)I don’t see how the used car prices will come down any time soon, because the chip shortage is a bottleneck for producing new cars. Also if people are getting big raises because of inflation, businesses will raise their prices (aka cause inflation) and that becomes the basis for more raises. Inflation could get “stuck” around 7% if businesses and employees start expecting that to be the inflation level, which would mean that JPow would eventually need to go full Volker and cause a brief recession to knock out the inflation.However, this economy has been addicted to low rates and QE since the Great Recession, and I’m not sure it could handle the kind of rapid rate raises it would take to tackle inflation. It could put a lot of zombie companies out of business, and those companies employ many millions of people, thus running up against the other half of the dual mandate which is full employment. Longer term I do think it’s best to get off of QE and get rates back up.

Monday might recover.If it's good, well +X% today, tomorrow Friday some subsiding.Since I'm a novice in trading, just treat my post as a combination of datapoints from everywhere - you still need to make up your own mind. I'm just reporting the facts with some general whole economic opinions.I just feel somewhat uneasy with a possible 4 rate increase, and not a 3.

If FOMC doesn't scare the market beyond what's expected, majority of these puts will meet their inevitable worthlessness (IV drops post FOMC, Vanna decays delta and as we get closer to Friday Theta and subsequently Charm decay as well.)Now, with all these puts expiring worthless, MM will have to unwind their equally large hedges, meaning they'll have to buy to cover their existing short positions which could be the precursor to the so called Santa Rally.

This headline is populist and idiotic. I, for one, agree that “free speech” needs some rules. We have seen what happens when anyone can blurt out any nonsense to an audience of millions. People die. A-holes like Trump, Carlson and Rogan have kept people from protecting themselves properly from Covid, to name just one thing. And please don’t confuse the freedom to say whatever you want with democracy. The richest man on the planet owning the “free speech platform” is supposed to strengthen democracy? My ass. This Elon worship is coming from the same people who blame the media for everything, and who think that Bezos, Gates and Soros are somehow running the whole world with their money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-25 15:27:44'] Free Speech and having a public platform (i.e. a president) are not equitable. A person can say whatever he/she wants. A person who has a public platform and knowingly says something that is false is not entitled to the same freedom of speech that a non-public person has. A platform wielding public person has followers and if he/she knowingly says false things to gain, manipulate the followers then that free speech has now crossed the lines to manipulation and possible chaos driven… such as January 6th When the people giving the speeches were knowingly lying.

NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01.

Fundamentally speaking that\'s how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn\'t make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF\'s decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.\n\nLet just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF\'s "Bull '

It accumulated some more at 3, and then it jumped another 50% to 4.50 IT then stayed at 4.50-5.00 for a few days until the AH on Tuesday the 26th when it finally broke out over the 5 resistance and that's when a lot of people started chasing.It ended AH at \~8. It then hit over 25 in PM the next morning before selling off to 13. It then steadily climbed back to \~!9.90 during the day before having a small sell off going into AH and then another recovery. In PM it went over 23.And on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 08:41:37'] I’m no pro but I don’t believe there’s a bull trap. The stock plummeted because Robinhood (and I believe a few other brokerages) kicked the legs out from under everyone and halted buying on AMC and GME. Only selling.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 10:47:43'] 910 shares of $AMC been holding since $4 and bought more at $5.70 The thesis for $AMC is amazing. The bull trap means it was shorted more. So it’s shorted to high hell. This is why other funds jumped in with us. So good squeeze potential Great mid to long term play. Vaccines and a lot of demand for theaters in a post pandemic world. The memes speak to thisGreat long play as a lot of movies are yet to be played because they didn’t wanna release them for small profits in a world without theater revenueGreat American Business and we know how much that matters to people. Plus management focused on reinventing the movie experience to become more of a event. With food and drinks 🍺 Nostalgia factor. We all have a good memory from the theaters. It’s just a all around safe play for the long term and a even better play in the short term because if you pussies HOLD and don’t sell at the first sign of profits we compound multiple gamma squeezes and run these shorts to utter bankruptcy. And you have a fail safe if they try to tank the market like last time. It’s in my opinion a stronger thesis than $GME and I’m seriously all in on it cause wellI LIKE THE STOCK Also NOT A DEAD CAT

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 10:20:48'] So on January 27th Silver Lake sold 45M brand new AMC shares to you fucking idiots at an average price of $16 a share. $713M of newly dilutive shares sold. They completely top ticked the market in a trade they will be laughing about for years. If you bought at $20 you paid a hedge fund like $15 a share more then you should have. Float increased by another 15% in a day. AMC sold 63M shares that week. That’s why the rally didn’t last, not RH. http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/5fe2dc45-30a6-4e45-8c67-36015d973df1.pdf

All our family just signed up for their AMC Stubs A-List. It's like 20 bucks per month and you can watch up to 3 movies per week IMAX, 3D, etc + receive VIP treatment + get discounts on their stuff, etc. One AMC movie ticket here in Miami is like $18 bucks + taxes... So, it's a HUGE savings for us! We go to movies every week, and I'm sure many of you are starting to go again! Let's take their shares to the moon! If all us shareholders buy their plan, we will see a big difference in the near future.  The same goes to GME folks, but their stuff in their stores (online and physical), forget about AMZN Their shares are already in the moon! Our mission is to take AMC and GME to the moon now!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 10:44:00'] I understand that closing at $8.01 means a bunch more contracts ended in the money. I'm hoping someone can shed some light on my thoughts, wouldn't the people with $8 options lose money once you factor in the strike price and option cost? If so, would it make sense for them not to exercise the option or would they exercise because they think the stock will increase from $8.01 which would justify the $8 price?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 09:47:19'] GME - under value? How does a brick and mortar gaming retail store chain have intrinsic value higher than 120 when one it's been stuck at 30 dollars for the past half a decade and two its quarterly profits and revenue matches it's decline and lack of purpose and utility in the modern age.  I like physical media and being able to buy things in person, but Best Buy far outmatches in those terms. Gamestop is too selective about what it sells. Maybe if it kept more than just a drawer full of old games, didn't rip me off on returns and the employees took showers lmao it would be worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 11:18:15'] Nearly anyone who had Calls at $8 used them Wednesday / Thursday at the spike.  No one was sitting there watching the stock go up from $7.50 up to $8 holding calls, "wishing" it would get to $8.01 so they'd be ITM.  If they really believed it would get to $8, they'd have bought at $7.50 and saved 0.50 a shared. I want the price to go up as I own shares above current market value.  It closing at $8.01 vs $7.99 made very little difference other than in people's minds.  If it had reached $8.25, you could have seen more execution.  Who is going not buy at $7.50, but execute at $8.01 and then hold all weekend?   No one in mass.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 02:22:34'] You have your logic the wrong way round. Increasing burglaries should result in more people taking out policies and any claims made will just increase premiums. Insurance companies won't just suck up having reduced profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 03:24:24']   When we have a hurricane outbreak affecting multiple entire states or a 7+ earthquake..yes.  150 homes being robbed ina confined area is concerning at a local level but otherwise, barely a blip on the radar.  You might do some research to see what happened in 2004 when 4 hurricanes whacked florida.  2005 Katrina/Rita/Wilma affected Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Some insurance companies were so badly damaged they left some of those states entirely.  Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 02:56:26'] Shorting life insurance companies is a better trade, post mrna injections they're seeing >40% increase in claims in all countries with high injection rates. Metlife is heavy into life insurance. They're going to be suing pharma companies, I think some litigation already started so there's a play there too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 03:11:32'] You talk like it's only a single insurance company that operates in the area and that area alone.They'll be dozens of operators and they'll sell policies all over the state and country. And if claims go up so do the premiums for people in that area code.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 04:25:22'] I have 613 shares buy in is 103$ if you compare to Moderna there is a huge upside potential. The main reason I bought it, the vaccine last longer then the mRNA. Also there is a brought immune response to other variants. So in my opinion they have the best vaccine on the market. Covid is here to stay. Just wait for winter when the cases are rising again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 21:50:01'] there's definitely something fucky going on with NVAX. Seemed like the FDA were giving preferential treatment to the competitors. But it climbed to 71 in anticipation of the FDA announcement only to drop hard immediately after. I think the same thing will happen with the CDC announcement.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-20 06:23:56'] As far as I can tell omicron is a “catalyst”, rather an excuse that’s over exaggerated to cause a market dump that isn’t gonna be blamed on the Fed tapering so we don’t have to admit that we were a bubble. There’s obviously going to be more positive cases because more people are getting tested, the variant is more contagious but nothing has been said about it being more deadly if anything it’s “mild.”This isn’t going to be a flash crash like covid and I doubt we’ll see large scale lockdowns. It will be a slow bearmarket till the bubble is deflated enough for comfort. The fed as far as I can tell, has zero plans of printing again and admits they overprinted last time. Im buying the dip in stocks who have been hurt by inflation and shorting ones benefitting from it.

	COMMENT: ['2015-11-23 07:20:29'] There's a thing called merger arbritrage where institutions will go short the company doing the buying and go long on the company being bought out to realize the spread.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 08:24:14'] Genomics tells us that omicron did not evolve from a recent variant. Instead it evolved either from the original virus or the alpha variant. There are two ways that this could’ve occurred. An immuno compromised individual may have had a prolonged infection that allowed for multiple mutations to occur over months or even a year or longer. Alternatively the virus jumped to an animal which was able to infect other animals of its species creating a reservoir of the virus. The C19 virus has been shown to infect multiple other animals, including cats & dogs however, other than minks no other animal spread the infection to other animals of their species creating a coronavirus animal reservoir. A recent study showed strong evidence that a South African mouse reservoir of SARS-Cov-2  was the source of the Omicron Variant. Animal reservoirs create multiple mutations in the coronavirus, if the virus jumps back to humans as Omicron did, the virus produces profound immune escape. The bad news is that Whitetail deer in the Midwest have also created a SARS-Cov-2 reservoir. The coronavirus is guaranteed to mutate in this reservoir as well. When the virus jumps back to humans, expect a new source of multiple worrisome mutations. Mouse reservoirs of the coronavirus in South Africa & white tailed deer reservoirs in the Midwest indicate that we are not done with the coronavirus & future worrisome variants. The pandemic is not over; buckle your seatbelts we’re in for a bumpy ride!

FYI, it really isn't unusual for a company to have sales/yr be very close to their market cap. It makes perfect sense, if revenue/year is \~5% and a generic P/E market average is 20ish...But without looking at them for more than 3 minutes and the DD you provided I wouldn't be opposed to placing a bet on them. For me, IV would have to be substantially lower, I would only go in for shares at this point and stay out of options, which it appears you are opting for.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 12:59:46'] well, well well.. never seen anything go high and go low so fast as OCGN did today. I got in yesterday (monday Oct 25) and at one point today, I was sitting at 51% gain (when it hit 13). I was busy at work and check now after some hours all todays gain are gone, and it is sitting at 9.16. That is a 30% drop within few hours. There is no confirmed news, but some rumours that WHO may have asked OCGN further documentation before approval.By the way, OP, hope you managed to sell a bit when it was trading at 13.

But with $NVAX delay, $OGCN will take their market share and supply emerging markets."Would just like to point out what a collosal fail this post is. There is no Novavax delay, we just applied for EUA in the UK today. There IS, however, a Bharat delay, they got a "talk to the hand" from the WHO yesterday. Bear in mind, the WHO application has NOTHING to do with Ocugen, which does not have any sales agreements at all, much less any commercialization rights in any countries that give a flying fuck about the WHO. Lastly, you can't supply what you don't produce, and Ocugen is currently producing... nothing.So, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. Nice job.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 07:07:47'] Interesting... but i'm not sure suboxone is comparable to 18-MC. Suboxone represses withdrawal symptoms by acting kind of like an opioid, so people need to come back for more and it always works. Psychedelics affect every different, and it's being sold as a "cure", so sales would not correlate to suboxone.

The process they are developing is unique and with FDA approval would have some value but I don't see how they easily monetize it before others move in to the space once proven.

Suboxone is a horrible drug I think one of the worst. People don’t realize what a difference a short acting vs long acting opioid can do to someone...the suboxone (long acting) does damage long term
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 06:59:14'] Why does the description on Robinhood say this is MiniMed and it makes diabetic supplies?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 08:40:44'] Finishing my doctorate in clinical psychology (one year away, woo!) and am very interested in this approach to treatment.  I fully anticipate opening a practice that utilizes psychedelics in the future but it's many years off until that actually occurs.  The first psychedelic expected to be granted regulatory approval is MDMA through the MAPS organization because they're the furthest along in the phase 3 FDA trial but it's not even expected to clear these hurdles until 2025.  MAPS is also a nonprofit and will likely be able to drastically undercut MNMD on prices for these substances in the future as long as MAPS gets there first in terms of clearing regulatory hurdles.  They'll already have approvals for MDMA under their belt by the time they move on to psilocybin (which they are already doing) and will likely be able to do the same undercutting for that substance as well.  Psilocybin is arguably the most exciting substance in this approach to treatment thus far and is incredibly cheap to produce- a profit-seeking company like MNMD will have a very difficult uphill battle to fight every step of the way.Pair this with the complete lack of knowledge about the efficacy of these treatments by the vast majority of people in my field and you have a huge problem for MNMD.  I'm quite literally the only person in my program who ever discusses this approach to treatment- the faculty are completely unaware that this is a thing or only have tangential knowledge about what used to take place prior to the beginning of the "war on drugs."  This is going to radically shift approaches to mental health treatment but it's **a decade** away at least from being a reality in the grand scheme of things.  This approach to treatment currently requires special training as it's radically different from every other approach taught thus far.  There's simply no infrastructure in place for such a radical shift to occur in any sort of meaningful way that will make this company viable for a long, long time.

Although it's not a clinical trial, there have been [case studies](https://www.jsad.com/doi/full/10.15288/jsad.2020.81.115) on LSD overdoses with people taking 10-550 doses. Besides some vomiting (and losing touch with reality) for several hours, there were no long term negative health effects. In fact, there were actually positive effects, with one person having improvement with a mood disorder, even 20 years after the incident, and another getting relief from chronic pain. The other case was of a woman that did not know she was pregnant when ingesting the LSD and the child had a normal birth and no discernable health effects though adult life.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 11:08:34'] Here in the UK we had the Delta Wave, Government unlocked the country anyway. Now 80% Vax'd, hospitalisation way down, deaths almost non existent. This thing is here to stay and whilst people may still get it if you're vaxd it's very unlikely to be serious.World wide governments are prioritising economy.It would help if 40% of Americans didn't refuse to be vaccinated though. *rolls eyes*
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 06:11:42'] As someone with a hefty position in $AVIR, I think your outlook on COVID is way overly negative. This Delta wave will pass in the next month and everybody will have some type of immunity. Boosters will ensure infections don’t overwhelm hospitals. That doesn’t mean there isn’t a need for an oral therapeutic. I love Atea though because they have way more than just AT-527 and have a very solid pipeline. AT-527 will succeed, but they are more than just that. Additionally, their CEO has led companies that were purchased by Gilead and Merck for billions of dollars. It’s just a really solid company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 03:28:45'] Maybe, but have you considered that everyone vaccinated has probably had an asymptomatic infection with COVID-19 and produced a variety of antibodies to the virus at this point, not just the spike protein? This produces greater cross immunity between variants.You’re assuming everyone unvaccinated has no immunity which is not the case. It is unknown how many non vaccinated individuals have covid immunity from prior infections. There are many people who have had subclinical infections and sub-hospitalization infections with the original virus -both vaccinated and unvaccinated. The only way to really tell how much immunity is out there is to randomly antibody test people.I personally doubt anything will be as bad as last year because most people’s immune systems have seen some form of this covid lineage now, whereas back in March 2020 it was a completely novel lineage of coronavirus that humans had never been exposed to before.Good luck but I think the easy money covid train has left the station.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 03:37:10'] Viruses become less deadly the more they mutate, there’s no benefit in killing your host reservoir. Delta will fizzle out just like it did in India before being replaced by the next variant. There’s no crushing this virus, it’s endemic at this point

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 04:45:05'] Is this a reliable scientific source of info?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 06:38:21'] Skeptical on lockdowns. With all the fatigue, i think people are ready to take the pandemic on the chin. Meaning, vaxxed will accept up to 0.1% mortality, unvaxxed 1% mortality. For the US, assuming 50% vax rate, and 600k already dead, we have about 1M more dead to go. At which point herd immunity is achieved.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 09:05:02'] Here's what I don't get: Why are people lining up for these shots, especially now?1) The vaccine is *not* FDA approved.  It has an "Emergency Use" approval.2) It does nothing against the Delta variant.  Zero.  You can still get it.3) We don't even knkw who has it and who has the Flu.  The PCR test only tests for the antibodies and those are *identical* for both COVID and the Flu.  The test simply cannot tell you which one you have.  Ghey just call every case COVID because they get Fed $$$.The problem is that patients in hospitals are denied normal treatment if they develop pneumonia because what they have is actually the Flu.  What do you think happens to them, especially the elderly?Doesn't anybody wonder what happened to the Flu?As for the stock, the guy might be right about it, so I think I'll grab some. :-)

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 11:24:17'] You lost me at “I own SPY puts”. The only time spy puts ever printed was March 2020. You clearly don’t understand bond markets, interest rates,  Central Bank balance sheets, etc. If you did, you’d realize that it is a 1/30 chance that a managed index will go down enough to print your puts on any given day in such an inflationary environment. The fact that you don’t know this and still make bear plays on managed indexes that go up 70% of the time over any given 2 year period in history while getting crushed by theta the whole time makes me think your motive is fear. Fear is not how we make investment decisions. Hell, before I played puts in February it was due to institutional selling, but I knew about COVID in late October 2019 so I had the jump on you. You have no jump on any of this. Delta variant is common knowledge now. This is priced in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 06:57:29'] Areas that are highly vaccinated are not having nearly the same issues as the science deniers/faith based medicine jesus christ's cum guzzling idiots in the south (FL/TX).
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 08:19:53'] I have to agree with you to some extent. Weather you belive in a COV vaccine conspiracy or not. That's not the point. Because it doesn't matter what is real or not. This moment in history is here to stay. This is the money maker.  So this will be an ongoing time frame. I think we have only seen the beginning of COV.Thus this is just the prepping and most likely we will see more than a few mutations. This because the public needs to be brought down to a point when they see that there is absolutely no other choice but to comply.At point which we will see some kind of "savior" on a global level - leading the masses to a globalized mass vaccination - because they will have what it takes to solve a world problem. Now my question is. Why AVIR? Would AViR be the market leader in this field? They are not the only company taking on COV. And as I see it, there are other companies with deeper pockets.  No?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-11 08:45:16'] It won't unless some people believe in that COVID is real, Vaccination reduces the chance of death, masks works, and care about the economy as a whole.  We will be all impacted by a small portion of society. I really do not want to stay home, not to see family and friends, and/or see folks lose their jobs/homes, etc.

POST_TEXT: b"I want to give you some insight on BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX), a German biotechnology company that - especially in the US - often stays in the shadow behind Pfizer when speaking about Covid vaccines. Currently trading at about $295, I am super bullish for this company, both in the short-term as well as long.\n\nLooking at the chart, BNTX just finished its consolidation and is now back in a uptrend. When the resistances at $300 and $330 are broken (300 probably today), there's a lot upside potential as two major catalysts are approaching next week: Q3 ER and its participation at a oncology congress. Let's look at the two separately, as well as an outlook.\n\n\\-- As usually: I am by no means a financial expert, please do your own DD. --\n\n**Q3 ER**  \nIn the last quarters, BioNTech showed a pattern of crushing it's earnings estimations and after Pfizer topped its estimations significantly yesterday, so will BioNTech as they share profits 50:50. As a result, alone from this we could/should get clo"

This is a sleeping giant that’s about to wake up. Q3 earnings will be crushed, and if they truly found a treatment for cancer I can’t imagine how that will affect the SP.I’ve tried warning this sub for a month, not many listen. This is the play.

This would reduce the burden on companies in Mainz by 350 million euros in the coming year. In addition, the lowered tax rate should further improve the framework conditions for new biotech companies."

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ryqgub/moderna_is_probably_the_most_vulnerable_covid/'
POST_TEXT: b"Moderna is the example of a small company that has its entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA COVID vaccines. Before COVID, this company was on the brink of bankruptcy. As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.\nOn the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. "

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 21:01:14'] “… entire wealth built around one thing: mRNA…” Its like saying Tesla’s entire wealth is built around cars or Googles entire wealth is built around a search engine. MRNA is a game changing technology that can be used in more ways than many can imagine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 19:55:11'] Short MRNA, a company with no debt, tons of cash, and a cash cow vaccine/booster series, after it was hammered down by ~60% off of its high…. 🤔 I think this might just work. Let’s do it! <says only the retardest of the retards>

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 12:22:27'] You do realize the MASSIVE SUCCESS of their mRNA vaccine is proof of principle for their whole suite of therapeutics...this is an entirely new technology that they are one of the key players in...and you think they are going to fail?  Loads of cash and so many new uses.  I can't comment on the current valuation but they could (and have been) world changing
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 20:09:49'] You should seriously try to avoid letting your political biases influence your trading. I’m saying this seriously, because people lose a lot of money this way. Tony Fauci isn’t on the verge of some major disgraceful downfall. He’s on the verge of retirement. No one in the scientific community believes the covid vaccines are ineffective. There’s not going to be any information that will surface that will change that. Most importantly, Moderna still has to sell drugs to the entire undeveloped world and they’re in trials for a cancer vaccine.Shorting this company for the reasons you’ve outlined is absolutely fucking retarded. And not in a silly WSB sort of way. Like you’re a fucking idiot and you’re going to lose a lot of money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 20:30:27'] Evidence that Fauci holds moderna patents?Edit: Ban! Ban! Ban! *Ban!*

I’m not sure there’s one bit of fact anywhere in this post. mRNA is the technology used to create a vaccine and they have lots more than just Covid vaccines. Their website is a pretty good resource for their pipeline. But I mean good luck with your shorts. We welcome you to the loss porn club
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 19:50:41'] I don’t have the time to fact check this guy ^^, but pretty sure Fauci doesn’t have the patent.  Stop try to make money off the COVID hype!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 20:27:38'] If Moderna’s full pipeline develops to commercialization,  they could be the most valuable company on the planet.Maybe short term weakness, but long term this looks rich.
