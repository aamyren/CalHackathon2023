	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:04:59'] lol Elon sometimes makes Ponzi seem like a saint, the fanboys already lost a shit ton on crypto and now this, wat will he think of next
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:49:45'] Model Y was the best selling car in the world Q1.. I don’t think anyone is expecting anything but growth, given the slight price raises we’ve seen it’s clear that demand is not stagnatingAs for the share price, it’s overpriced at current levels. Longterm it’s cheap

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 21:35:04'] Good for them. Investing in hopes and dreams for the future is not investing. I will consider Tesla only when I will see at least 10years of consecutive and stable growth in the free cash flow
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 06:58:00'] Ehhh its about to be open season on teslas. If ratboy continues to be a hitler and the right continues its weimar reenactment, the blow back will hit a tipping point and tesla will be the official car of the nazi party.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nTesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this weeks earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.\n\nWith shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.\n\nLets see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.\n\n**Q1 Preview**\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Teslas Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nThe dip in Teslas YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35415978'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:53:47'] To me the stock price always rise high during the closest time to earning release due to hyped up, and result in little to no change or decrease after the earning release. If you’d like to buy it then get it a week before and sell it few hours before earning release.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 03:36:30'] Elon is getting hit on multiple legal fronts, with my limited knowledge I'd argue unless he detracts himself from Tesla, the overall market will not work in the companies favour especially with a lot of competition heating up the automative automotive market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:20:31'] Elon seems to be shifting some extra attention to the EV market while also isolating himself from the company a bit more. His trip to Shanghai and the latest storage facility being put out in china has also propped up their tech market with BABA seeing over ^22% the past month, still undervalued. Great analysis and I’d agree to hold, wait for a deal when a dip hits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 08:51:19'] not buying till its back to 100
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:14:07'] With the full self driving off the table not sure Tesla has the potential to become a $3 Trillion company. So why take the risk when the reward is not so much but the risk is high since if execution falters Tesla can fall 50% easily, like we witnessed few months ago.Competition is now picking up and competition has proven track record of making cars that are not only fancy looking but have great handling ability. Not sure I will buy a Model S when I can buy a Porsche Taycan for similar price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:37:13'] i've seen this movie before. Don't get emotional. See cold numbers. I'll buy TSLA ahead or Q1 earnings
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 07:11:04'] It’s difficult to divorce actual thinking from people smearing Elon so the cool kids will like them.  China has a lot to gain from others slandering Elon, and the fact remains that his companies are mostly doing incredible things.  TSLA is going to be down this quarter, and that’s going to have to be okay.  We aren’t sure what’s going on with the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:49:34'] Sold all my shares not too long ago. Doesn’t matter how much potential Tesla has, I can never buy/invest in the stock anymore because Elon is too volatile, you ever know what kind of shit he’s gonna pull next

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 05:10:56'] love how this 'dd' is focused on artificial growth. you yourself have even acknowledged in this post that the increase in sales is due to the price cuts. CUTS is an important term here, as tesla has already experienced the demand at their previous prices, meaning that if they ever return to them the demand will follow inversely.this is not a company growth stock, its a numbers growth stock. im not taking this scam into consideration for anything above $35.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 07:23:19'] Its already priced in.Besides, TSLA is still such an overpriced stock. It's just a meme-buy and will be probably forever.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 06:43:15'] I’ll never invest in any company owned by Elon. I don’t care how well it may do.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 07:02:07'] I don’t trust them, still down 6% from when I thought I bought at bottom. Not confident their market share will increase at all with all the new players that can produce similar performance for cheaper and so few will pay extra to have the Tesla name when they have been having quality issues and their leader is a mad man. I’ll be happy to break even at this point

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 07:26:19'] My view, staying away from Tesla until either 1) it hits $150 a share or 2) the FSD starts working properly. I own a Tesla with FSD, and while FSD is impressive at times, it's not prime time yet. It feels like they are soooo close to nailing it, but that's been the case for a year now... they just can't cross the finish line. But, they are close enough that it's almost unthinkable that they won't achieve it at some point in the near future (ie. a couple years max). At which point I think Tesla destroys all its competition, especially if they produce a $25k car.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:02:51'] Right, I'll get some puts

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:56:37'] The good:Tesla is still the leader in EVs. Tesla’s charging network is superior to all other options & will help increase sales once competitor EV owners realize how much of a pain using alternatives are (for full disclosure I own a Tesla & a Rivian & would only consider taking the Tesla on a longer trip).  Yes, opening up their network to others will help, but this is also another revenue stream for Tesla too. Tesla has building EVs at scale in a profitable manner down very well & have battery supply issues solved more than anyone. They have a lot of pricing flexibility.Their buying process is more appealing to anyone under 60.The bad:EV competition is heating up, with more options, people no longer have to buy a Tesla if they want an EV. The overall EV pie may continue to grow, but I see their piece shrinking.Musk’s association is a turn off to some potential buyersUnless the cyber truck has something spectacular that’s been kept under wraps, they’ve waited too long to enter the truck market segment with an odd design that lacks mass appealActual full self driving remains a pipe dream Their lead in tech in general is rapidly shrinking as they’ve basically not innovated much of anything for years. Lastly, yes, while I believe they will continue to do well as a car company, there’s no reason for the stock to ballon back to previous levels either as their is no ‘wow’ factor there anymore nor any on the horizon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 05:35:05'] I imagine Musk revealing himself to the entire world as an alt-right narcissist combined with tech layoffs and upper management layoffs all over the state have probably combined to significantly reduce the number of people interested in buying a Tesla.I think people that do not know a lot of liberals do not understand how toxic the brand is now among a huge group that used to be the main consumer target. And unfortunately for Musk and shareholders, there are a ton of viable alternatives now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:11:21'] Market share of the EV segment is a terrible metric to look at for Tesla. The EV segment is rapidly growing, and eventually all vehicles sold will be EV's. Even in the most absurdly bullish case possible Tesla was never going to maintain a 72.7% share of the EV market in California.The better metrics to look at are 1) how many vehicles are Tesla selling in California, and 2) what's their market share in the total California Auto Market?Think of it this way,  Apple was the first company to sell smartphones, so they once controlled 100% of that market segment. Does the fact that Apple now only controls a fraction of the global smartphone sales today because other companies jumped into the smartphone market mean that Apple was a terrible investment? No of course not, Apple is selling more smartphones then they ever were back when they controlled 100% of the smartphone market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 23:44:22'] Gunna take 3 more years worth of price cuts to get Tesla’s at a price that they are worth buying lol. Or just keep the high prices but fix the shitty QC

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 11:45:29'] IMHO I bet my money on reversal. In my analysis last months trend idicates that (used Nadaria Watson Envelop, RSI delta, and others)  Long term trend is showing oversold RSI. Price cuts might not have such a impact eventually, but it will trigger hype due to speculation. (just like it happened in my case)  Cybertruck is getting closer and closer and would eventually trigger up trend. Dont know this is just my opinion. Anyone agrees? Or do you all think its overvaluated and downtrend is going to happen?

Tesla energy is about it to hit boom time, FSD gets better every release, new factories, more giga presses, CT coming this year, semi, dojo, expanding charging network, growing insurance business, robot, etc. People need to get their heads out of their asses and do some research to see how exciting the future is for this company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 09:35:07'] The price cuts for the US market to make the eligible for tax credit will not help. Regardless of what everyone is saying, I strongly believe there is a demand issue and it might even accelerate in the near future. The economic downturn is not at all over. Even if inflation slows down, there is still inflation. This means more job cuts and less consumer spending. Just because YouTube influencers talk about new Tesla offerings, the cyber truck or magical margin improvements, does not mean demand will look better for the coming quarters. I assume at least three quarters of headwinds, given that evaluation is still high. Stepping back from all the hoopla for at least six months seems to be s good idea. Don’t hope for the next short term options play. Don’t gamble away your money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:01:20'] Bold of you to assume that Tesla will actually deliver the semi truck today
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 07:58:00'] Tesla's biggest problem has been not sales but production. If it builds enough electric semi truck production lines. I think this will really be reflected in its stock price
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:14:21'] Would think so. HAving done some sums, I don't think the truck is actually all that special. For example, Volvo's Class 8 EV truck the VNR, it its top form has a 565 kWh battery and a claimed 275 mi range. So it's about 2 kWh/mi or thereabouts. Tesla are claiming 500 mi? 2 kWh/mi?  So I think they're not really ahead in terms of efficiency or anything, but would seem to have a lead on packaging. For their claim they need about twice the battery and I guess a clean-sheet design would allow them to package that in better than the old guard.The real meat is whether they've made something that, in 500,000 miles, still works great. They're not known for building particularly high quality cars are they. That kind of performance will not wash in the heavy duty market. It just won't.As an aside, I didn't realise, but it seem Volvo have quite the range of applications for their EV trucks. They have a pretty wide offering!

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 21:22:27'] Cool news. No gripe against Tesla. Clearly the infrastructure for vehicles like this and the range are a concern. Outside of where the actual power is coming from, most of the concerns come about the battery technology. Lithium Ion was developed in the early 90s is shitty for these its why explosions and fire is a big concern. I am not patent expert with enforcement but the one who gets the batteries right is conceivably could be the "big oil" pick your name Exxon, Chevron, BP, Saudi Aramco of the battery space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:03:22'] To be clear, we just saw the post for the first 500 mi drive in this truck less than a month ago. I would be very surprised if these were anything other than limited production test vehicles, and Pepsi is probably getting them for free in exchange for test data under load.So I don't question that they were "delivered", but I definitely question if Pepsi paid money for them. And I doubt there's more than 10 of them; probably only 2 or 3.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:26:24'] While a cool idea in theory. I really struggle to see this being a thing. 1. teslas production sucks ass.2. The base that cares about EVs isn't truckers. Truckers like to fix their own trucks and (no offense to any out there) aren't the brightest. Stopping at McKinnelys on 95 for a GPS/Light are 9000% easier than trying to fuck with a Tesla. 3. I don't see how Tesla could keep up with Lithium. The price has tripled in a year. The Battery for these things would be HUGE it's almost impossible to imagine how much it would need to be running 18 wheelers all year non stop across the country. Imagine breaking down in bum fuck Alaska waiting for a battery at -15.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:12:22'] Two ways of looking at it:To preface, I think they’re an innovative company with good ideas. I like the company… but the market cap seems unreasonable.So,1. The stock is very overpriced and this information is irrelevant as it fails to justify the high market cap and and high multiples. The share value is based on both the actual growth and innovation as a company as well as “irrational exuberance” for future prospects that are difficult to justify. It often seems that the stock, itself, is more acting as a catch- all for electric vehicle investment.2. Regardless of the intrinsic value of the stock, positive news like this will cause positive investor sentiment. The price is already wildly high so it’s very possible that any bit of optimistic view will continue to push it up (at least, to a point.)Not knowing the future the company could be undervalued for all I know. I tend to think the high price isn’t justified, but again, we’re all just going off our best estimates. I tend to think that the price is unreasonable and unsustainable, but regardless of that news and sentiment can keep stock prices unreasonable for unreasonable periods of time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 10:49:31'] The semi isn’t really much of a factor into the stock price. It’s important but it’s a drop in the bucket. Autonomy is what would move the SP. Semi production would matter at that point but there’s still time. Not only does FSD need more polish, it then needs to get approval before it can get set loose. I don’t think it’s as far off as most would think but it’s also not within Elon’s timeframes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 16:15:11'] They're expected to deliver 15 semis today at the event, but if they pull an Oprah & point to various other semi reservation holders at the event & say, "You get a semi!" that will provoke some excitement for shareholders at home (these theoretical other folks would have already ponied up the funds, no surprised Pikachu face from them).We'll see. "What's in the back?" \[Robotaxi prototype rolls down a ramp\] "Wooooo!!!" We're off to the races. But realistically, much of what's expected to happen has already been priced into the TSLA share price. It's the unexpected that would move it. Given the higher battery materials cost, the prices are likely higher now. Also mostly priced in, but if it's significantly higher that might cause some downside concern.The big move to the upside or down, though, is probably the next FOMC rate decision on Dec. 14th.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:18:45'] Not a single member of government should have any comment on the stock market or business dealings until they stop trading on inside information and address the rampant illegal naked shorting that goes on in the ponzi scheme called the U.S. stock market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:35:36'] Warren is just another piece of shit grifter.  She couldn't care less about legal concerns unless they might cut into her personal profit margin.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 08:29:06'] A "conflict of interest" generally isn't illegal, but it's avoided because it can lead to doing illegal things. It's better to avoid putting yourself in a situation where there's  conflict of interest.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 15:55:07'] The only conflict of interest I see is he has a right wing following on Twitter, while EV, green energy is typically a left wing thing, or atlest more geared towards the left wing spectrum.I consider myself a moderate conservative and I've personally never met a conservative that are fond of EVs, they think Evs are weak, not manly and etc.The way I see it is Twitter is alienating the Tesla base, so yea, conflict of interest.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:46:43'] Of all the things he has done to manipulate markets, I don't think running these two companies is one of them.  But, when congress gets jealous of someone getting more attention than them; or, not getting those campaign contributing, then they act and/or whine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:50:07'] There are a million reasons to investigate Elon and his board of directors. Him being CEO of twitter and Tesla is not one of them.Also, responsibility to the shareholders is pretty loose, and not as strict a legal responsibility as some people make it out to be. Plenty of examples of CEOs operating against shareholder interest for perfectly valid reasons.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:52:09'] There is no conflict of interest. Tesla and Twitter aren't competitors.It's the same for Jeff Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post are not competitors.Don't take Warren serious, she's a liar and cynic.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:12:27'] I find it so funny, there a few people who got defensive (few weeks ago) and started telling that me “Tesla is the best car manufacturer” better than any legacy manufacturer “the have the highest profits” “and Tesla isn’t just a car manufacturer it’s actually a robotics company” and I was sort of agreeing with them, but I was emphasizing that Tesla is garbage company for a stock holder… They just kept on defending Elon, calling him a “genius”… they just couldn’t accept fact that Elon is a moron harming Tesla’s credibility both in its company valuation and its shareholders… Tesla hasn’t even hit bottom yet… I’m glad I went with Bill Gates investment strategy on getting puts on the downfall of Tesla… I wanna match it burn to the ground, literally the stupidest car they have manufactured is the Model X… ugly ass brid wing doors, u can’t even open that shit in your garage without causing any damage… that’s another people thing get defensive about… Tesla honestly is just too plain and simple in design compared to all the others car companies, majority of legacy automakers have already released EV’s or some sort of hybrid models… and they all look better than Tesla (in my opinion). I personally like the Jaguar I-PACE and Mustang Mach-E over the Tesla (brid car) Model X…Plus Tesla doesn’t even feel exclusive or luxurious anymore bc you’ll notice every mofo looking douchey as fuck in their Tesla… (I am Asian in the Chicago suburbs) and legit every brown motherfucker has that car here and they just look so full of themselves, I did a test drive at a dealership once in the model X and I just felt awkward and grossed out driving it… (I could just feel the douchynes vibes flowing off of me)… I’m glad in the end we opted out to get Audi Q4 E-Tron

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-31 10:13:47'] Why is everyone losing their shit over Tesla? Anyone could see the long term outlook. We knew once the big car makers started getting into the market. And we had to rely on Elon’s leadership, the stock was going lose a ton of it’s value, especially given how overvalued it was. Tesla won’t fail because of the first to market effect, but realistically it will probably go down to a about $78 dollars over the coming year. And then reach a price similar to Ford and GM in the next 10 years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 07:49:58'] Miss by a mile. Yesterday he said something in regards that even in recession Tesla is going strong. Seems like he has already started market manipulation and artificially inflating stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 07:58:37'] Continued rising defaults on auto loans, untamed inflation, rising unemployment, rising competition that provide cheaper EV options, China recession cutting into half of sales, U.S. recession cutting the other half, overleveraging Tesla stock to buy Twitter, and running out of headline making announcements to steer away from the facts. TLSA is on an express elevator to hell, going dowwwnnnnnnnn!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:37:38'] Could it be that he is talking about Starlink in Ukrain?!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:51:11'] Thinking he is talking about Twitter
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:06:00'] They will probably miss but I’m not so sure. With the rise in gas prices, you would think more people would buy EVs right? But then again, inflation is hurting the middle class so people might not be able to afford a new big purchase
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 17:27:29'] Remember, all beats or misses are estimates from analysts guessing. It's actually irrelevant to beat or miss estimates. What matters is if the company is doing well or better than before if a growth stock.So much is put in beating a pointless estimate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:52:26'] Earnings are UP (a.k.a. Profitability is UP). That means P/E will be lower (which is good).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:33:45'] Elon, welcome to the recession. It has been said that the more money you make and earn, the harder it becomes to maintain it. So, whether you fail, meet or exceed on Tesla earnings, you are still ahead in that you have a product that enables us to move further away from foreign oil manulipations and towards clean energy for the future. So, still a win, win. Kudos on keeping Starlink up. Peace out!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:36:40'] he talking to ye

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:52:25'] Here’s the thing, I hope it tanks. It helps with my strategy. But he could be setting underwhelming expectations so that if earnings are just slightly above expectations or just even, everyone will freak tf out

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla is down like crazy recently. Yesterday TSLA was down 11.41%, marked the 7th consecutive red days, its probably due to the production cut of Shanghai factory in December and January. \n\n[TSLA trading volume daily](https://preview.redd.it/9rz5vxhsem8a1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1abc55a97b6d8260e867f82dd28b2d31b6f404fd)\n\nSince the start of December, TSLA is down 45% with increased volumed after mid-December. The trading volume of Tuesday is remarkable considering the subpar trading volume of the main indices. And with that volume and that % change, TSLA is not seen any sign of slowing down in near term. \n\n[TSLA daily basis support](https://preview.redd.it/frbeodjuem8a1.png?width=1470&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2c4f614e935cffbaf7ecfaec2566830346a0cbd)\n\nThe next technical support level I found is around 91.52, which was tested and confirmed more than TWO years ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 04:38:39'] Their cars have always been classic early adopter products.  Early adopters tend to focus heavily on the performance (the battery) and not much else - and that’s where Tesla was/is great.  But…the EV market has moved toward an early majority market where customers care more about the “whole product,” such as interior finish, suspension, warranty, and all those small sums that make up the total ownership experience.   Tesla doesn’t compete well at all in that category.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:11:02'] Elon needs to be humbled a bit more & we're nowhere near the bottom imo. The competition is also heating up which doesn't bode well for Tesla. I have about 5 shares invested in Tesla and may need to eat that loss at some point. I do feel for those that are heavily invested in it as the damages done by Elon to the brand may be hard to recover from.

That is what I am doing.  This is not the bottom.  This is the middle.  Don't diddle in the middle.Her strategy is investors buy into ARKK because it is funded in these stocks and investors don't invest in ARKK for the cash positions.

Pre-market tends to be more volatile due to significantly lower volume as most investors only trade between standard trading hours.

InvestorsObserver's overall ranking system is a comprehensive evaluation and considers both technical and fundamental factors when evaluating a stock. The overall score is a great starting point for investors that are beginning to evaluate a stock. TSLA gets a average Short-Term Technical score of 60 from InvestorsObserver's proprietary ranking system. This means that the stock's trading pattern over the last month have been neutral. Tesla Inc currently has the 127th highest Short-Term Technical score in the Auto Manufacturers industry.

The problem with Teslanomics is eventually you run out of Other People's money.Edit- It's yet to be seen what Tesla will do once a Commercial Wholesale Battery is available to competitors in the marketplace. Lots of companies make way better, more solid vehicles than Tesla. It doesn't have to be a "better" battery.  It can be ...80% as good and 10 grand less and in a nicer build quality or whatever competitive attributes.  To really put a big dent in Tesla's market share of "battery powered" vehicles.And that will happen.  They didn't invent the wheel.

With inflation continuing to roll on, new taxes being imposed on Americans, electrical grid problems (California told EV drivers to drive less) and unemployment rising, paying a ridiculous amount for an electric vehicle will fade.  I don't believe the rebates will have that big effect on purchases.  Plus, there is the Elon Musk factor.  A bit of a loose cannon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 07:02:14'] TSLA is so unpredictable with Elon’s antics. I’m long for sure, and I like Elon a lot, but he’s making it a more risky investment than it’s been in years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-07 04:12:31'] Elon's antics make TSLA very unpredictable. I am definitely a long-term investor, and I adore Elon, but he is making it riskier than it has been in years.

Deflation is coming, Get ready.from: [https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/deflation-trading-strategy/](https://www.quantifiedstrategies.com/deflation-trading-strategy/)1. Generally, during deflation, asset prices go down, but there are a few assets that tend to perform well during deflationary periods, such as:**Real assets:** These include real estate, gold, and silver.**Treasury bonds:** Unlike corporate bonds, which are very risky investments during deflationary periods, investors consider Treasury bonds a safe-haven asset and tend to buy them.**Stocks of cash-rich companies:** Companies with huge cash reserves during deflation can make shrewd investments that can increase the value of their stocks.2.

Money supply is as key as anything else and yet we just agreed to shovel out as many dollars as humanly possible before the next debt limit bill runs out. Which by the way is the first time we have EVER not given the bill a quantity limit on the debt limit - we literally only gave it a date to expire before a new deal needs to be made (Jan 2025).We will continue to see domestic inflation and worldwide devaluation of the dollar before the end of that debt limit bill is over.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 12:06:30'] These stories are intended to make Elon look bad. I couldn't care less what he does in his personal life, TESLA is the only choice if you're buying into EV stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 09:33:42'] I think the entire purpose of the hit piece it to hurt Elon Musk and his investments. Since he expressed interest in buying twitter to restore free speech. He has been under attack. It also made him one of my favorite African Americans.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 13:13:47'] Elon is a clown either way.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 15:21:15'] Musk is a weasel.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 15:45:36'] He is like the male version of Amber Heard
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 17:10:14'] Elon works very long hour, he apparently only has time to skew around in the office (and his officemate), definitely no time to mess with women outside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 19:43:50'] Make cars, solar panels, rockets, tunnels etc etc.  and turn them into profit. As long as he does that, then I don't care where he puts his dick.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 21:20:58'] I refuse to give musk or any company he controls money because his impulse control is utter shit. I can’t be the only one and with every new attack, we are growing in numbers.  Not all that glitters is gold.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 15:35:21'] No, I dont think so. I believe that most people have realized that the news literally makes shit up. Their source was "someone familiar with the situation".   What were once prestigious news organizations are nothing more than tabloids.    If Elon did fuck her, it was probably with his friends wishes. Rich people get freaky

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 20:09:09'] The affair article won't nearly hurt Musk's stocks as much as the Twitter lawsuit scandal.Though yes, if he becomes a scandalous "2010 Lindsey Lohan" type, it could affect his image and his businesses. There's already a change in public perception happening, the average person doesn't see him as such a genius anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 20:15:45'] His persona has driven both his companies and, at times, parts of the market as a whole (crypto, twitter).  I don't see that changing now.  With all the negative PR, he really should be pulling back a bit on the "influencing" and shore up his businesses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 21:16:14'] Dude needs to keep his dick in his pants... but considering that Elon's dad fucked and got his own stepdaughter pregnant, I'm bound to think that that family is made up of the worst people
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 21:22:06'] The answer is obviously no, it won’t. This is just a small polemic that people will forget in the next 1-2 weeks. This isn’t something big enough to stall a stock. And tbh, the people who invest in TSLA are used to polemic and troll shit involving Elon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 21:54:51'] elon musk lying about cyber truck, semis, FSD, and now this stupid tesla bot didn't do much. so no. the musketeers really love the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 22:10:54'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 22:27:08'] well it changes a lot the semenomics of the company, so of course is going to affect tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 22:54:25'] There was an announcement on the financial channel about 2 months ago that Brin was getting a divorce Did not think  anything of it at the time
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 22:59:14'] This is so gross why should we care? As long as  his business ethics are on point, that’s what should matter. Why the attempt to smear Elon? He get dirt on someone and they didn’t like it? Sounds to me like he got dirt on someone and they didn’t like it. Yeahhhh no “celebrity drama” is just a distraction, you won’t be able to control us with this kind of thing much longer. I pity you…
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-26 00:00:56'] Musk has enemies who control fake news. Nothing new under the sun.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-26 07:57:03'] Elon needs to take ADHD meds or something. He gets too distracted with sht. Needs to focus on increasing share holder value. Get focused for f sake
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-26 09:11:06'] Don't understand hatred here for Elon, guess even Elon can't please everyone
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-27 07:29:13'] This kind of reporting is a reminder of why many traders/investors don't read the WSJ. The New York/WSJ culture, obsession with investigation, complaining, whining; it's a big turn off. Yes, we all know the New York based news media hates TSLA, Musk ever since the offer for TWTR.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 10:16:14'] I don’t know, but people attacking Elon because he wanted to buy Twitter to help with politic bias is pathetic. Especially on here with everyone riding his dick in the stock/crypto markets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 10:42:26'] wtf.... no is this a bot wtf?

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 14:48:51'] Elon is kind of unraveling himself
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 17:17:43'] Why should the news affect TSLA? If anything it should affect GOOG no?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 17:42:19'] I can’t stand Musk but I sort of believe him.  He’s such and asshole, he wouldn’t deny it, and in fact, he would likely brag about it if he did it and it came out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 18:07:25'] Who gives a shit? Other than karma farming, why is this article here? Why not some sub more appropriate for the subject matter like a tabloid section?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-25 18:17:49'] It's all BS ankle biting from Short Sellers losing their ass on the recent TSLA pop into the 800s. I would expect nothing less. Elons still the man, TSLA to the moon!! Team Elon, Lets Go!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:37:00'] Big tech dropped a lot in 2022 so no suprise they raise a lot now when recovering
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:50:45'] More likely shows how huge the top tech companies are, they are absolutely entrenched in everything we do and this will most probably increase in the future imo
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:20:18'] The world is becoming more tech dependent, so I wouldn’t be betting against tech giants.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:31:23'] You’ll get a rotation into value: crude won’t stay below 70 forever either. Keep in mind if the fed pauses or inflation continues to fall the dollar is going to fall in value. Stocks are priced in dollars obviously but that’s going to be a backdrop for a continued rally. But this time investors have options: you can get a 3-4% CD at a bank this time or even bonds with decent yields. There’s trillions sitting on the sidelines in money markets looking for appreciation better than single digit returns they are getting.If you’re a fund manager you won’t get fired for a bear market, but you will get fired for missing a bull market

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:05:36'] 14 years of QE after GFC allowed zombie companies to exist via easy access to capital. with rising interest rates, the existence of these companies are under threat, while cash rich companies like the tech giants are well insulated and are hence seen as "safe". this along with the AI theme helps explain why big tech is leading so much.That being said, we saw the market get hammered by tons of bad news a couple of months ago. everyone was on the bear wagon. those short positions are being obliterated right now, which helps explain this recent melt up in the market, and a drastic shift in sentiment.But fundamentally, has anything changed? not at all. people constantly make the fallacy of correlating the market with the economy. \*spoiler, they. are. not. the. same.\* druckenmiller figured out the housing bubble in 2004. market hit peak short interest in mid 2007. those shorts got squeezed out after the market continued to rally. sentiment shifted as the market topped, and the shit hit the fan in late 2008. is the recession coming? as sure as there'll be another rainy day. when will it be is anyone's guess. and if anything, if Ray Dalio is right,  people are likely underestimating the severity of the next big one.I'm a nobody and I know next to nothing, but those are my thoughts
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:04:43'] This chart has little to do with the odds of a recession.  The stock market is not the US economy.   In most cases, one pages the other by months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:32:47'] Why does it start in dec 2022 making it an 18 month graph?There is a classic how to lie with statistics fallacy that may be at play here.  If you can select arbitrary start points you can select the slope of perceived gains. It occurred to me because meta is in there and i bought the dip on meta.Meta had this huge covid income surge that swelled it's price followed by a "let's spend billions on vr that nobody wants" (dip) followed by a "thats dumb let's not do that" which resulted in gains. The percentage gain to now can be manipulated a lot by just moving a month or two.  When your list is down to 5 stocks, and one of them is already noted to have that issue, how you selected your start point matters allot to interpretation.Was it selected to maximize the percieved gains of those 5 stocks? If so that is a bias not predictive of future performance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 03:39:39'] Idk maybe some of those big tech companies shouod be broken up. Just a thought. Maybe that would help the other 493
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:31:31'] Interesting graph and I think it is even more impressive to consider the more than 100% YTD performance of NVDA, META, and TSLA — the first one due to generative AI tailwinds and the other two as bounce backs. If equally weighted the big tech performance will be even greater than the performance of the S&P 500. I think investors see big tech as all-weather stocks with enough cash for a recession and as the leading drivers of growth in our country. Some of the valuations are quite high like NVDA and AMZN, which could very well mean that the rest of the market is significant undervalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:12:27'] Economic recession has been here. Economic depression coming next. Those blue chip stocks price are being overpriced by Wall Street to dump on retail.

But what does META do now.  Does anybody actually use FB any more? It started off for kids.  Then adults , then old people . Now I don't know anyone who uses it. And if people don't use it they don't generate data to sell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:46:09'] They are all making money….. earnings have been good for all of them and they are able to operate at lower costs after they just dropped the bottom 10% performers out of their orgs. I’m bullish at this point, it seems we survived high inflation and can live at 4.5% or whatever it really is now. There was SO much money circulating before the rate hikes, its back in play and a lot of people got very wealthy from the pandemic. The rest of America that is struggling… low impact, the top is running to the endzone with the football now
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:50:25'] Equal weight sp500 ETF up 4.5% year-to-date, and coming out of a several month base, suggestive of some incoming sector rotation imo. 56% of s&p 500 companies are currently trading above their 200-day moving average. Nothing abnormal there to me.I think big tech has just been the easy play as markets position for a soft landing, and position themselves for AI. Consolidation becoming more likely.I personally think big tech is the trade of the next decade, so I expect to see a lot of charts like this.At the very least, I don't really see how you get from "some companies are doing great while others are doing a little bit worse than average" to "imminent crash".Also s&p 500 is up closer to 15% year-to-date not 11%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:37:26'] That's the point of a broad based index like the S&P, it captures all segments.  If tech drops, energy rises.  If energy falls, maybe financials takes it place.  If a company does so poorly that its a burden to the index then it gets dropped.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:11:34'] What is the reason for steep increase in tech company stocks? All of them laid off many workers and at least a couple of them are not doing well like meta and intel. Even though there is lot of talk about AI , none of the companies produced any new ground breaking products or services. So what gives?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:20:37'] Being in the S&P500 isn’t as prestigious for these 7 companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:07:10'] The thing I don’t like about this is that while most of the big companies have run up it doesn’t really show an accurate picture. This is implying that ALL 493 stocks have done nothing other than the big 7. But look under the hood more, Eli Lilly has run a bunch which means some companies have gone down a bunch. There are several of the 493 that are up 20%, there are plenty of companies that are down 20%+. So it’s just not a great way to look at it in my view. If the chart showed all financial sector together I bet that would show regional banks -50% or however much it would be for their collective shit performance

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:39:19'] My take on this is I have the biggest fucking grin on my face after going balls deep in tech at the start of the year. Going forward tech will be the main driver of GDP gains through increased operational efficiency, and I think we're seeing people allocate investments accordingly. Prices are likely to get ahead of themselves in the short term, but I still think tech is king long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:47:41'] As an AI language model, I cannot directly view or analyze specific graphs or real-time data. However, predicting whether a recession is imminent or not based solely on a single S&P 500 graph is challenging. The S&P 500 index is influenced by various economic factors, [market conditions, and investor sentiment](https://efimarkets.com/), making it difficult to make definitive predictions.    It's important to note that predicting economic cycles and market downturns is a complex task even for experts. Recessionary periods are influenced by a combination of factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, interest rates, geopolitical events, and consumer sentiment, among others.    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the economic outlook, it is advisable to analyze a wide range of indicators, conduct thorough research, and consider expert opinions. This can help provide a more informed perspective on the likelihood of a recession or potential market trends.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 05:09:37'] Graphs like this should have the y axis be log scale.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 06:56:10'] Recession is not coming anytime soon. Strong jobs and more importantly wages have increased for ALL people given them more money to support themselves. As a small business owner, there has never been a time when employees are making more money.

If 470,08€ are hurting more then just read into the functionalities of „Handel mit Derivaten & Arten von Derivaten“. You wanted to profit froma specific movement in a short timeframe. There are options for that. What you bought is a specific bet, that a specific stock falls under a specific price until a specific date which would have increased the inner value by the difference and other factors. This is a total loss although you may were right predicting the movement. Take your time and get to know what you buy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 06:07:08'] Lol, welcome to iv crush after earnings. Options cost more before earnings as people speculate the price could move. When they miss, or beat, the price could move, but now nobody is interested in speculating anymore. When playing earnings, you can't just be right, you have to be right and the move has to be unexpectedly large for the option to print. If enough people are on the put side of the bet (driving up the price of the contacts), but the price only goes down a percent or 2, you may not break even.

Either way, from a swing trading perpective the volatility remains high, which is resulting in continued opportunites on both the long & short side.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY:**  Index continues to 'lag' slightly behind the others.  Price traded generally within range from the previous 3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming just beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.  If it breaks out, next major resistance is a gap-window between 420 - 422.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-10 08:15:16'] Excuse? It's not an excuse. It's just the way it is. He's a Forced Seller now-or he's a Forced Seller later. When he loses the Twitter case -the market makers of Tesla stock will open Tesla price the next morning- down the market cap of his Twitter obligations. So it's either sell now-at a known price- or sell when everyone else knows he has to sell- which would be a lot lower price.That's what is happening here in this sale- he's taking the bird in the hand. October's bird will turd in his hand.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:53:14'] If we want to get away from fossil fuels, hydrogen seems like a no brainer over electric for more energy intensive applications (long distance travel, hauling heavy loads, aircraft, etc.) where the sheer weight vs. energy capacity of batteries is a limitation. I could see a future where electric is common for personal commuter vehicles while hydrogen powers larger vehicles. Would also be curious about the supply chain requirements for hydrogen. Does anyone know anything about the materials required to build hydrogen engines and compress hydrogen vs. electric batteries?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:42:39'] If flammability was an issue we wouldn't have gasoline engines.Tell us where all the hydrogen is going to come from.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:24:55'] The engine is irrelevant until you can create clean hydrogen more efficiently than you can create electricity, which sounds like a pipe dream. Hydrogen is only a "threat" to gasoline vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:24:27'] Can someone please explain to me what‘s so special about this engine? H2 combustion engines are nothing new at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 13:12:09'] Hydrogen is the answer, if it can be efficiently produced. Because Hydrogen has to be extracted it should be viewed as an energy storage device. The problem is, it's incredibly inefficient to produce. The round-trip energy loss (both in electrolysis and then converting hydrogen back into useful work) is just too large right now to be truly competitive with battery.In areas where there is significant renewables overload (like parts of California), it can be used as a storage mechanism. But unless we somehow find a large vein of raw hydrogen (somehow), the process of getting hydrogen out of water is too energy inefficient to be scalable.  As for infrastructure, I never argue the merits of new technology based on what was, but instead what can be. There's a huge difference between economic and scientific problems, and hydrogen's problem is scientific in nature.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:41:16'] I’ll change my mind about hydrogen when i can fill it up at home like BEVs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:20:35'] I was hoping this was years old but I guess not. The physics of hydrogen do not work for ice applications. It’s completely disproven from so many different angles. Such as 1. Hydrogen production 2. Distribution 3. Hydrogen embrittlement (longevity). 4. Boil off 5. Volume efficiency…..I don’t even think these are a compete list!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:10:03'] If Toyota continues these antics and fail to catchup other EVs, they will be the Nokia of this century.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:20:12'] Even when money is no object... I see no benefit to hydrogen. The reasons I want an EV more than any other reason is to 1- never go to a dirty gas station again (I live in LA they're ratty here)2- leave every morning with 350 miles range. No wake-up-earlier to full up with gas on the way to work. 3- silent ride, less mantainence, fewer moving parts. You lose all of this with H2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 07:22:07'] "The two most plentiful things in the universe are: hydrogen and stupidity." Harlan Ellison&#x200B;I'm a machinist currently making some isolation valves for a company that is putting them on the purge side of a hydrogen fuel cell.  They have done some testing in Europe and Canada with it.  The testing of the valve in their commercial buses has been on-going for a couple of years now since I made the first prototypes.  The company itself has a good way of extracting hydrocarbons from defunct oil wells and separating the molecules for fuel.  They have already started building some refueling infrastructure in some European countries.  But I have to agree that Hydrogen, in spite of it's incredible volatility, is a much better "green" alternative to EV's for the simple fact that the folks in Africa don't have to mine the minerals, for a pittance, that are needed for the batteries.  There's not so much damage being done to the earth to bring those minerals out and process them.  There's no waste involved when the battery dies and needs replacement, but the replacement battery costs more than just buying a new car (I believe we're already headed in that direction).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:42:16'] The real killer to gasoline motors will be the platform that can offer the quantity of “gas stations” plus the time to refuel. Going full EV, it just makes sense to get a Tesla. You can charge anywhere and you get the Tesla network but you have to wait at the station for a bit if your low. (If your at home this is irrelevant since technically means a full tank EOD).Going H2, there refueling is quicker but there’s literally just a handful of stations.. At the end of the day gasoline motors I personally feel will win out with the new fuel being produced from Porsche & Toyota - Exxon collaboration.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:31:33'] This is the 1980's all over again but this time, it's Toyota that is starting the misdirection.If you've watched, "Who killed the Electric Car?" then you know what I am referring to.  If you haven't, please go watch it asap, it's a classic.Bottom line: The cost to setup the infrastructure for H far outweighs the benefits and has no short term feasibility. This tech will take another 50 years to get right for public/consumer use.EV's are the best short term tech solutions until Hydrogen can grow into something feasible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:41:08'] He is right... as scotty kilmer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:47:45'] The issue with hydrogen combustion has always been:1)  Hydrogen combustion engines release significant amounts of nitrogen oxides, which from an environmental standpoint are far worse than carbon dioxide. If the goal of new vehicles is to reduce environmental impact then this is going in the complete opposite direction.2) To work at scale you’d need trillions of dollars in infrastructure. EVs circumvent this because they can be charged from home. Good luck getting people to adopt hydrogen cars if there’s not at least a few refuelling stations in every single city, town, and highway truck stop.3) Your car literally becomes a bomb. While people can survive accidental EV fires, an inevitable hydrogen explosion would be horrific.Edit: lol at downvotes that don’t give a rebuttal. This thread should be a great reminder for people to do their own DD instead of blindly believing that a promotional video by Toyota will be the future

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:23:15'] For most vehicles electric battery EVs make more sense. Much easier to send electrons to stations than having to have thousands of semis to take hydrogen to the non existent stations which cost more to build and maintain.  Hydrogen may be an option for large boats and airplanes, maybe some very long distance heavy trucks but that's it. Majority of vehicles are personal and electricity is pushed though the existing electric grid which is always being upgraded with more renewable forms
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:28:26'] “No more EV’s” — that’s a bold claim. Countries and automakers have already pivoted. The boat is turning and it won’t stop unless there’s a severe raw material shortage. Like someone already pointed out, this would be a better application for power sense requirements.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:43:41'] It's interesting but with most of the world's advanced economies going all in on EV, I would really really doubt H2 combustion cars will destroy the EV markets.I think their only shot is if they can produce H2 vehicles that are the same price as ICE vehicles because EV is still stupid expensive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:46:58'] This will not impact the EV market at all in the short to medium term and likely never. Toyota has been pushing hydrogen powered cars for decades, but without massive investments from industry and governments this tech is DOA as there is literally no where to refuel. Think how long it's taken implementation of EV charging and in America we're still behind.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:48:46'] The greatest thing about my EV is that I can easily fuel it at home or just about anywhere. I can't see giving that up. I already have enough range for all but road trips and any more power would go from fun to dangerous.  Hydrogen seems like a step backwards.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 09:50:50'] I'm willing to stake my entire portfolio on H2-EV Hybrid being the end game of personal transportation. There are significant challenges when it comes to infrastructural H2 (being the smallest atom leaks are common). Battery tech is taking some good steps right now to move away from nickel, manganese, and cobalt meaning that, not only are the human rights concerns going to be alleviated, but also the cost and recyclable nature will drastically increase. Acting like electricity won't be a part of transportation is simply naive.At the same time we can utilize extra energy from grid production specifically to not only provide desalination at coastal regions but also to perform electrolysis to make H2. Not only for energy storage but also potentially municipal supply. Acting like H2 won't inundate almost every industry that involves heat or motion would also be naive. The redundancy that comes from utilizing both systems, and both systems being generated from renewable resources, is something that can't be overlooked. You're on a region with no H2? Just plug in. No charging around you? Fill up with municipal H2.I personally foresee house heating, cooking, transportation, and even long term energy storage being based on H2 and battery tech, all off the back of booming solar production. Even just looking at my situation directly, I spend about $300/mo on gas... looking at an EV and the cost would be about $40/mo in electricity. They are simply better. If I could hybridized that with H2 and get that redundancy and peace of mind I absolutely would.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 11:14:37'] Pressurized H2 turns every car into a bomb. Rupture a tank and everyone is dead.  Period. Battery fires are bad enough. Hydrogen is a whole other level.Hydrogen fuel distribution is even a whole other nightmare too. Look at how much of a pain electric car chargers have been. That is with long-range distribution (power grid) already done for us. Hydrogen will have to be transported like gasoline because it’s a physical thing, except it happens to be one of the most difficult things to transport. It leaks through everything. Hydrogen embrittlement is a thing. It’s an outrageously difficult material to handle.Toyota is out of their minds on this and have not thought this through. Ignorant management is trying to differentiate themselves and has delusions of how influential Toyota is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 11:18:50'] My problem with hydrogen right now is it seems to be a more mechanically complex technology. It seems that electric is "simpler" and has less parts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 13:08:35'] This video almost gave me cancer. It's biased and utterly promotional and fails to explain the main drawbacks that still prevent this from being viable:1. As abundant as hydrogen is in the universe, it does not exist in pure form on Earth, which means it must first be separated out. Separating it always takes more energy than you will get back from the resultant fuel. So this means you will have to cover the cost of the energy used to create it. That's before you account for any of the energy used for compression and storage.2. Once you've got hydrogen you are better off using it in a fuel cell as this provides the best conversion to useful energy and ultimately work. But even this process can lose substantial amounts of energy (way more than a battery). A combustion engine with hydrogen is a stupid idea as it would reduce the well to wheel efficiency tremendously.3. The cost of all these components and new infrastructure for refueling is way way higher than an equivalent electric-only fleet.4. H2 cars have their own unique rare material requirements, especially for components in the fuel cell catalyst making them extremely expensive.Seriously this is some absolute dumb shit. They are designing to alleviate a single thing about electric cars (slightly slow charge times). But in the process they are creating a system that is way worse in every single way.Who wants to pay more per mile in extra fuel costs?Who wants to be beholden to the price of hydrogen at a pump instead of generating your own electricity at home with solar?Who wants to pay an excessive amount for H2 cars that are significantly more expensive and don't offer significantly more range?Who wants to have a car that retains the hundreds and hundreds of moving parts and maintenance requirements instead of going electric and saving on all that?Who wants to have a noisy car?Who wants to have a car that's less performant then an electric equivalent?If that who is you then you're either in the gas/oil/car-dealership industry or an idiot.

Just inceease the size of the battery to have a range of like 30 miles. Locate hydrogen stations on highways outside of cities. Fewer logistics in making important stations. You don't need as many stations as cars fuel way quicker than EVs. People still charge at home for their local trips. Hydrogen way more effeciency in long distances. Both hydrogen and EVs use electric motors. This one in the article seems different but the current hydrogen cars are mostly not using a combustion engine. Probably very much not understanding how both systems work but just my thought.

Batteries don't recycle or last the way people would like so EV so far seems unsustainable but retroconverting cars tonuse H seems to show promise (on the optimistic assumption that the manufacturers press releases are honest)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 14:52:49'] We'll have to see how Hydrogen infrastructure works out. It seems great for larger engines like cargo freighters and cruise ships.Right now EV are coming on strong and have the benefits of using existing infrastructure and greatly reduced vehicle maintenance requirements. Electric motors have a huge benefit over an engine that uses exploding gases and many parts that require constant lubrication. Amprius Technologies has started producing - meaning selling - lightweight silicone lithium batteries that have a faster charge ability and hold more than the normal batteries available in current EV. These batteries address range anxiety and charging time, meaning these have a lot higher density, and charge from 0-80% in 6 minutes. These new batteries are being used in high performance aircraft and drones. Once these type of batteries become more readily available EV ranges will increase by almost double. And you'll be able to recharge in a similar time it now takes to fill up your ICE vehicle I'm excited about hydrogen and see the innovations as proof that corporate stagnation has started to diminish. We have to try a lot of stuff in order to get away from our dependence on burning fossil fuels. And for those who say electricity comes from fossil fuels at generating plants: it's a lot easier to condition the outflow from one smokestack than thousands of tailpipes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 15:12:38'] I just think as battery tech continues to evolve, we will go electric. Way, way less moving parts so manufacture and repair are less costly. Energy from the sun charging cars in garages will handle 90+% of our needs. You don't have to harvest, chill and transport it. For long haul trucks I have always wondered why they didn't do it like a train locomotive. Diesel generator powering an electric motor. Instant torque for heavy loads. Electric has to become the norm there eventually. My opinion is we keep on the path to solar and get the residential consumer off the power grid first.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 15:18:00'] Always wondered about the possibility of sucking air or hydrogen straight from air and using that. Don’t have that technology yet I suppose but does anyone see any issues with that if the technology comes in?

You think EV charger infrastructure is bad? HA. How many hydrogen pumps out there? That's four. Let's keep going. 2-3x more electricity needed for hydrogen. Think the grid can't handle EVs? Good thing we won't all be in hydrogen cars. We'd need 2-3x more electricity compared to EV cars to support it. Cost of hydrogen is as much if not more than gas. More parts means more things go wrong, means more labor, means less scale. Toyota is diffing their own grave with this shit. So sad to see a company completely destroy themselves. They will likely be bankrupt by the end of the decade. And what happens when EV charging time drops 50-70% by the time this comes out? No on will give two shits. Could be very useful for some transportation, but 80% of semi trucks don't need the extra range/speed. It's a limited use case type of thing. TSLA will laugh at this shit. You can't fill up a hydrogen car at home. And it will be 3x the price. And who is building the infrastructure? Think we are going to spend billions on EV chargers and then also build out hydrogen?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 16:04:49'] Hydrogen combustion is exactly 5 TIMES less efficient than an EV in terms of translating energy to movement. Not only that, but transportation, storage and combustion of hydrogen all require complex machines and infrastructure that will also be unreliable. There is no overcoming that kind of handicap; it will always be dramatically more expensive. As EV cars are already great with today's technology, there is absolutely 0 room or need for hydrogen cars. Even Toyota is beginning to accept this now. With a few more years of battery improvements, even the range and refuel time advantage will disappear completely. Additionally, battery tech is already encroaching on domestic aviation and smaller boats, with companies showing feasible products today.With today's technology, hydrogen is only useful and appropriate to develop for 1) steel production (very high temp industrial) 2) cargo shipping and 3) international aviation. The fossil fuel lobby is quickly coalescing around hydrogen, and they'd very much like to develop a hydrogen based economy where consumers are footing the bill for their unreliable and inefficient technology while they reap constant revenue. Electric is not only better for the environment, it's better for our ongoing class war.

But I feel like it doesn't matter how well combustion of various fuels comes along, someone is going to find a reason to say no.However, from a realistic standpoint H2 engines will have a place. Whether it's combustion or fuel cells. Batteries just cannot do the heavy duty stuff (except in very niche applications). In their research JCB reckoned only their bobcat/mini digger was suitable for BEV. For everything else the power demands, duty cycles and running times meant batteries weren't going to cut it. They'd severely increase the cost, the weight. Would never be rechargeable in the times allowed and the intense duty cycle would wear the battery out beyond being useful in 18 months. But for light duty application? I can't see anything but battery now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 01:08:48'] This has been disproved time and time again. The wastage from energy production to turning your tires is just too high for hydrogen, whichever way you cut it compared to straight electricity.Hydrogen:* electricity source* electrolysis to produce hydrogen efficiency * compression efficiency * transport of gas energy use* car cell conversion of hydrogen to electricity efficiency* motor efficiency EV:* electricity source* grid* battery efficiency* motor efficiency I’m trying to remember off the top of my head here, but roughly the hydrogen efficiency is about 30-40% where as EV is around 60-70% from source to tires.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 04:29:41'] Electric car makers are already dead, they just don't know it.  Electric bicycles have won. 3 grand and happy. For the big stuff hydrogen is going to win - attach electrolysis to every windmill and collect the stuff like dairy trucks to dairy farms.  Easy peasy. Get the 18 wheelers done first with fill ups on the big express ways.  They are so pissed with diesel prices they will be begging to own one.  Locomotives, ships and farm machinery are all natural fits as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 04:37:48'] Owned a Mirai for three years. Fills up like a gas car, 0 emissions, and H2 can be made from renewable energy. Only problem is that they are not enough fuel stations (amywhere). It is also harder to build a hydrogen tank for a gas station than it is to install an ev charger. The infrastructure to support the vehicle type will be the bottleneck in the transition one way or the other.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:18:06'] Hydrogen is a joke. EV is the only sensible future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:18:17'] H2 won’t go anywhere for EV cars. He will be replaced or Toyota will go under
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:22:18'] Isn't this old news though? I thought the biggest issue with these cars were:1: Safety, they require a perfect seal and high pressure when re-fueling.2: Cost, currently it costs more than both Petrol and Diesel.3: Severe lack of hydrogen refill stations, I think the UK has 15?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:38:43'] Looks like hype wrapped in bullshit.   Yes, there may be some future for hydrogen, especially given that it can be a combustion fuel or fuel cell but it's not gonna displace conventional EVs any time soon.    Wired Magazine had a great article about the imminent surge in hydrogen based transportation.   It was a great read in 1998    25 years later all that's changed is a new group of enthusiastic nerds, too young to know how long we've been on the cusp of disruption.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:40:37'] Actually, no... the video claims the engine can run for 300 miles with 5 Kg of H2, which is incorrect. Jason Fenske, from Engineering Explained, demonstrates ([in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJjKwSF9gT8)) that you actually need 16 Kg of H2, or the equivalent of 400 L in liquid form, which is about 14.1 cu ft, and that's not even counting the pressure vessels. This is simply not viable for a mid-sized car. A pure BEV is a lot more efficient, at 300 L of storage space required, and improving with battery cell and cell-to-pack technology.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:41:39'] I think it’s a race between technologies like this and more advance battery technology like fluoride ion cells for example. Who ever get there first will be the leader however. I do believe personal vehicles will be electric in the future and larger trucks and off road equipment will be using some form of hydrogen fuel cell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:44:47'] Over the years, the public has seen so many hydrogen fueled rockets blow up that I thick it'll be a hard sell.  But, being the most abundant element in the universe, it definitely has that going for it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:59:14'] A lot of what I’m hearing here are the same arguments heard with EVs. A lot of “it can do this”, “no, it can’t do that”, or “the alternative can’t do it”. It’s literally the same argument we had with ICE vs. EV. A lot of promise at this point, not so much in the delivery department. They all require people to get on board, and that’s the reason this thread/video exists. It’s to get people on board so people make money. It doesn’t have to work well, it just has to work well enough.I can’t wait to get the “no, it isn’t, I’m in the field” responses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 06:02:35'] Last I heard, the fuel tank for a hydrogen vehicle had to he so heavy that it made the whole thing undoable.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 06:20:44'] Is this 25 years from the past? Where is that Toyota Mira that was in concept 25 years ago?

H2 cars on the road is like mini atomic bombs waiting for an accident if storage leaks.Toyota is getting very desperate, they running out of ideas to copy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 06:26:29'] Let me guess it's too expensive and inefficient to mass produce atm, big oil will hold it back with lobbying, and research on it will die down and the technology will get nowhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 06:26:39'] Very interesting and informative thread, with lots of well-informed posters. But it's too easy to get sucked into a search for some magic bullet that will solve all our problems in one fell swoop. My sense of the problem (how not to destroy the biosphere with rampant carbon emissions) is that it will require an integrated approach. Hydrogen will play a part, EVs will play a part, same with nuclear power, renewables, mass transit, increases in efficiency, changes to agriculture and diet, social engineering, and even just plain old more walking. Each technology will have certain specific niche applications where it's the best solution.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 10:14:11'] This is a classic “sounds good, doesn’t work” scenario. Too much complication in the supply chain aspect plus takes up too much vehicle space while electric is more scalable and adds benefits to cars like more passenger and cargo room.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 11:30:19'] I applaud Toyota for its forward thinking under it’s new CEO. I watched the video and aside from the benefits of a hydrogen combustion vehicle. I think this will be a pipe dream unless Toyota does what Tesla did and is currently still doing. In reality, hydrogen combustion engines may never be a viable option UNLESS Toyota builds out the infrastructure necessary to fuel these vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 12:47:30'] GM came to the same conclusion years ago. They just didn’t have the nerve to follow through once Tesla became the gods of auto.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:39:50'] It would seem to me that a better way to go would be to use hydrogen to generate electricity at a power plant and charge cars/small transportation on that generated power. I am no expert on hydrogen systems but I would expect that the hurdles of vehicle/onboard hydrogen storage and infrastructure development would be simplified using this model. Would this not be a green and efficient way to power cars? I think that 1 power plant to power many cars would be much more efficient than each vehicle having its own small power plant
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:22:43'] looool, internal combustion engines efficiency is low as crap..  Hidrogen producing efficiency is crap, though hidrogen-ellectric are a decent solution to not having to wait to recharge, though there are a lot of challenges to storing hidrogen.  So, yeah, EVs industry is safe
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 15:21:36'] Why not have both???
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 16:46:12'] Hydrogen powered vehicles is entirely possible. And no matter what the propulsion source is, there's always a danger. But as history proves, dangers can be mitigated. And hydrogen is no exception.But hydrogen powered vehicles have a real problem that will not go away easily, if at all. Hydrogen has to be synthesized in a manner that makes economic sense. If not, people won't be able to afford the cars - kind of like EVs right now.I'm a fan. Let's see where this goes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:10:06'] But there is close to none H2 pump facilities..  unless we are talking about hydrogen fuel cells that is cheap as hell and takes 5mins to charge
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 19:13:28'] Interesting conversation. Adding my thoughts. I believe that EVs will be the long term solution with Solar or renewables charging the batteries and the fuel stations of today will be modified to just switch the batteries on a car. Remove the empty charge with a battery that’s fully charged using renewables. This will take less time that charging the empty battery. I also believe this to be applicable for trucks and heavy vehicles as well. Planes will be using sustainable fuels which have been demonstrated successfully already. I don’t see a future for hydrogen due to several good points raised by many people here, mainly due to low energy density, transportation issues via ammonia and the costs involved, etc. Anything with low energy density can not be a suitable candidate for fuel. Hydrogen being such a small molecule there will be leaks and accidents which will scare people away just like many are with Nuclear power. So it may die not just due to technological barriers but perception and poor reception among people as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 05:01:15'] ???? Its got to be much much easier to make ethanol than H2 - then we barely have to change the engines we have now.Should it prove too hard to make all the batteries we need and we still need some fossil like fuels in the mix we can use ethanol or other biofuel.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 15:51:30'] For EVs to continue rising, they need to solve the stopping for half an hour to an hour. It simply isn't convenient... Those with EVs will say it's not a problem, but we all know its a hassle they could do without 🤷‍♂️Solution is a) obvious one, batteries that will do 500/600  miles, with constant usage of lights, heater, window wipers, heated seats, etc... included in that figure. b) Infrastructure - if you do need to charge up, ensure there's plenty of chargers to go round. Currently, the lack of infrastructure leads people back to ICE vehicles......c) EV manufacturers agree to have the same battery connections and  make EV battery stations, where you or a station worker (new jobs in communities too) will swap out the battery for a fully charged one in 5 minutes. It's feasible. Fuel stations are already built , so they'd only need to adapt for this service, Technologies are already there that changes the batteries in Fork lift trucks, reach trucks, and hi level order pickers. It could easily be adapted to EVs on the road, they could even automate it to reduce human error.This would give the EV industry another 20 years, and in that time, hydrogen is ready to be mass transported and cost effective to put into vehicles. Having typed all this, I feel its wasted in this forum 🙈
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 06:33:00'] Using hydrogen for combustion engines doesn't get you away from required oil changes and other required maintenance. H2 fuel cell EVs with electric motors would use the energy more efficiently than a combustion engine and requires a lot less maintenance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 11:18:26'] Just a side comment. I recently wrote a paper on EVs and what a lie it is. For starters, there's a finite amount of known lithium sources. If any new mines develop, it takes around 15 years to get to the usable lithium. Everyone (govt, car CEOs, etc.) knows that there isn't enough lithium to make the EVs needed to reach net zero by 2050. A ton of other electronics need lithium batteries too. The idea fails again because people that bought EVs early and mid trend will need a new battery for their vehicle or buy a new EV...so again, not nearly enough lithium to supply that. Then we'd spend a bunch of money making the grids able to handle the new electricity that's needed only to run out of lithium a few years down the road and have EVs that would then be paperweights. It doesn't take much digging at all to find that everyone pushing this EV idea is invested in it. So they'll be set for life $$$, even after the movement fails. It's a giant money grab and all it really is, is selling a feeling like you're saving the environment, when in fact it's a drop in the ocean. ICE pollution makes up like 20% of air pollution...that's ALL the trains, boats, planes, 18 wheelers, passenger vehicles, motorcycles, etc. Passenger vehicles are something like 60% of that...so replacing every passenger vehicle in the world with an electric version would make about a 10% change, worldwide...so it's not the earth saving concept they'd have you believe it is. I'm not saying let's just give up on the planet. We do need to develop clean energy. We need to let it grow naturally though. The ICE didn't get this advanced over a few years...it's taken over 100 years to get here. We definitely should not put all our eggs in one basket with the EV movement. It's just another way the elite will screw the American people out of their hard earned money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:57:15'] Do your own research. This is Not financial advice. As someone who works in finance, I learned it's great to get your first $100K-200K in some broad blended stock index fund before being cute and silly with individual stock picks. VOO tracks the S&P 500 so it's great core holding that fits the above mold. Your other stocks are the top holdings within the S&P 500 so all you're doing is concentrating or tilting more towards the current best companies that everyone agrees are the best in this current day and age. Sentiment, fundamentals, and management teams change shifts over time for companies so it's not guaranteed the top companies will stay the top companies.For that reason, investing in something that changes with the times makes rational sense. Index funds periodically rebalance to add winners and losers without you needing to analyze individual companies. That said, my single stock pick gamble at the moment is 140 shares of GOOGL and that comprises 5% of my total portfolio. I like to gamble with maximum of 5% at any given time. The rest of my stock exposure comes primarily from S&P 500 (FXAIX), Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), total international stock index (VXUS).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:57:40'] Diversify from big tech.Take about 10% of your holdings and put it into something smaller cap and riskier. The companies you’re invested in are all mega cap, the biggest of market caps. They are all over a trillion in market cap so you will not see huge gains over a long period of time. Going from 10 billion market cap to one trillion is 10,000% return. Going from 1 trillion to 2 trillion is a 100% return. The higher a companies market cap the less amount of total return you can expect to see going into the future. So your investments are very safe but you are already invested in well established companies that already had their big runs.

Do that after a steep downturn in mstr (probably tomorrow) Sell fewer otm covered calls to offset theta decay AFTER letting mstr swing back up and your portfolio shows gains (10%ish gain). Mstr basically equals btc. Try to get as many year+ otm naked long calls as possible within next 6 months. Mstr probably will be breaking 300 again within next few weeks, if not months. Revisiting ATH is what we're after with next 2 years, that's over 300% roi on the stock alone. Sure you could buy the stock,  but why not go big? I pulled out a loan to do this 6 months ago. Already paid back the loan and I'm up 300% already.Play the theta decay game and you'll go positive during stagnant times. Portfolio will look like a Rollercoaster without having covered calls, BUT each covered call limits your upside potential while softening drops.(After selling covered calls, keep cash as dry powder to buy more otm call options after price drops)

Assuming as he continues to sell the remaining 63% the stock will drop at least as much as the first week meaning I would hypothetically get a 55% increase. \n\nThen sell out of the short 3x position as he gets close to having sold all of the shares which he needs to sell. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 16:42:48'] It’s reasonable to not buy Tesla shares if you think they’re overpriced, but shorting Tesla is financial suicide. Someone posts a meme and suddenly you’re out $70k or something. It doesn’t follow any logic or rules.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 16:41:40'] I don't think Tesla is done going down but I don't think playing that opinion is worth it...it can be an erratic stock.If he continues to sell in the way he has, the dip buyers and call buyers are probably not going to be able to override the selling until he's finished...there was apparently call buying on Tesla on Friday and it was still your worst NDX stock of the day, but I'm not going to try to predict the movement by it.If you want to take the risk, feel free to, but I'd rather watch from afar.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 20:04:42'] Dude, this is a terrible conclusion to draw. I get it, but you're trying to draw a linear relationship where one doesn't exist.When insiders sell large amounts of shares, they use a process called VWAP. The broker will just sell small amounts of shares throughout the day so that it moves the price as minimally as possible. That's why it'll take him 2 weeks to sell, because the amount of shares to be sold is much higher than the average daily volume.As a result, Musk's sales have probably had a minimal effect on TSLA price. What has affected the price is everyone else selling BECAUSE he's selling. And now the fact that he's selling is no longer news. So TSLA might drop more, but unless more negative news comes out, the drop might not be sharp. It could also rebound and kill you if you short. So be very careful shorting anything.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-15 06:09:28'] The price wiill likely stay around $1000 until Elon is done. Then when Jan 2nd comes and they announce 10-20% more cars delivered in Q4 than Q3 with the same or better margins than Q3 the price will climb back up until earnings and possibly even surpass the previous high. Q4 deliveries are usually the best of the year. Tesla will continue breaking records every quarter and will have 2 huge factories ramping up next year. Q1 and Q2 margins will suffer a bit but Tesla learned a lot from their China factory. By the end of next year we could see Tesla at $2000+. Dojo will be completed and will start training the NN next year as well which should increase the rate of improvement for FSD significantly. I'm guessing take rate for FSD could go up significantly by Q4 next year increasing margins further along with all of the recent price hikes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 08:11:52'] A lot of this is contingent on their delivery numbers and then their earnings afterwards. I’m not too optimistic on their upcoming deliveries tbh

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:49:45'] Don’t sell unless you don’t believe in holding the stock anymore. If I were you I wouldn’t sell and would just start investing into VOO from now on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:34:52'] Don’t sell. Just more $ into VOO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 04:43:33'] You don't sell you sit and start a new investment from fresh cash... Buy for long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:47:26'] RIVN
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:16:40'] Tezhla
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 22:25:15'] Out of all of them, VOO is the best for a safe long term investment. BRK.B is a great value stock and Apple may good too, but it’s hard to tell what companies will continue growing in value and for how long; that’s why a solid index fund like comprised of many companies such as VOO is a good long term play.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:26:12'] Well just consider AAPL, BRK, TSLA and AMZN are a big percentage of VOO (15%?). The other stocks you have are trash… would dump those first.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:45:17'] Sell rivian and keep the rest they're good companies
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 21:59:09'] Sell INTC, and buy more VUG why buy Sp500. It’s slower.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:51:12'] if I'm reading this right, then you have a low volume of all of them, so you have to look at your profit margin for each as well as do some research and reading of charts. one you work out who is peaking and who will still do well for you, a more educated decision can be made. best of luck

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:44:23'] I think RIVN is gonna do very well over time, or…..they’ll go bankrupt. Since you’re looking to buy VOO, I’m assuming you’re threshold for risk is low. So, that one?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 03:26:44'] This isn’t financial advice at all and I don’t even trade much anymore nor do I know much. I’ve been bullish on Tesla for 5 years though and would actually like to know what you believe is the optimal option. Stock trading is intuition sometimes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 04:04:46'] Which application is this?And is it good for investing?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 08:43:27'] When you bought these stocks normally, you should have done an analisys. If something negativelly changed since then sell that stock. If not I don’t seen any reason why you should sell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 17:38:55'] Options is the way to grow the account.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 01:18:56'] You can get rid of all of them, most of them are in VOO too, just with way less risk.. if you have an individual stock and the CEO of that company does something stupid and the company goes bankrupt, you lose all your money.. if you have VOO and that happens, is not a big deal, you have 499 more companies still keeping up your investment..
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 04:54:54'] I love Rivian trucks and SUVs. They are gorgeous and I see more and more on the road every day, but the stock is hot garbage on a July afternoon in Missouri.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 10:58:16'] definitely RIVN can go.  Also, put some rules in place so you don't hold onto a loser like this in the future.  If it starts living below the 50 day simple moving average it's time to hit the sell button.  That way you live to buy another ticker.  You have to be brutal and think of every holding like a temporary employee, if it's not performing it's got to go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 16:13:34'] Thanks for the advice, I'll hold onto my stocks like they're my children...except for GameStop, that one's outta here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 18:43:44'] Dont sell intel. Intel is probably going to out compete amd and nvidia in cpus and gpus.  Dont listen to stock people about tech.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:38:13'] For the Monthly chart the MACD is about to cross in RIVN and crossed in VUG. Besides BRK.B they are all solid.  These stocks will print but know you’re price target cuz only you can hit the sell button.

I get the feeling that there isn't going to be as much call buying tomorrow, which is what typically jams TSLA up, so I will be surprised if TSLA finishes higher tomorrow.Elon isn't selling his shares tomorrow (that's not how this works), but short-term sentiment matters here, so the options casino games may be muted.Edit: Didn’t realize this was for Friday (thought it was for Monday). So, maybe even lower than what I said.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:47:48'] Best advice I could give you is to not beat yourself up too much. Everyone gets carried away with the market at some point.If I was you, and I wasn't trading on borrowed money, I would take the hit on the chin and accept that you fucked up but it cant really get much worse than it is at present. Hell, some of the stocks are at levels that could be pretty good buy points. But some also aren't. I would just stop looking at them for a couple of months.Use the break to invest in yourself. Learn some basic TA, which can help you to not step on so many landmines. Look at a simple Bollinger band. 20 period. If the monthly close price isn't above the center line and the line isn't trending up then the stock isn't something you should be investing in. Simple momentum. There's plenty of other TA if you want to get a bit trickier. Just remember to KISS. And don't take advice on individual stocks from anyone. How do you know they aren't looking to unload their stocks onto you....  Best of luck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 02:33:10'] Your portfolio is still much better than my crypto portfolio
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:25:49'] Trading stocks is a skill you’ll need to invest time and money into. That means learning to read financial statements and learning basic macroeconomics principles at the bear minimum.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 13:24:21'] Op, a lot of the haters seem to have extremely short memories. Before the pandemic, a number of these stocks were great medium to long term performers while Tesla’s balance sheet issues were sufficient enough to cause people to cast doubt on its future as a public company. You have 2 major issues. One is understanding why you own certain names. For example, relative to 2020-21 when nearly everyone was wfh, will there be more usage of zoom’s core product in 2023? How can online dating grow on top of pandemic numbers as people continue to go out in person? The second issue is duplication. There’s no reason to own tsm and intc, bmbl and mtch, cloudflare and crowdstrike, etc at the same time. Pick one and keep it moving. Imo some of these names will come back in 5 years. Others won’t. Therefore do a whittling down process to eliminate duplication, get rid of 1/2-2/3 of the portfolio, and keep ko and tsla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 14:17:01'] Sell all that are more than 50% down. Rest start selling covered calls

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:08:44'] Sell it all before they become bigger losses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:31:19'] Looks fairly tech heavy. I’m a long term guy so I tend to set and forget, and just sweat out the down times. I’d look outside of tech for some of your next purchases though. Over 15 years my best performers outside of giants are what I call my ‘socially irresponsible portfolio’. Trash, guns, tobacco, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:11:55'] I'd say sell most of your losers and put that into ETFs for diversification purposes. Your portfolio is very tech heavy and by the looks of it chosen by if things are trendy or not at the time. Example: Zoom, which was worth more than 490 in October 2020 due to the pandemic. Dollar-cost averaging that to a lower cost basis is going to take ages with little certainty for the future or reward. If you really want to pick individual stocks some tips: check if companies actually make money, check if they are in a hype bubble (like AI now the new big thing is, but Blockchain had that spot a few years ago), and switch up your choices of industry. Or just yolo it all on 0DTE option gambles and become a prized member of the WSB wall of shame.Also do your own research and don't follow what Reddit says too much.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:27:41'] I'd say not much you can do. Either sell all and rebuild your portfolio or start saving cash and cross your fingers that these positions will bounce back.Either way you have to start with building up a ETF portfolio. Only then can you start investing into stocks like match and bumble. starting off with putting money on tech IPO's with terrible fundamentals is gambling not investing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:50:23'] Ever heard of low cost index funds?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:22:16'] Not good to help you now but the future I would STRONGLY suggest stop losses.  You can adjust them regularly but they really help to lock in gains or minimize losses. Remember there is no perfect trade, if you make money it's a win

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:18:31'] One needs to be sensitive to earning data. When they report a bad earning looks like a dud dump it before it gets further lower.  Zoom was only a hype during lock down. TDOC losses of EPS (TTM)	-$43.06. BMBL perpetuate earnings and losses since ipo in 2021 should serve as a wake up call. Unload 1/2 and start over is my best advice.

Merely begin with the mindset of beating the interest rate on your best certified deposit rates. Even if your returns barely amount to anything, at least a little money in the market will probably keep you interested in learning how to make smarter moves.Your problem is a psychological one. You invest like a poor person. That's why you're making yourself poor.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:36:02'] Give each non-Intel company a hard look and ask "What does this look like in 5-10 years?  What can the balance sheets of each tell me?  What's their competition?  Which ones have an edge in the market and can they keep it?  Can I trim a few positions down and/or consolidate?"  Depending on the answers, you can either find a good tech ETF with some of those in it or not.  Keep your shares of Coca-Cola and Intel.  Good luck and don't get in over your head.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:47:40'] Just invest in the total market and if you want to individually get stocks, invest in what you know. You seem all over the place so I wonder what made you decide to get each one of those stocks. I have 5 stocks that I know.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:51:59'] tsmc and ko are fine. only risk to tsmc is if china invades. the rest you need to ask yourself why you invest in them and can they survive another year or so. all these companies need is to really start growing then you can make some good money so the ones you believe in the most start averaging down and once this recession is done you'll make some good money. other than that you can just liquidate and put it in an index fund.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 17:59:26'] EVs will always be a niche market in the States. Gas burners will be around long after all of us are gone. Ford is circling the drain to oblivion, couple more years and their gone or bought by someone. The rest will survive with a 70/30 mix of gas/EV production. Tesla knows what the others don't already, you can't mass produce EVs and make money unless you sell them for $ 90 k. Same reason Tesla hasn't brought a truck to production, those will have to have a $ 130k price point to be profitable. Tesla has been making a ton of money off the niche market, hence the P/E. Will the others hurt Tesla, I would say yes, but it's still too early tell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 05:56:00'] Short answer is yes. Half these legacy automakers won’t exist anymore in 15 years. They are generating almost 100% of their revenue from the manufacture and sale of outdated obsolete technology. Startups are clapped now thanks to the macroeconomic headwinds. Tesla is in a very enviable position.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 06:13:52'] If.If that somehow haven't materialized for decades.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 11:37:56'] I think one thing that I overlooked is how advanced Teslas deep learning tech is. Note: not self driving capability, but deep learning capability.Please correct me if I’m wrong here b/c I’m not an expert in automotive industry, but from my understanding most are not as advanced as Tesla is in this aspect.As AI/ML/deep learning becomes more ingrained to our lives, Tesla will be uniquely positioned to manufacture and develop cars with these capabilities.A common argument thrown around is there deep learning companies like Waymo, etc. This is kind of true, but only kind of. The approach between Waymos and Tesla to ML is very different.Given that markets are forward looking, in a weird way it kind of makes sense?EDIT: this is if we believe that AI/ML will be as impactful as the creation of the internet was.

To the rest of us, TSLA shows a clean breakout of the 2023 high above 220 and if the market cooperates should be on its way to 240 area. A pullback to the 222 area would be a potential spot to add.That said, market is very extended here and due for a pullback, so TSLA might have to wait. Gravity may win in the short-term.

Given the fact the extra liquidity these companies are enjoying due to crypto is a major contributor. Tesla is overvalued definitely, but there has been no significant catalyst produced to provide proof of doubt a out its future projects. They just do very well to keep it under the rug.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 04:44:07'] Nobody cares about PE anymore. It’s irrelevant for the big tech giants. It’s such a lazy way of thinking to just draw a line on historic PE’s and say this is where it should be because this is where it’s been in the past. Tech giants have almost limitless growth, they are immune to lots of the analysis and scrutiny we apply to other stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 17:31:09'] Tesla is the canary in the coal mine. Tesla isn't worth a trillion, or to be included with the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Google. The speculative bubble bursting is probably going to start with Tesla and hit bitcoin and everywhere else people are just punting, and will be triggered by interest rate hikes to combat inflation. All these SPACs, shitcoins and a large part of the tech sector is going to be in trouble when having debt costs money again.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 16:41:16'] It will only matter when it comes crashing down.   Every car manufacturer in the world is in the EV game now and they have a far superior production model and experience with actually building cars.    Better options.   Better prices.   Better built.  And it will only get worse for tesla.  Teslas are sort of ugly to boot tbh.There is nothing special or unique about tesla today.  It is not 3 years ago.   If they don't make huge advancements in their battery tech to keep some sort of edge PE will matter quite a lot.   Best of luck to all you bag holders out there.  Get out before the fall is my advice.  Its fall might not be right away but you do not own the next ford.  You can do well in the short run maybe but its not a forever hold.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 18:48:42'] Yes it matters because stock valuation is not arbitrary.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 19:40:00'] The bear argument is that Tesla is a car company and a software company and a remarkably capable hardware company and a solar company and a power utility company.  But I think the big play here is batteries.   Everyone’s got batteries.  Ford, GM, VW, Toyota.  But do they?   Do they have batteries at production scale?   Tesla is producing car size batteries more than 10x faster than anyone else including Nio.   For the next 5 years, at least, the EV wars will be fought and won with batteries.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 19:47:16'] While PE is always an interesting metric to look at, it can be somewhat irrelevant for growth stocks that are more or less reinvesting all of their revenue and potential profit into, well, growth.  GOOG and AMZN are good examples, although they now have amazing earnings.  I think for big growth tech stocks, it's probably more useful to look at the PS ratio and you can then extrapolate what potential earnings will be based on their industry.  Either way, TSLA is at something like 25 price to sales ratio.  Does it make sense to you that a) you should buy a company at 25 times their current total revenue or b) do you believe their revenue will double, then double, then double, then double once again to bring it in line with the historic averages of the auto industry?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-09 11:00:43'] As others have pointed out, if you only judge companies based on PE ratio, you miss out on a lot of good companies.  P/E is a backwards looking metric. The stock price is typically more forward looking. That doesn't mean the stock price might not be too high. But if TSLA continues to grow its revenue, the stock price will continue to reflect that. Eventually the growth will slow and the stock price will level out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 18:54:35'] Tesla is an overvalued joke. Musk is an incompetent twat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:52:12'] I’ll assume what you read was referring to day trades. Most brokerages don’t let you do more than 3 day trades in a given amount of time, meaning you can’t buy and sell a position (a stock) in the same day.If your buy TSLA at 9am then sell it at 1pm that would be 1 day trade.Idk for sure I would need to know what brokerage this is and what restrictions they place on its traders. There shouldn’t be any restrictions on simply on how many trades you make other than day trades. (Might depend on country I can only speak for the US)I’ve sold 3 positions and bought 3 new positions or more several times with no warning or restriction
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 15:48:30'] Are you referring to limits on day trading?That just means you can’t buy and sell the same stock in the same day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 03:34:35'] Switch to a cash account. No day trade restrictions. You may trade up to the amount of settled cash each day. Cash used for options settle overnight so you can start with your whole portfolio the next day. Shares settle over two nights. Keep your trades very small until you understand what all this means.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 21:36:26'] If you make four (not three) day trades **while using a margin account** in any 5 trading day period (not business days), and on the day you make the 4th day trade you have less than 25,000$ ending balance in your account, you will receive a PDT flag (pattern day trader flag).   A "day trade" is where you buy a stock (or an option) and you then sell the stock (or option) on that same trading day. You can avoid this by using a **cash account**, but with cash accounts you need to pay attention to your settled cash balance. If you made a trade or 2 in the day already and you buy a stock with unsettled funds (funds for stock buys/sells settle in 2 trading days, options settle in 1 trading day) and you close it, you will receive a good faith violation. If you don't know what these are, you shouldn't be touching options, let alone stocks - but that's my 0.02. Best of luck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:55:37'] To keep it as simple as possible (some differences here or there).  If you want to open and close a trade within one trading day more than 3 times in 5 days (stocks, ETF ,. Futures or options) you will need $25k or more in your account.  If you have less than $25k at end of day closing your account may be locked and you will be stopped from OPENING more trades after your 3 trade and only allowed to close trades.  So, just get $30k in your account, do small trades and you have no worries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:24:31'] Following
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 20:19:59'] The day trading rule is for margin accounts under 25k. If you do not have 25k in your account and you want to daytrade you will have to switch to a cash account.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 21:28:43'] If you’re only flipping premium, no need for margin. Cash account even if you have a million dollars. Makes no sense to have margin in that account. You can day trade your account value all day making day trades, but if you’re trading your whole balance in 1 day, you will blow up anyway. When I started trading full time, I went strictly cash with way over 25k. Margin makes no sense in options trading unless you’re shorting them which I don’t do and I don’t recommend anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 10:05:24'] Those are day trades. Every new order opened and closed in the same day counts towards that limit. Opening today and closing tomorrow does not count.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 23:58:00'] Daytrading if you have under $25k is restricted because they want to keep the poor poor. Won't let you sell a stock the same day you bought it, but will let companies dilute and take your money after hours. Be careful out there...

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 20:49:16'] 2022 total EV production was around 800k. Tesla was around 550k of that 800k. In 2023 they are estimated to produce around 1.2 million car. More than double. They are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. In comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That’s per company. There isn’t a company that can produce at Tesla’s speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it’s going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That’s 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that’s a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. I know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. Tesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That’s 14 years. That’s millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla. By the time the other companies catch up it will be too late. Tesla is KING!!!!

This is their first EV…they are going to become more and more efficient at making them as they evolve their supply chain and manufacturing operations. Being unprofitable on a per-unit basis in this segment with your entry vehicle isn’t a huge red flag to me. They’re playing catch up and where willing to enter early while cost of production is still high for them.

POST_TEXT: b"Hello and thanks for the advice and anything in the comments.\n\nSo basically Today I bought TSLA Calls when TSLA was at 230.10 \n\n\\- I sold for $300 profit and was happy, the sale happened around 231 I believe.\n\nIm happy I close my computer go to the gym and eat, Im at peace. However I look at close and its at 237 after hours, I sit there looking at potentially over 5k profit I could of had and Idk how to feel rn. Like dam man that's a tough one to take on the chin especially as a 20yr with 4k in the robin hood account I feel very rough right now.\n\nI know there's millions of other opportunities but how do I forget this and just be happy I took healthy profit and move on... How do I stop this from making me money hungry and chasing tomorrow?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 14:13:30'] Sounds like your greed is starting to come out. Just remember, any profit is better than losses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 16:17:54'] best advice would be to try and imagine it was completely opposite and it tanked and if you held you would have lost it all. gotta think from different perspectives in my opinion
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 14:21:16'] There will always be a opportunity to make more money than how much you made, weather that’s in that day, in that hour, or in that minute, there was almost always a better bet to make. But you have literally no way of knowing where that bet is and when to make it.No one knows what the stock market will do least of all investors. If you made gains know you are doing better than about 80% of retail investors. I would suggest not to shoot for the top 1% of winners as that usually just means you got lucky more than anything. Dont try to time the market. Be happy you made a good move and feel good about, never feel bad that you didn’t make the perfect move (almost no one will).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 15:00:39'] If you sold at $300 profit, what makes you think you would not have sold at $500. Profit is profit. Learn to scale out of positions if you think they still have room to run.Above all you didn’t lose money so be happy about that. Work on being a consistent winner first and refining your edge (this usually takes years) Don’t worry about maximizing winners. Just win.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 15:58:29'] Live your emotion. Be mindful of it. Accept it has it comes to you. You can't not be affected psychologically, but you can feel ok about it. Take some time to recover from that emotion before taking other important decisions. There's an emotional learning that has to be made to be able to survive the game and it takes time. This is normal. Follow your plan and be grateful when the market is kind enough to give you some money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 16:30:45'] I find cocaine helps me through psychological difficulties
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:16:14'] I’d turn it around and look at what made you trade in the first place. You sound like you had no plan. What was the profit you aimed for ? If it was $300, you made 100% of it and it was an excellent trade. If it’s $600, you made 50% and it wasn’t excellent. Based on that, I’ll say feel lucky cause you went gambling and got home with $300. It could have been $0
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:28:07'] You can never bet enough on the winning horse.   Take the money and be happy you took profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:35:58'] This is all hindsight, if tsla tanked you wouldn’t have made this post.In reality you didn’t miss any profits since you weren’t there to take it. There are trades that go 1000%+ every single day and you aren’t here saying I missed xyz. The only way you could have missed that trade is if you saw the setup and didn’t execute. THATS missing a trade. Following your plan and executing it is all you have to do. Anything else is your emotions taking over your mind

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-07 05:47:55'] You can’t argue with the fantastic return and the company definitely has value.However, I think it’s now more in the euphoric stage of valuation and has plenty of room for correction. Things going for the company (outside of the intrinsic value) include the fact that corporations are entering a spending cycle (with a lot of cash on hand) and could follow Hertz. And for the time being Tesla seems to have been able to deal with supply chain issues.The biggest risk is probably central banks / feds being trigger happy. And / or trade disputes could reignite with China and limit teslas ability to push into the Chinese market. Personally, I’ve taken some gains and limited my exposure to ETFs that have opted to include Tesla.Good luck!

Chances are you too won't have any money to buy anything when the next dip comes. Eventually you'll find your gains wither over time. You just happened to get started near the bottom of a big rally. You could have bought dog shjt and made money.I think most your picks are crap. META, AAPL, SNAP are all garbage.I think AAPL and MSFT will be the biggest disappointment for the next 20 years.

If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year. If the PE ratio of the entire market is lower now that it has been in the last 30 years you may want to increase your stock holdings.However, I doubt that that making such adjustments to your portfolio will really help you. It is almost impossible to correctly time the market. I know that these statements will not hold you back. They do not even hold me back.

POST_TEXT: b'Literally every other stock in my portfolio has increased in value since I bought TSLA in mid-January, not just the meme stocks (RH, H, HLT, MAR, HST, SI, KR, MSFT, GM, etc, etc, etc - and all the ETFs: IVV, SPLV, VOO, and VTI). Meanwhile TSLA share price has done nothing but drop.\n\nGuess what else has outperformed TSLA? All the crypto currency Im holding. Elon Musk is a chump.\n\nFords unveiling of the F-150 lightening wasnt as hyped as the cybertruck, but Ford didnt break their own trucks window on stage. I strongly suspect sales of Fords electric truck will stomp the cybertruck, because it appeals to the established truck-buyer market far better than some ridiculous looking techie spacemobile. I only see TSLA getting weaker from here.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 04:30:22'] I normally look for a good company that is damaged, and invest in that. I always get feedback like that they're going to go bankrupt or I'm going to lose my money some other way. But so far the strategy has worked for me.The reality is, if you invest in a company at its peak, what direction can it go?In comparison, if you invest in a company that is damaged, but is a good company, where can it go?Think carnival Cruise line during the peak of the pandemic.  CCL, RCL, BA, RYCEY.....etc, etc...
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:37:46'] That's the risk of buying something when its high and hope that it continues to rise.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 08:47:46'] So basically..."Elon Musk is a chump. That stupid idiot broke the window of his ridiculous looking space-mobile on stage. I'm going to buy their stock."Less than 5 months later..."This stock is a piece of shit because it has been almost 5 months already and it hasn't made me any money!"I don't think you invested in Tesla for the right reasons. I would never invest in a company where I think their CEO is a chump and their products are ridiculous. Why would you do that? And I would never invest in a company expecting it to make me money within 5 months. Even the very best companies could experience an unpredictable downturn on that short of a time frame. I'm invested in Tesla because I strongly believe in their CEO, their products, and believe the stock price will be far higher a decade from now than it is right now. I don't care about the next 5 months.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 04:43:50'] I sold my Tesla in Jan. But I bought early last year. Unfortunately you bought at the top. Also doesn't help that Michael Burry is shorting  Telsa currently it seems amond other HF I assume as well. I still think Telsa is a good company but at the Jan price that's too high for my blood. Competition will be good for EV.  I am looking to see what Lucid and Ford will bring to the game.  Will be good all around as the EV playing field gets some balance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 08:52:53'] TSLA is a long term hold .. I’ll be buying Tesla even if it hits 1K
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:56:50'] 😭😭😭😭😭😭
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 04:10:09'] I’m not an investor in Tesla. There is a ton I admire about the company and its founder, mostly the audacious courage to pioneer and attempt to flight a competitor to the motor industry. There is also a lot I detest. The overriding factor for me though, is that for me, especially at my stage of life, investing in a totally blue sky venture is not appropriate.  The point I’m making is that TSLA is very different to many of the other companies you mention, it is important to know what you’re investing in and what your expectations /  scenarios were for your investment, and to adjust your decision as to whether to invest and how much.  That would help managing regret.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:33:01'] Michael Burry bought put options on TSLA couple weeks or months ago when it was 700$USD +. Waayyyy overvalued business. Overhyped CEO. And as you said, competition will get better at electric cars and will sell products that people will actually buy. The cybertruck is trash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:37:31'] Bruh like... Every trade went negative when I trade with tesla
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 04:30:05'] I bought in earlier this year (just a few shares) when TSLA dipped to around $700 and started climbing. And then it dropped, and then dropped some more. I pretty much spent the entire spring averaging down hard until I finally got to a point where I was even and set a trailing stop. It made a little more money and stopped out soon after. I’m done with TSLA. I need to put my money to work for me, and that hyper volatile trading sideways stuff just doesn’t get it done for me. I still believe in TSLA. They are WAY more than just an electric car company and they single-handedly created the electric car market in the US. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:54:31'] Tesla is going to get absolutely wrecked when the big 3 dump EVs on the market, this has been known for years idk why people like living in denial.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 07:55:58'] It'll go back up even more, just give it time. Once everyone realizes that is about the AI not the EV that makes Tesla untouchable in the game.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 06:24:36'] I think you need to reposition your focus on the company as a whole.Tesla wall is crushing it. I believe they delivered 200k units and growing. Solar is incredibly huge right now and Tesla is leading in the space. IMO I think it will rebound or split again.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 06:30:13'] I waited for tsla to drop to $550 before I bought. Actually had an alert set for it.  Although I'm still ahead currently, It was doing very well for me until he opened his mouth again about crypto, and the announcement of Musk not getting approval of his lawyers before tweeting.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 17:16:54'] If you’re investing in TSLA because you want some short term returns you almost certainly made a mistake. I think if you had a longer timeline you would be a lot less disappointed in stocks you buy

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 19:45:56'] You literally bought a stock with unprecedented growth within the last year. Up like 400% from the last year when you bought. You would be saying the exact opposite if you bought in 6 months earlier. I don’t know what made you think buying Tesla at that point when it was clearly overvalued from memes and Elon would be a good decision. It’s the risk you take. Not every stock is a winner and not every stock will give you 200% gains in a month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 20:43:08'] I don't own TSLA, GM or F but something I have heard for more than a year now is TSLA does not trade as a AUTO manufacture it trades as a Tech stock. [https://www.investopedia.com/news/tesla-tech-company-or-car-company/](https://www.investopedia.com/news/tesla-tech-company-or-car-company/)The news and articles I have been reading indicates GM will have the first driverless taxis vehicles in the US starting in California. Why isn't GM pricing as a Tech stock?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:11:42'] The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nTesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the companys record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.\n\nTesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Teslas NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.\n\nGMs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&fo"

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 10:09:25'] This man is absolutely right. What many dumb people here don't understand is, Tesla is not a car company and is still massively undervalued. I have all my life savings now in Tesla stocks. In a few years everything we use will be made by Tesla, the average American will live in a Tesla house powered by Tesla solar roof and Tesla batteries, which is connected to Tesla cars. If you don't have a car you will move with the Tesla Robo Taxis, which will bring you to your destination in no time through the Tesla hyper tunnels. Is the destination a bit further away? You will ride in a Tesla hyperloop or SpaceX rocket. Everyone will do their vacations at the Tesla SpaceX Moon and Mars colonies and every Sunday you go to the Elon Musk church where you pray to our overlord.

POST_TEXT: b"So Im new to getting into big time stocks or more expensive stocks, however, a current theme I am seeing is that Tesla is the one (or one of) to get into. It shows future promise from what i can tell as electric is being pushed for more and more.  Some of their tech is being used elsewhere and Ive also been seeing a lot of talk about a 20 to 1 split. That being said, the last split was 5 to 1, I think. And the stock bounced back and what, doubled? Its 1k a share right now and that is kind of daunting for me to think about, but the potential seems like it's there to for sure break even or make some extra. I chickened out at 86 bucks a share a while back and now look at me. 1000 the. Would be 10-11k now. Im just curious what everyones thoughts are? Concerns? It has a Buy rating last I checked. But again, I could be thinking about this allllllllll wrong and just be out a grand for nothing. Thanks and goodluck to everyone on your trades."
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 13:15:16'] Ratings don't matter shit. It's some banker trying to make money.The price/share has nothing to do with value. I can start a company with 3 shares. I put in 7.5K and want to sell dolls. I have 0 customers and sell my shares for 2.5K/share.  You need to see what % you own of a GOOD company. That means checking price/turnover, price/book value, price/earnings, checking the balance sheet. This might sound hard. But even google finance offers a lot of info in a 5 sec search.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 12:29:13'] i dont know what is going on with all these posts of clueless people. Stop. Read a book and get informed about value investment/growth stocks etc etc. A great company can be shitty if you buy expensive. Surely an Audi A8 is a great car, but if someone is selling it for 500k euros when the retail price is 150k, do you still think it is a great buy?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 18:31:36'] TSLA stock is a leader right now and is holding up well... but the market is going through correction. Wait for market to find a botttom first before buying
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 12:27:54'] This is a bad time to be “getting into big time stocks” You might as well spend that $1000 on 10 ugly hookers or 2 hot ones. I prefer the 10.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 12:07:42'] My last acqusition on Tsla paid $368 in March 2020.  A friend bought it around the same time putting every saving he got. 6 months later he annoucement early retirement from Google as he accumulated 7 figures in that stock.  We both have equal chance starting from the same ground.  He doubled down and I bought double shares.  The difference between "*down"* and "s*hares"* is just 1 word. The outcome is very different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 06:58:38'] Tesla is the most overpriced nonsense stock I have ever seen in my entire life. Even if by some miracle Tesla would sell more cars than all other car manufacturers combined, it would still be overpriced. Musk fanboys are not real investors. They are cultists.

POST_TEXT: b'Everyone knows TSLA is "overvalued" right? The thing is, Musk is a fucking GREAT CEO. It doesn\'t matter what you think TSLA\'s valuation is because as long as Musk is running it it will continue to succeed IMO. Why? because of things like this:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-taps-market-rally-keg-145407552.html\n\nTesla did the same thing back in February, almost immediately after the stock hit $1000/share, and then priced the offering at $767 to raise $2 billion. A few months before that people were afraid they were going to have to file bankruptcy, but with that offering they rescued themselves and gleaned the cash they needed to keep going. Now, after a 5:1 split and another MASSIVE run to pre-split prices of almost $2.5k, ol musky boy files a $5 billion shelf which basically means they can now sell up to 5 billion in shares whenever they want. You better believe that a big chunk of this will be sold in the near future, and they will raise billions in cash at these ridiculous va'

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 09:27:12'] I'd argue he isnt a fucking GREAT CEO because of how many stupid things he says on twitter that should have gotten him in a lot more legal trouble than it did and how many times they missed their production estimates over the years.What he is excellent at though is convincing people to give him their money (raise capital). For shareholders that is as good as a great CEO.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:25:24'] For the first time ever you can buy tsla without paying for loses.  Thats right, tsla has the best P/E in its history, a non-negative one!  This makes it historically massively undervalued in its relation to this arbitrary metric that everyone here finds importance in for companies that are vastly different, with negative growth, and depressing negative share prices.  But those companies are “value” because they are cheap....Ill keep putting my money on the guy who built his own autonomous robo-rocket, to launch the electric sports car he built into outer space.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 05:40:11'] So the big question is after the stock split at what price would you consider buying TSLA stock
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 08:13:46'] You realize that what you said "as long as Musk is running it..." is due diligence against the stock? People buying the stock would be counting on profit 10-15 years away at this point. First off that's insane based on fundamentals. Second, he doesn't have a right hand guy. If anything happens to him, it's over. The connection between neuralink, space x, etc. all goes away.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-03 10:56:13'] I don’t think Tesla is overvalued right now. It is rightly valued now. Investors have started to understand the true potential of Tesla now.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 05:24:07'] Three possible reasons I would consider the same right off the back:1. It's expected that the Biden administration will not be as forwarding of tech as during the time Trump was in office, thus the high profitable tech era may slow down.2. The positive outlook on the end of Covid and lockdowns due to the recent announcements in vaccine trials and related...3. The flow of stock market money away from tech stocks into other industries and away from those currently overvalued/priced tech companies.If you wanna buy low and sell high, well it's the time to sell after a long bull run on tech and buy what is currently cheap as a result of the pandemic. It's a gamble that may pop y off.For those quoting the past disastrous performance (portafolio value down from $17.52B to $12.92B), SoftBank just learned a $4.5B lesson. Having worked in corporate settings, I can suspect that they have adjusted their strategies and dumped the previously not working one.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 21:07:07'] I deliberately avoided editorializing the title, but I find too many value investors are throwing their hands up and avoiding any serious scrutiny into the current valuation of TSLA, and particularly how it's defied basically any value-oriented analysis over the last decade. Prof. Damodaran shows his usual honesty and rigor by taking on both topics on this lightning rod of a stock. Besides being the world's 5th largest publicly-traded company, TSLA is literally half of the automobile sector at over $1T valuation. No one is obligated to take a position on it of course, but dismissing its entire run as irrational and acting like there are no lessons to be learned is cowardly, IMO.Prof. Damodaran, for his part values it at $571, making it overvalued to be sure. But that also implies that TSLA was not so absurdly expensive as recently as 3 months ago. I think a key observation on his part is that TSLA hasn't actually exceed his 2013 estimates of 2021 revenue and margin. But notably, rather than easing into mature growth rates and margin expansion, TSLA seems to be accelerating over the last two years. A 2013 DCF with 2021 as its terminal year would've almost certainly underestimated TSLA because it would've assumed their growth would be slowing down rather than speeding up.

You never take profit and just hold them for 10 years, no matter what? I bought like 10 stocks in 2022 that went up between 20 and 30%... but never took profit. Some of them went back down and are at the beginning, so 0% profit in those stocks now. How do you deal with that? Do you set an alarm when the stock goes up 30% you sell, or how do you do it?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:49:26'] If I had 1 BTC I am never going to hand over half of it in return for a Tesla that has now depreciated in value the moment I drive it away.  Surely the number of people that now have 1 BTC is getting fewer and fewer. It makes no sense to pay via BTC unless there is some discount on offer.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:26:21'] Any gains they hope to make as the value of BTC inflates would be gains on the massive holding of BTC that Tesla already has. Perhaps they would buy more before it goes up too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:29:10'] ill disagree.Elon is a smart business man. He wants BTC to fund a new economy on mars. He'll take BTC at any price. He doesnt actually care about tesla the way he does spacex. he sees tesla as a vehicle to get him to mars. BTC will likely either become a store of value bigger than gold or a global reserve currency. Either way, the final resting value of BTC will be significantly higher than 100K. we will likely hit 100k in the coming months. this is what elon and cathy actually know. the prize is holding BTC.In order for musk to sell a tesla for BTC he will likely offer a small discount off the retail price for BTC instead of USD.....as all merchants accepting btc currently do.following your theory would simply handcuff BTC which would go against his plan for a new economy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 08:13:10'] Thank you for this. This is an extremely good look at the fundamentals of the company. The largest problem for me with Tesla is that I think many people underestimate some of the competition and overestimate the rate at which a large portion of the population wants to adopt EVs. While I do think it is the future, I think the vast majority of the (US) population will accept EVs too late for Tesla to still have the first movers advantage over the legacy automakers.

The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse.  Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed.  You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 14:57:59'] You have huge amounts of retail investors with their iPhone following these “investing gurus” on their tiktok pages pumping TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-09 01:49:19'] Many of the people that hold Tesla stock believe so strongly in Tesla's future prospects that they are extremely unlikely to sell anytime soon for any reason.Plus, Tesla is so popular and so many people have FOMO over it that any significant dip would be seen as a "buy the dip" opportunity and quickly be bought back up, so a crash is very unlikely to happen anytime soon.The only thing that I could see causing Tesla to crash is if they somehow lost Elon Musk since for many people their investment in Tesla is an investment in Elon Musk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 21:22:22'] Of course he will,  but he needs to adjust the valuation first, Look I absolutely love Tesla, it is light years ahead of competitors, but production numbers and quality as well , also other competitors kicking into market in the next year or two, is going to effect big time unfortunately, -  Meanwhile short term investors can enjoy- but when the slope changes, it is going to bring down SP500, DJI, RUSS2000, and the rest of indexes at least 30%. If I am the owner of such successful company I will put together a giant plan before that moment come, it is not gonna grow for ever, Basic understanding, young, new investors can put as much as they can into it, but at some point soon they have to face difficult choice of holding by losing or profiting by selling.Just my thought.

From january onwards, no actual gains for Tesla. \n\nWHY? Well, it is nice to catch a wave, a wave of good will, being the only one outthere building electric cars (not true, Toyota had them since the 80's), a wave of private investors ditching out money on reddit feeds and robinhood push to help you rise despite poor performance. But duh, if you are Elon Musk it does not matter if you don't know everything about the car you are presenting, it doesn't matter if an UNBREAKABLE window breaks during presentation, your shares will rise. \n\nBut now, people have the tools to DD and they notice a PE of 1260, an EPS of 0.62 generated on government subsidies, no profit from selling cars, recall of more than 130.000 cars, a quarter of TESLA's entire"
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 00:49:55'] You will have mostly bulls in this forum when it comes to Tesla. So opinions might be skewed towards buying the dip, not sure how much insights you'll get from this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 02:40:10'] Your statistics on car sales include ICE vehicles. Tesla will produce significantly more vehicles this year than last year, and significantly more than that in 2022. The only reason Tesla is relying on the credits to make a profit is because they are investing into the future of the company so heavily. Building out 3 gigafactories at the same time is expensive, not to mention the new supercharger factories. I’m not saying the valuation isn’t high based on today’s metrics, but this company has always been priced several years ahead of themselves. That $25k car in 2023 is gonna sell as fast as they can make them, and if they get the robotaxi network going, you’ll wish you could buy Tesla for $800.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 00:55:10'] According to the new trend-following method I am trying to teach myself to use, so I am less of a chump as I was last February, RSI falling below 44 is bearish, and the MACD is really bearish. If it drops below the 50 day MA it will fall much further and/or face various challenges. Trouble is, everyone knows this so it will be hitting stops the closer it gets. The biggest question is, is it a long term hold or short term for you? Assuming you’re an American where that matters. Here’s a chart: https://imgur.com/a/5Y2PihG

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 04:00:58'] Tesla is up 400% since a year ago. It needs awesome earning for the next 5-10 years to even come close to justifying its current price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 03:49:34'] Sometimes a stock price grows faster than a company financially.  The company is trading very expensive,  so news like this generally creates a sell off. Just remember,  a great company doesn't necessarily make a great stock.  It all comes down to what you pay for the growth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 08:36:03'] I do own some tesla shares . . . but this is what gets me . . . . > Net profit reached a quarterly record of $438 million on a GAAP basis, and the company recorded $518 million in revenue from sales of regulatory credits during the period. It also recorded a $101 million positive impact from [sales of bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/teslas-bitcoin-speculation-helped-boost-profits-this-quarter.html) during the quarter. 518+101=617 million from NON auto sales.  438-617=-179 million.So essentially tesla is 179 million in the minus as a car manufacturer.The regulatory credits will eventually not be there.  And who knows what will happen with bitcoin over the coming years.Just my non professional investor opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 05:37:36'] it's very possible tsla trades sideways between 650 - 900 or maybe 950 until q2/q3 numbers confirm they're going to deliver on 1M+ vehicles 2021. when model Y really picks up in 2022 things will get interesting, and i think when they release a <25k vehicle and the roadster and cybertruck that'll increase, along with their new plants ramping up production.    yeah, it's trading at a high valuation - but there's enough people to buy and hold that it's really hard to see how tsla isn't trading at a bare minimum 25% higher next year. the tsla dynamic is also on hold while the market figures out what to do with hyper growth stocks. those are all in a holding pattern until more certainty is in the market.  if you're bullish - use the headlines and uncertainty to buy at good prices.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 14:10:38'] Significant portion of their profit came from sell of Bitcoin, not cars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 14:33:12'] I think this should have been totally expected and seems to be the pattern. When rumors fly of a big earnings day for any stock it starts to trend upwards a month before and when earnings are released there is a sell off. Not everyone holds long term, there are a lot of swing traders out there. It'll start to climb back up over the next month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 14:45:40'] Competition in the EV space is getting stiffer by the day.  Do you really believe they are going to grow into the currently insane valuation?  Without that crypto sale these guys are red for the quarter
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 04:06:56'] Tesla right now is pretty much what it was when it was trading at 400-500 and heavily shorted - by that I don't mean circumstances but the stock stopping to move while everyone waits to see whether the company can keep its word real or fail. My concern is that bad news start to pile up, a lot of these are minor and non critical if dealt with, but as a pure growth stock any bad news, even if it turns out not to be your fault but the driver, is a huge risk factor.I believe they actually have a solid chance to outgrow Apple, Microsoft and Amazon if they do what they say - they have hands in EV, AI, Space and more, all heavily future based. The only good part right now is that the gap between overvaluation and reality gets smaller, since the stock plunged and stop growing, but the drop from nearly 900 to 500 shows how big that gap still is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 15:33:20'] Signs of resession = stocks will edge higher but not enter back into a new bull market until the pivot. Market will trade sideways in this bear market until there is sufficient corporate cut backs and layoffs and the economy will be hanging on the verge of collapse. Then rates will be cut.  Bulls will take over. Rinse, repeat. I’m 49% down. Hanging on as best I can and DCA into spy, vo and a few others but damn this is so stressful.Wake me next year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 15:04:03'] fuck china
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 16:30:47'] No.  It just means that they have a camp to concentrate the population for better control over it.  On top of that, if they can pay for a new camp like this, why can they not pay into the climate control accords?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:00:22'] Always amazing to see what they get done in  such short amount of time but here I'm my town they have been widening the same section of highway for over a year already!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:34:57'] They’ve been doing camps for decades. I think they keep somewhere around 3 million Muslims in camps in western China. Some for doing things like “your mom read you the Koran 30 years ago”
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:02:22'] In comparison, it only took California 14 years and 4 Billion dollars to build a high speed train that goes from the middle of nowhere to the middle of nowhere.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 14:24:35'] 'built'You can see the trucks in the picture delivering these premade boxes. It's like stacking shipping containers on top of each other. They just have to connect the pre-done plumbing and wiring. Not sure what they're going to do about the roofs of these because they'll have water running down wherever they meet the next unit, messing up the wiring if they don't do anything about it. Ultimately this is just a photo op because they would have been much better off just building things in place (on actual foundations). Instead they built off-site and then had to ship, place, and tie in all of these parts. It'll instead be lower quality (more leaks, worse foundations) and likely higher cost total than doing normal construction.If anything this confirms my view on investing in China, which is to not ever. They care more about the party's image than anything else. They will cheat and steal at any opportunity and have found western investors to be overly trusting and rich targets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 14:08:06'] China is permanently fucked as long as the Panda 🐼 Man thinks he can do this indefinitely
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 18:27:33'] I mean yes and no. China has long been an over reaching global and economic power. Most of their decisions have resulted in either social or economic lash back. At the end of the day, they need to be stopped. For many reasons, but the amount of pure over fishing and industrial runoff is enough to warrant action.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:56:16'] Covid re education camps. There are many other better investments than China. China is a dumpster fire ready to turn into a while inferno right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:32:18'] Why are they still so paranoid about covid? The rest of the world has pretty much gotten past it… do they know something we don’t..?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 14:36:58'] They are preparing for war. Those will be hospitals and staging areas.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 09:04:08'] Well a Chine is not an asset class it is a market…. It does not change my mine, my mine was made up that it is a terrible investment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 01:11:27'] When you can't keep building empty cities to use construction as a prop for your economy, build detention centers.  Hey it's not like the rest of the world did anything when you burnt the first few thousand people you quarantined and the satellite footage and chemical tracking proved it was burning human bodies.  Your china! you can do whatever you want cause no one wants to start a war with the country that can literally just throw more bodies than any one else has at the problem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:26:43'] If all else fails, they do have nukes and likely would shoot them at a 90 degree angle as population control.  How much can you really trust the China stock market?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:58:10'] China is a social experiment for the future world ahead which is bleak and oppressive
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 13:19:18'] China is good at building stuff. So what? Doesnt matter if they dont invest in their own people. Their gdp per capita is near mexico levels. Meaning its bad.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:02:40'] China has potential and growth...but at what coat?Nope I'm betting on India,  Brazil, Turkey,  Peru, Mexico, Argentina,  and Vietnam.  They slightly less oppressive
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:44:48'] Always amazed by the speed at which they build anything. I believe there is huge potential in that market which will open up after covid is done in the country, hopefully sometime next year. No doubt its more riskier considering the government but also more potential for good gains
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 13:42:23'] Not sure about these quarantine centers. I always ask myself if China knows something about the Coronavirus, that the rest of the world is missing...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:18:31'] It is guaranteed that China will become the leading economy this century, in total size. Worth investing? No-one knows.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:37:56'] My understanding is that the issue has never been about their ability to grow or rate of growth but that their equities do not reflect the economies growth. Kind of like how precious metals prices are detached from physical reserves.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 12:43:01'] Didn’t they build a thing very similar to this at the start of the pandemic and then it collapsed after a few months?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 15:03:30'] I think I used to pass by here every now and then when I lived in Guangzhou
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 15:13:46'] The lack of any reasonable transparency in the country prevents me from any significant exposure to their markets. That's not going to change soon.. if I miss big moves because of that, it's the cost of doing business.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 03:14:55'] Somehow dictators eventually always seem to mismanage their economy into a total collapse. This zero covid policy is a shining example of this. The rest of the world has moved on due to vaccinations but somehow the Chinese government seems hell bent imprisoning their people and destroying their economy. Doesn't seem like a sustainable situation to me but I have no trust in it ending soon. I never invested in Chinese companies because I felt their government can do whatever irrational thing to any company at any time. And here we are.

Notice the cranes, lack of outer walls on every building, lack of roofs, some buildings are missing entirely from their lots. China needs you to invest so they can finish building this wasteful nonsense.   I also think it's a lovely comeuppance that the rest of the world has by-in-large moved on from Covid and these jabronis are trapped by their own failure, inept hierarchy, and "zero covid" propoganda.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-23 15:13:12'] Any moment in the past 5 years would be a good time to invest in Tesla. 2 weeks from now -will also probably be a good time to invest in Tesla (Unless you're reading this the year 2099 and Tesla is fucked by then).
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 08:08:12'] TSLA ascending triangle from 9/8 - current with resistance @~460. full close on 11/12 breakout could occur 10/28 - 11/12. i hope it will be upward.  edit:searched after posting to see what others are saying and found this take similar to mine: https://fbs.com/analytics/articles/tesla-triangle-time-27309  no affiliation.  and yes i agree with OP this would be a good buy point as TSLA is tagging the trend line / ascending line of the triangle. a (losing side) exit would be any significant drop exceeding your risk tolerance & position size below a trendline line connecting the 9/8 and 10/23 lows. winning side exit target would be first target at 492, second target 538, fly the runner target would be ~610.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-23 12:50:38'] No.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 05:44:07'] Easy buy lol, its at a support level, just put a SL below the support and you risk almost nothing with the odds of making big gains 🤷‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-25 13:31:12'] I think of this like a more volatile version of what Apple has seen the last few weeks. Leading up to the 5G event, Apple options were in high demand. This caused people to demand shares to write calls and puts. This excess demand was duplicated by speculators buying shares before the event. This created a bubble that popped when nothing unexpected came from the event. The people who bought shares for covered options don’t actually want to hold them and dumped them back on the market and other shareholders that buy rumor and sell news dumped too. That’s why Apple stock dumped all last week, lots of people dumping their shares after the event. Tesla has similar overwhelming demand for options that causes share price to bubble and after event prices to fall. I don’t know if they will follow the Apple model and take weeks to shrug off the post event share dump or whether Tesla will bounce this week. It’s hard to tell and Tesla investors tend to be aggressively buying dips, so maybe Tesla is okay this week.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 12:47:08'] Tesla is as close to a Ponzi scheme as any public company on Earth.   It is relatively financially stable due to its status as a Meme stock so was able to raise capital at very low to no cost which coupled with selling their environmental credits has allowed them to make it to the status of a small unprofitable car manufacturer.   Their autonomous driving technology is second tier.  Their solar panel company loses money.  They have convinced their marks that they have battery technology when it is their suppliers that own that technology.   They are in fact an unprofitable (except for the credits they sell which will go away in the wash of new EVs being offered by the real auto manufacturers) small auto company.I do like their products but I would much prefer to own a Cadillac Lyriq or Mercedes EQS when I come up for a new car in a year or two.  However even with the EQS having a range of 478 miles I wouldn't buy one due to range limitations.  Maybe in 10 years when recharging is quicker and as accessible as petrol stations today I would then actually own one.

I repeat, 40 years later they still did not recover.. and if they ever did, they still need to discount inflation for 40-50 years, thus they will never ever recover, not even in 100 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 07:30:49'] This type of analysis isn't really that useful because the split itself doesn't meaningfully create value and isn't intended to.

	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 11:41:23'] Generally speaking when a buyout or take private transaction is announced there is a difference between the current price and the offer price. In this case the offer is 420 and the current stock price was 344. After the deal is public the gap between the share price and offer price usually closes (eg the stock goes up) but not all the way to the offer price since it must reflect risks and uncertainties that the offer will actually be completed. The difference between the two is the markets assessment of he likelihood of the deal going through. The thing is it can take some time for equilibrium to be found and the stock price to adequately quantify these risks. So the stock will usually be volatile until then.I would find it extremely unlikely Musk would actually take the company private as you would need some type of financing for this plus the debt already on the balance sheet. (10 billion) So you would need to either get someone to write a check for 75 billion, or do an LBO for some portion of the 75B which then gets added to companies balance sheet and would add to it’s already prodigious cash burn.I think Musk is just trying to fuck with the shorts and this is an easy way to do so.
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 11:13:05'] I’m trying to figure out if it’s free money if you get in before $420

	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 11:22:54'] For anyone trading TSLA be really careful.  There is a lot of short interest in the stock, and this recent news has the potential to force a brutal short squeeze.  Personally I don't like trading these sorts of stocks.  Too risky.
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 11:29:15'] You’re not breaking any rules. People just downvote because they’re sad people 
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 17:04:02'] Tesla is a terrible business to LBO. LBO's require a ton of leverage and then the strategy is to take the existing cash flow to service the interest and cost cut the business back into profitability and then sell or relist. Tesla has no where near the cash flow needed to service the high yield debt that would be needed to take it private (rough math 8% debt to buy out 71bn worth of stock at $420 would have a interest service charge of $5.7bn per year... Telsa is forecasted to cash flow \~2-3bn next year), so you are going bankrupt before any capital expansion. And that's the bigger point. Tesla needs to raise a ton of capital to fund its future growth. Public markets are really good at doing this! Going back to VC capital with a big $420/share valuation is ass backward because the VC has to think of their own exit strategy and in 5-10 years Tesla will definitely be comped against its auto peers as it will be in full blown production / harvest. peers are value far lower. So super risky for a VC or PE vs a small start up that can still play with pie in the sky valuation thinking. Net net this was click bate. Sell.
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 15:57:44'] Out of curiosity, if you own a TSLA stock, can you refuse to sell it? 
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 14:24:15'] 420 is trolling 
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 13:17:51'] If a company goes private, they will typically buy all outstanding shares at a premium (ie. if the current share price is $400, the buyout may be for $450). Once a buyout/merger/acquisition is announced, the current market price will jump to around the buyout/merger/acquisition share price. If the company does not offer a premium, there is little incentive for current shareholders with voting rights to vote for going private and selling their shares.A market share price (after announcement) above the buyout/merger/acquisition share price typically indicates that the market thinks the offer may be raised (ex. a higher competing bid for an acquisition) while a market share price (after announcement)  below the buyout/merger/acquisition share price typically indicates the market thinks there is decent risk that the deal falls through.For your original question, the share price jumped because the market expected a >7% premium if a buyout were to occur. On a side note, I believe Elon would prefer to make Tesla private again though I doubt he has the capital and revenues needed to make this happen.

	COMMENT: ['2018-08-07 10:58:30'] I am guessing because they assume TSLA will make a lot more money being freed of regulatory constraints and then will go public in the future after it has delievered massive profits. Personally I think its a flop either way.

We look at charts not make up some bs about elon talking shit is going to make tsla tank.Say the ccp invented plasma rifles and sold them on chinazon. Though my hate for the ccp is great, I'm a still add a plasma rifle to my cart.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 08:29:50'] Following the packs crowdsourced advice is a surefire way to stay behind them and ensure you will never get in front.  If you want to break out of the pack and lead it, you have to first be willing to risk deviating and doing something completely different.  If you post about what your going to do and/or are doing and the pack agrees with you, your not deviating far enough.  You need to do something that the majority would disagree with to get ahead .

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 13:14:12'] Parked my Leaf next to a Tesla at the charger today. The Tesla was a mess, the body was poorly assembled the wheels were all gouged(that’s driver error). One of the door handles had duct tape over it. Would no buy one.

People commenting on here seem delusioned that stocks will always go up and the fed is some terrible government entity to make people lose money.

Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place. The stock market literally doubled in less than 2 years. It would be a complete policy error mistake to not scale that delusional overvalued BS down a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 11:51:09'] You can thank the republicans for giving a massive tax break that went into effect right before a global pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:04:07'] The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don’t understand what’s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn’t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don’t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.       This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out.

These are the details you should provide us with.&#x200B;Anyway I think short-term, Chinese stocks are prob. gonna have a bull run, so call options on $Kweb or $Yinn (3x bull China stocks, if your strategy does not allow options) may be a good bet.

They have their Q1 report on April 20th pre-market and i suspect they will crush the eps forecast (which is set low due to the banking crisis).Obviously I do not have a crystal ball, but this would be my bet. This might be too safe and low returns to win your competition, so i suppose you could go with something riskier.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 05:25:07'] You are right, there is still too much money in the system which postpones the recession once again
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:52:55'] My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a "bearish talking point" or "doomsday conspiracy theories."  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.I have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During "normal" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.I'm also seeing loads of "Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the "just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up" concept.Bear markets end when people who buy "real" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 17:39:09'] We have bottomed, for now. Building up bubbles is bullish. Since we hit the bottom savings have gone down for americans but not for the China, which has gone up.So what is really happening? A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.However, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn’t be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn’t crash. Everybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market “priced everything in” is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it’s forward looking…..Newsflash, it’s forward looking to “a degree”. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn’t pricing in shit. Even with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. If JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I’m studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). It is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don’t fight  “THE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED”. JPOW very commonly “spooks” the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 18:27:44'] LOL anything is possible but methinks the market is gonna make a new low below the Oct 13 bottom.The economy is strong, which is inflationary. Even if the economy was to fall into recession the federal reserve will NOT jump in to stem the tide because a recession will bring inflation down. Rates will have to keep going higher and this makes safer investments more appealing and stocks less attractive. ZIRP isn't coming back. Looking at all the facts, it's difficult not to be bearish on equities, which are still due for a reckoning.Equity investors are fighting the fed and that never ends well.

POST_TEXT: b'Read a news said that Elon is seeking new investors for Twitter at the same price he paid for it, I was wondering if this guy is trying to pull himself out of this mess he created. [And now I read this](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-asks-twitter-decide-021508126.html)\n\nJust checked the votes, there are 13 million voters with 56.6% YES and 43.4% NO. As a liar who promised not selling TSLA in the future, but repeatedly sold TSLA for accumulatively $23 billion, he has no credibility to me. I dont think he actually thinks like that, IMO, this is just some tricks he uses to make an excuse and pull himself out of this mess. Besides, if he actually quitted his CEO job of Twitter, its probably good news for TSLA as more focuses are shifted to TSLA. Anyway, I am neither holding any TSLA related position, nor a fan of Elon, just want to see how this drama ends. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hykyrmx0t6a1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aded341d7a971e49b9fd0c0632'
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 23:40:35'] Elon, keeping the popcorn market afloat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:32:33'] His TSLA sales were your sign not to trust him? Did you miss all of his crypto pump and dumps? All of his past SEC investigations? He literally bought Bitcoin, said he’d accept it for TSLA sales, watched the price of BTC rise, and then he sold BTC for a profit and later said TSLA wasn’t accepting BTC as payment anymore. The guy is a scammer that literally rips off the people that believe in him. He’s the guy that goes to his grandmas house to rummage through her purse while she makes him lunch.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 23:55:43'] It’s a cop out. He wants to quit but doesn’t want the accountability of doing it. He needs to juice Tesla stock asap. It’s a way bigger problem than his stupid Twitter investment. Has he even said why he had to sell $3B+ of Tesla stock at a 52 week low?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 07:56:14'] I think he forgot about Tesla’s base, this initial supporters who got an EV before it was cool, and his crusade against the ‘libs’ may not end well for the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:11:12'] I wish he would get back to solving world problems! (said nobody ever)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 04:04:29'] This looks like buyer's remorse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:19:18'] This is his way of pumping Tesla back up so he can sell more shares at all time highs, then he will delete the poll and ban anyone who questions it 😂
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:10:13'] Step down to save your revenue stream from the Twitter marketing machine.  You’ve been always ahead of the rest.  Do it
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:56:45'] You'd be naive to think the poll actually matters. If he really is selling Twitter to the Saudis and letting Kushner be the next CEO, then he will use his fleet of bots to spam "Yes" (heck, he doesn't even need bots to do it, one SQL command to update the count would suffice). He is just creating the illusion that whatever the result is, it came "naturally" from "real Twitter users", when in fact he always controls the poll result to his desirable outcome.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:34:47'] He wouldn’t only keep his promise here if they voted yes. His lack of self awareness has never been more clear.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 05:04:28'] I've never traded either stock and am fairly indifferent to Musk in general and I never even setup a Twitter ac ever. That said, I don't think someone that makes that kind of money did it by chance, hence he probably knows what he's doing. The results aren't working in his favor, so maybe he overestimated himself. I have no clue, not having a dog in the fight this situation is pretty entertaining. If he gets wiped out, he can't blame cancel culture or whatever it is that they blame for doing it to him and if he comes out on top, he can't really say he planned it out that way either. One way or the other, his credibility as a businessman is done and he is the only one to be held responsible for it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:24:05'] Can he also start a poll to quit Tesla while he's at it?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 04:36:15'] It’s exhausting to read all the Elon haters out there. I’ve never met him, but his StarLink product made my life a lot better. I’m not on Twitter (at least now I can call it that and not “Twatter”) or Facebook or Instagram, so I don’t follow Elon Musk around to see what mistakes he makes or promises he keeps/breaks, but he’s a businessman who has built more than 1 empire.  So…I tend to think that if he is making a move like you described, he has a good reason and a plan. I just don’t jump to a conclusion that his motives are evil right away. I have a couple inventions that I have struggled to get off the ground, so I admire someone who not only has an idea, but also the knowledge and means to bring them to market (multiple times).
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 23:57:51'] Man I'm glad I never bought any of his company's stocks. Straight dumpster fire. I'm sure all this volatility is useful to some people here, but truly I couldn't care less about this clown he's an edgy Bill Gates (complete with genocidal megalomania) to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:40:23'] He never said he would not sell anymore shares, FYI
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 08:45:04'] Musk is a scientist and businessman. He put that poll out for data to make a business decision. When you look at his tweets - that has a different meaning than what is assumed by media in that point of view.Frankly the whole Biden administration snubbing Tesla who has been spearheading green tech made me nervous about Tesla in the short term. So any buying of Tesla at all time highs had higher risk and was in gambling territory than the whole Twitter deal.From a business perspective - privatizing Twitter may be a good idea. Personally with the rise of TikTok - that illustrates the big tech and media companies in the west have been managing their money poorly in a time they should be doing the opposite.The whole fact checking A) has already lead to deaths from Covid [don’t wear masks/wear masks]. People like to point at politicians/journalist but with social media I’d trust a random scientist over a politician/journalist.If musk does what I think he’s going to do I’d jump in as soon as I see any flicker that he will do that at a good price. For now just watching media companies burn not just Twitter. Looking at the ones with lots of leverage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 08:28:52'] He had to know that people wanted him out. At the moment he's the villain of all time to the left, so he knew they'd be voting hard against him. He's probably got someone coming in who's even more of a ballbuster. That way he can tell them all, see, I'm not really so bad. Maybe do it with a smirk to make it even more painful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:35:31'] His quitting Twitter won't necessarily help Tesla. I hope he gets bounced from Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:50:07'] He’s made an absolute mess of twitter. He should definitely step down!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 08:21:57'] Information is knowledge. Knowledge is power. Just as Trump is hated for stopping rocket man from blowing up the world. Elon is hated for exposing fascism with FBI and twitter. He would not put this poll up unless he had some idea of the outcome. Meta is at fire sale prices. I am sure somebody on twitter somewhere posted misinformation so he could go after millions of people. $1billion a pop, the new standard from Alex Jones verdict. I am sure he has plans.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:09:14'] Hey Elon...Here is your next poll...&#x200B;Should I just stop being a twat and disappear off the face of the Earth?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:06:12'] It's funny to see people trying to figure this guy out. If you have any mentally ill family members, you would know that it's pointless to use your logic on their actions.  Elon is a massive bi-polar twat. He's manic for a few days then depressed for another few. Look at Kanye. That's bi-polar with paranoia and anger. These fucks would be getting fired from the 7-11 except they had some genius mix with luck to end up where they are. But they are still fucking mentally ill.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 20:46:39'] Elon knew he would not stay on long as Twitter CEO for long. His intent has always been to hire a CEO who shares his philosophy. He has stated so publicly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:27:38'] If you day yes your account will be deleted
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:10:34'] Spoiler alert: his ego is too massive to step down
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 06:54:50'] I think he is going to make Lex Fridman the puppet CEO of Twitter. If he's creating a poll, he already knows the outcome and has planned something for it. Lex had earlier tweeted that he can temporarily take control of Twitter and Elon kind of agreed.He does not want to lose control of his milking cow $TSLA. And for that he has to remain the CEO of Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-17 09:19:52'] It means Tesla will be added on Dec 31st to s & p 500. Meaning every s and p mutual fund will have to add Tesla to the portfolio. Meaning a free $42 Billion dollars for Tesla. Meaning a shit ton of money reinvested into the company. Meaning bigger profits.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:37:59'] Not enough diversification? My brother, you don’t even have a full stock!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:29:10'] Assuming this isn’t a joke. You are extremely over diversified. You don’t need the liquidity names like SPY and QQQ give you. Find a low cost etf you like and just stick with it. Try SCHB if you want whole shares and VTI or VOO if you don’t care about fractionals. If you still want some growth, once you’ve started a position in one of the above consider allocating 10% to QQQM a low cost version of QQQ.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:26:25'] College? VOO and SCHD is all you need. Keep putting whatever you can spare into those and let dividends be your friend. It’ll be well diversified
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:31:13'] Don't listen to the haters here about the total value of your portfolio - (most) everyone starts with a small amount.  That being said - I'd pick a low cost ETF (VTI or VOO) and make it a habit to contribute regularly.  Good on you for starting investing at such a young age.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:27:16'] Too much diversification. Pick ~3-4 securities to invest in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:43:17'] I believe Spy, qqq, vgt all have a quite heavy tech focus. You're spreading money across different funds but may not be diversifying across economic sectors. Not sure what sort of "diversification" you're looking for. Something like SCHD might give you more sector diversity plus some trickle dividends.I'm def not an expert just someone who will probably lose all their money in the market like the rest of us 😅.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:16:34'] You should be more focused on your income. How much money do you have in the bank? Is this your total net worth?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:31:29'] QQQ is top 100, SPY is 504 top market cap.You have plenty of diversification as posted here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 13:49:32'] It’s probably better if you just save up and buy one full stock every once in a while instead of fractions of a whole lot here and there. But that’s just my two cents. I usually save like couple hundred every once in a while and just buy like $500-$600 worth of a few stocks every 2-3 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 22:04:29'] If you’re interested in diversification because of your risk aversion,  plenty of good advice here like low cost etf instead of fractional shares. However, there’s another way of thinking about diversification - which is adding a bit more risk. While I think options are completely wrong to deal with at this point in time for you as well as with this amount of capital, I do strongly suggest to learn a bit more about valuation trying to find good value plays that can maybe-probably-not-but-just-maybe beat the market significantly. If you take the time to learn, you can feel safer diversifying into more risky assets a portion of your portfolio. Even 20$ (20% risk) invested in a decent company that is now somewhat distressed but can get out of it, and which is currently trading at few dollars can create wonders to your overall return.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:32:53'] You have a total of $100 split between 8 different stocks and you want more diversification? O man. I would just sell it all and buy a share or 2 of google. If it goes down more buy more. Dca.

If it breaks below the 180 I'd expect it to go even lower.  All of these have RSI below 50 but haven't yet moved into oversold territory.  Personally I don't hold any of these positions (yet) as they all have momentum to go lower.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-24 20:35:58'] Tesla just acquired the certification to start producing the made in China Model 3s. They still don’t have the certification to sell them though. They’ve recently sent out emails telling customers that deliveries will start soon so they must be certain that they’ll receive the certification soon.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-24 22:56:07'] I live in Shanghai. Lots of Teslas around. In my residence alone, I'd estimate that north of 5% of the cars in our parking are Teslas. Where are those Teslas manufactured? No idea. But they sure are popular.

I can tell you first hand that Tesla options went anywhere from 10-40x off its October Er move.  And I think that this upcoming catalyst is what can catapult tsla to ATH and with the short interest , one can only imagine how fast it could potentially move.

Taking someone else's advice will only give you a reason to blame others for your choices instead of accepting that you made the choice.If you don't know why you own shares in a company, you shouldn't own them. If you do know why, then follow your plan, not someone else's. LPT: Literally no one knows what any stock will do. Anyone that says otherwise is hoping and guessing.

(Vstat chrome extension) Tesla is still the leading electric car maker and is expanding the software of the cars rapidly. \n\nThe robotaxi program looks like it could make tesla a lot of money. People will use the robotaxi system as an excuse to buy a tesla when it rolls out. (People buy because of emotion and justify with logic) So I see the robotaxi leading to more tesla sales and cash flow generation from commissions to tesla. \n\nThis being said, I do agree with most people who say the robotaxi program will likely be delayed and it'll be hard to get the government to allow this. \n\nWhat do you guys think of tesla's current position?"
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 14:49:03'] It all depends on if you believe Elon or not. History has been quite bad regarding his promisses, yet he did kinda convert them to reality somewhen. This is one of the few stocks that could potentially skyrocket over night even at these levels like a biotech stock if they make FSD happen. Until then its just a grind to survive, Model Y could stabilize the company as well as GF3. The only reason why i am comfortable saying this is a clear BUY is because the world and banks will never let tesla fall, even if it goes south with profits from here. There is always enough cash on the sideline to jump right into the ring to help. So christal clear buy from me
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 03:09:40'] Tesla in the eyes of many investors is like a tech stock. Meaning they don’t look at the aspect of the production issues as well as the loan payments that they are continually missing.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 05:17:09'] I feel they are still industry leaders in electric vehicles, especially their batteries. With every other car maker going electric, the gigafactories will always have a steady supply of work. Robotaxis are cool and all but it will take some 5 to 10 years to break into cities and even 20+ years to break the culture of human driven vehicles. I think it's a great long but being at the low right now, I might wait a bit and see if it keeps sinking.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 20:56:51'] Here's the rub.&#x200B;Aside from a few exceptions (Baron Capital, Ark Invest etc), no one gets Tesla or the exponential curves they are riding. History will play this out.  I can't be fucked explaining why but I might do a few in depth YouTube vids to explain someday.&#x200B;Tesla is RIDICULOUSLY cheap now. And I'm going to keep saying so until it's not.&#x200B;I sold a lot of shares in GREAT companies (which have done VERY well for me) last week to buy more Tesla. I increased my position by about 10%. It now comprises 75% of my entire stock portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 00:28:13'] And here I thought it was falling because the demand for Tesla cars was not great which caused earnings to tank

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 06:54:30'] There has been TSLA drama for YEARS. People forget that they survived 2008... Even GM went bankrupt. I think they are a lot more resilient than we have become conditioned to think
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 07:08:30'] > I see this as a great buying opportunity, as demand for tesla cars appear higher than ever.  I think this is a bit misguided as one of the primary concerns with the company for the immediate future is demand.Demand in the US appears to have plateaued. It was sort of hinted at during earnings but excuses were made for why. Not wanting to touch on US Model Y deposit figures was also a MAJOR red flag as they were happy to boast about the 400k+ deposits for the Model 3. That being said, demand is still high across the world. But, again, they simply don't have the network/infrastructure in place to start focusing on this at this time. They tried to dip their toes into international distribution this past quarter and clearly it won't be sustainable with the current setup. Once the Shanghai factory ramps up things will operate much more smooth and demand will be easier to supply. But it still doesn't answer the demand that's coming from other meccas which will require an increase in manufacturing from somewhere...As big of a fan of what they're doing and their overall goal, i'd be a bit weary of going all in on Tesla right now. Outlook over the next year doesn't look so great. Maybe re-examine again early next year.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 08:37:55'] Like others have said, Tesla is dependent on whether or not you think Elon can pull through. I ultimately respect the man for what he's done and what he's trying to do. His over enthusiasm has landed him in hot water with over promises and some missed deadlines, but he believes in his work and strives for consumers happiness rather than the numbers. It's a double edge sword, the numbers all show Tesla has been growing and has been successfully expanding in the long run. The thing is he's growing it at his pace and not the investors. Long term, I don't see the company going anywhere. Even in an economic collapse; they never started an automotive revolution, but they did popularize it. Same could be said with robotaxi and the works. They don't need to be first, I'd rather them be the apple of the car industry, perfecting what others may put out.Here's my bottom line, there was a point in time where Elon had to choose between two companies: SpaceX or Tesla, if he want one to succeed it basically meant pulling the plug on the other and letting it die. He didn't. He chose both, for better or worse. It could've all blown up in his face and left him "penniless", but thankfully for him it worked out. I call that dedication. If the man is so dedicated and has so much faith in his work, then I can overlook all the controversy surrounding him. Missed deadlines do not mean it will never come. Just my two cents. Of course do your own DD.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 14:04:07'] The price to sales has certainly deflated a lot. [https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics](https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics)It's all about whether they can turn a profit quarter. One profit quarter can double the stock given AAPL trades at 2 times the PS.[https://www.grufity.com/stock/AAPL-Apple/Ratio-Metrics](https://www.grufity.com/stock/AAPL-Apple/Ratio-Metrics)Also, seems like the recent news is not very bullish on sales improving a lot too. One thing that should certainly be mentioned is that TSLA is quietly getting more efficiently run as seen by deeper metrics. Inventory Turnover is increasing (which means they cycling through more inventory cycles for same amount of costs). Another way to say it that inventory periods are falling.[https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics](https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics)Assets to Sales ratio is falling. In other words, more sale from same assets. &#x200B;Overall, Things are turning around for sure. Not visible in news yet but visible in internal metrics. However, it is coming out of a big pit and high valuation too. i think below 200 gets really attractive. May be wait a little? Getting there.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 23:53:56'] Tesla is losing money and guided to keep losing money in future. Model 3 was supposed their moneymaker, but after 2 quarters profit, they are already losing money after cutting prices twice. If you ignore robotaxi, how are they supposed to be profitable in the future? If you are buying tsla, you are essentially betting that the 1-2 years of cash left are enough to develop fsd, even though they promised fsd for years and companies with more cash and time didnt succeed yet.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 22:42:17'] You love your bag huh?
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 03:45:16'] Sure demand may be increasing but TSLA’s ability to profit on that demand and the value of the company is restricted by their inability to produce cars at scale to meet that demand. Their earnings missed expectations by miles, and they lose money every car they make. Elon is a marketing God, but I see very little in TSLA that would make me interested in owning the company today. Things that would make me change my mind: A clear path to profitability, manufacturing at scale, a focused business plan or better ability to reconcile the energy business and car business, reduction of debt/cash on the balance sheet, Elon’s focus without the distractions of anime and rocket ships.Edit: typo
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 19:09:25'] TSLA will not reach its potential until Elon leaves or pulls his head out his own ass. Smart guy, but just not the right guy to lead a company

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-29 06:15:51'] Elon is a fraud imo. He was chosen by NASA to try to privatize space to justify billions in taxpayer money for NASA. Tesla has been a disaster, constantly under production, faulty and dangerous and a clear sign to other manufacturers to stay away from the EV market for now while the oil economy continues way past its due date for a couple more decades. Big oil needs to recoup its investments before this age concludes

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 04:51:04'] I’d take some profits now before Elon takes them for you. I just heard from Professor Galloway, that Twitter’s falling revenue may be “barely covering Elon’s interest payments” on his crazy floating rate loan to buy it. The fed is going to raise rates again in a few days, & my guess is the rate hike will be higher than what people think & it’s going to hurt Elon. Falling margins & dropping market share spells out another correction for Tesla stock. I’m sorry but Tesla was always priced for perfection & it simply fumbled one too many times. LMAO!!

Seems like you are new, we all had portfolios that have looked like this at some point which is why it is cute to look back on now.I don’t think you need to go full passive index but for Christ sake load up on an index and make really specific choices for anything else you will buy and only hold a few you follow closely.  Seems like you have just bought every name that retail has piled into at different points throughout the past 3 years, assuming for poor entry prices.Edit: your selection is actually not that bad, I would focus more on concentration if you really want to outperform the index.  It will force you to make higher conviction choices too.I think you won’t see the hidden expense that comes from cognitive/emotional biases.  There is also a cost on the time it takes to manage your positions, not sure that a $100 in tractor supply and lululemon are worth it.  Purge that Roth and pick 5 highest conviction names imo.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 20:07:19'] If you like the company then you can invest $500/week for 6 weeks. Or $500/every other week for 12 weeks. Its called dollar-cost averaging & it is a way to help you leverage fluctuations in the price of a stock over the short term to get the best value for your positions.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 20:45:28'] I don't understand why everyone is suddenly buying right on the inclusion date. There's been gradual growth since the announcement, and all of you people seem to be waiting until the most volatile and dangerous time to make a move. I made some gains on TSLA after the announcement, but I have since been resigned to keeping my hands off and just watching.If I had to participate, I'd buy near market open and hope for the growth -> decline pattern we have seen when other companies join the s&p 500. The problem is that there are always losers, and inclusion date losers are likely gonna lose more than normal. Also, if any company is gonna deviate from the pattern, I'd imagine it's one far from ordinary like TSLA.Hype =/= a good entry point for your position.  It's just hype.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-20 05:58:56'] A lot of people bought just to capitalize on the s&p inclusion  so they will be selling off soon, and that was the $400-550 jump.  The $670-695 spike was index fund buy in end of day trades so that increase will remain because they will hold their shares from now on.  If you see a fairly large drop off buy that dip, but avoid buying near $700 inclusion price in the very near future.  IMO this is a good company and they have a lot of products in the works to expand beyond the automotive industry, and they're not going anywhere soon.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-20 04:29:06'] Don’t invest in Tesla now. The price is too high. It should dip next week.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 19:23:59'] When (not if imo) a correction comes tesla will tank hard... That's when I'll buy
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 19:35:02'] Sell some puts. That way you make the premium and if the stock does go down you will get shares for cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-20 09:17:04'] Buying at all time highs is never advised, but neither is timing the market. If you believe in a company just buy and hold

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 19:29:28'] I don’t know much about investing but buying near the all time high doesn’t seem like a wise idea

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 05:27:50'] the opposite could be true: elon is moving so his new shares purchased and earned won't be under CA tax from the year starting after he completes the move. so he could be planning on going far heavier on stocks. look out bezos!
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 20:15:12'] Lol my guy have you seen the chart? It’s undeniable that this is a bubble. All bubbles pop.    Also executives and large share holders have to file with the SEC and disclose months in advance when they decide to sell. He doesn’t just hop on robinhood and unload lol. It’ll pop, but not because of Elon.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 19:24:13'] Aren’t capital gains from stock sales hit with federal taxes? So it doesn’t matter what state he’s in, he’d pay the same rate.

	COMMENT: ['2020-03-30 06:30:50'] Let the fools keep buying Tesla. These are essentially luxury vehicles while heading in to a recession. Good luck on those numbers 6-12 month out. However shorting a stock with a rabid fanbase doesn't seem like such a good bet to me when there are other deals to be had. Leave it alone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 14:08:25'] Just remember that Blackberry was at the top of its game in 2007. Then look what happened. Dont ever judge based on stock price history. In reality, Tesla has lost 30% EV market share in Europe last years and they also lost 11% in the U.S from ONE other vehicle! On top of that they have only been profitable for one full year...Its ok to loose market share in an expanding market but there's also A LOT of competition coming out in the next 5 years! Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 08:41:21'] I love how people thinks they’re the ones who are rational and ‘real’ investors just because they think everything above a certain P/E ratio is overvalued. P/E ratio without context is meaningless. Why would a P/E ratio of 30 be ‘normal’, that’s just picking an arbitrary number to your liking.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 08:24:17'] A normal PE of 30 does not apply to Tesla. This is why your price target is way off, and why several analysts got it completely wrong.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nTesla ($TSLA) shares are moving lower in premarket Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker delivered the fifth series of price cuts since January.\n\nAccording to the companys website, Tesla slashed prices on the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.\n\nWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC, the company said in a press release.\n\nThe cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the companys internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.\n\nTesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.\n\n**What analysts are saying about price cuts**\n\nWhile Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower pr'

When economic and market pressures depress equity values, negative psychosocial forces ensure they stay depressed as a safety measure! Negative sentiment is a collective "circling of the wagons" during uncertain times. We act as a unit to protect the value of our assets, and minimize damage to our portfolios.\n\nAs financial conditions stabilize, market psychology does not immediately reflect the changing fundamental picture. Negative market sentiment keeps prices honest!\n\nLet others run this defense for you, and take advantage of their noble service.\n\nIn my view, continuing to hold a negative outlook on the equity market for the remainder of 2023 is unfavorable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 18:19:29'] I’d probably go 70% that 10/13 was it, the other 30% being that we started a secular bear market last year.For all the crowing we’ve had over the past several months, for the S&P at least, it was a 6-month bear market and it’s been 7 months sideways since then already. 10/13 didn’t really violate the range…especially considering that the reversal turned out to be legit the next week (10/13 was simply a fake breakdown and tag of the halfback of the post COVID crash rally).If 3700-3750 doesn’t get breached again then you can forget new lows, I’m just not fully sure what can happen on the upside.Now I of course, am stubbornly saying that if it’s a secular bear, it isn’t in the vein of the 1970s, because I in particular have not liked the folks that are LOUD about inflation, but I’m not real sure what would be a catalyst for an acceleration down right now outside of a major reacceleration in inflation occurring.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 15:48:28'] When theres so much confidence that the bottom is in, is a leading indicator that the bottom is definitely not in. You’ll know the bottom is in when nearly everyone believes that that bottom is not in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 17:17:55'] "Once inflation goes above 5%, it has never come back down without the Fed Funds Rate exceeding the CPI”. -  Stanley DruckenmillerWe are seeing more and more headlines about the increasing likelihood of a soft landing and an imminent pause in rate hikes.  The recent rally can be attributed to the economy facing a less severe recession than many have anticipated.  Unfortunately the economy is not the market, and the only thing that matters for the broad market is liquidity. A less severe recession will only further corner the Fed into raising rates higher for longer, as they need a recession to tamp down inflation.  Once you start hearing the term “Goldilocks” thrown around from every dumbass talking head and dimwit analyst, sell your trash and wait for opportunities in the real economy where free cash flow is king.Good luck!

At the same time the elected retards are spending money at record pace. RECORD PACE! But they decreased the deficit by $1 TRILLION.

POST_TEXT: b'As BID draws nearer, I\'ve seen a lot of confusion/ doubt as to what technology TSLA plans to unveil on their big day. This is a great video i\'ve found that puts all these potential innovations into a digestible 30min format. Jordan from The Limiting Factor discusses some of his ideas as to how TSLA plans to scale the production of higher energy density batteries, with longer range/ life. Furthermore, he describes what options he believes TSLA has to scale the production of these batteries into the terrawhat hr per year. Lastly, I\'ve seen many TSLA bulls fail to adequately describe the potential impact of BID beyond "their gonna show off their great battery technology" when TSLA bears ask what advantages they actually have. Hopefully this video from Jordan can show investors what TSLA is up too, along with the evidence to support his claims. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nvideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTFyxbm3Ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTFyxbm3Ew) \n\n(Skip to 27:00 if you wanna hear re'

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-11 06:52:53'] What many beginners don't realize, is that a lot of positivity from battery day is already built into the price. People already expect a lot. So there is a good chance the stock goes down on battery day - even if the news is good. Everyone expects them to announce something like "we can produce more batteries and faster and cheaper". And that's already in the stock price today.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-10 16:19:35'] It's mostly all hype, just like the SP 500 inclusion, and stock split.Every company has innovations, they just don't feel the need to make an entire event about it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-11 04:56:12'] I’m hoping it doesn’t live up to the hype and drops below 300. Not that I think it’ll be bad necessarily, but expectations are so high, I’m hoping it’s riding on people who won’t ever be appeased.

POST_TEXT: b"**OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price & its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4zwua06636na1.jpg?width=2390"
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 16:22:04'] I know one thing, that SPY is reaching oversold territory. Usually when a bounce comes; but this could be more severe if contagion occurs from SVB. $380 next stop. See what happens after!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 18:15:19'] Looks like you had a protective month, 22 win 2 losses is very good.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-12 11:58:07'] I normally include my watch list in the main thread post, but was unable to do so yesterday because I ran out of time going through my chart list.  Either way, here it is; not all encompassing, but the main names I believe will trigger this week.  Based on Thursay & Friday's price action...and the potential for contagion...I will be extra cautious with any new entries.**ABT** \-- long/swing  **ACN** \-- long/swing  **AES** \-- long/swing  **GLD** \-- long/swing  **ORLY** \-- long/swing -- add to existing position  **QID** \-- long/swing -- re-enter  **SCHW** \-- long/swing  **SIRI** \-- long/swingWe will see how the futures open in a couple hours.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 15:58:42'] Keep an eye on Prop. 30 election results in California (state with the most car sales) as an estimated $3bn to $4.5bn would go to zero-emission subsidies and infrastructure. In terms of CPI, the Cleveland Fed is forecasting much higher inflation than current consensus estimates. So another hotter-than-expected CPI result would cause a bloodbath.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 07:46:43'] Elon has a vision of Twitter/ BlueSky becoming the WeChat of the USA.Yes, Elon and Jack Dorsey are working together on this project if you care to check it out..It’s not even 1 week and people are bashing him.. FFS try giving the guy a few months.. Rome wasn’t built in a day.You may be pleasantly surprised..Oh and it looks like a great time to buy 1000 shares of Tesla if you ask me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 17:29:32'] Let’s see.  Most gear heads like ICE cars.  Most gear heads tend to lean Republican.  Most gear heads don’t believe in climate change.  Elon acts like a gear head in his overall attitude towards the world.  Elon eventually alienates non-gear heads.  Is this good for Tesla?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 17:20:49'] Been Selling covered calls for months now and will continue to do so.  If they’re called away at some point, I won’t mind losing the shares. The CEO is increasingly unpredictable and emotional- not good in a public company CEO.  Case in point is entrapping himself into having to buy Twitter (and now running it like a high school newspaper run by a fascist kid).

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 03:56:38'] Free speech seems very expensive if you ask me….22,000 shares and thinking no speech, in fact silence and just the noise of cars, lots of them, rolling off the lines would be most welcome…..
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:01:25'] Tesla will be his #1 focus always, it’s the most important. Preserve the earth we have. Part of the Twitter take over, is an effort to patch up some of the mass communication woes humanity is facing. Tiktok, TIKTOK clocked more traffic that google recently, this is extremely problematic for us as a species.( tick-tock is an aggressively addictive waste of human talent).

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:15:13'] Why would I care about the CPI data on Thursday? It’s a short term problem. How many of you know the CPI numbers from 2 years ago off the top of your head? I doubt any of you do, because it doesn’t matter in the medium to long term. I’d bet the majority of you don’t even know the CPI number from July without looking it upI think Tesla is overvalued and won’t be looking at it until it reaches at least $100
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:34:37'] Sorry I bought lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:48:03'] Elon is an idiot. I mean, clearly he's got some smarts cuz he's figured this much out but he's on a dark path. Who does he think gave him the Billions in subsidies? Obama and Dems, cuz republicans sure didn't do that. Who does he think buys his cars? The republicans supporting the oil industry? No, they're constantly beating down and rejecting federal go green initiatives all over the board. He's making an enemy of the very people who will provide the most for his number one business. Twitter isn't going to make him the richest man in the world that for sure. In fact, it will likely do the opposite even if you exclude the amount of financial resources as he continues to be even more bold with the things he says. Example: this idiot literally told everyone to vote for republicans in house because we have a dem president. If that happens rip mf they're going to cockblock everything you plan to just because it's anti oil.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 07:59:54'] I sold my Tesla stock and bought Rumble 2-3 weeks ago and up $6,000 since then!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 09:08:03'] I don't think it's the CPI that affected the stock, not the most of it at least, but Elon's delirium with Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 09:59:20'] Everyone here understands that in the long term, this is an insane deal. But their short term/temporary emotions about Elon are making the price go down. I'm not complaining, I love seeing the price drop short term like this - I'm buying.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 14:52:08'] Why do you think CPI will affect Tesla?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:43:19'] Maybe the worst looking chart in the S&P.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:57:30'] Man almost like not coming out with a real new design in over half a decade, not addressing their poor build quality, and having a public CEO that seems to be speed running to most unlikable person on the internet is not a recipe for success. Add into the fact that every other manufacturer is now making electric cars and yeah they have some rough waters
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:31:37'] It’s fina drop like a rock
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 22:36:17'] I think it'll probably not move
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 01:08:03'] Am I the only one who thinks this stock has been seriously overvalued? Right now, Tesla makes many more cars than any other company and build quality is actually an issue.  The CEO is distracted. So many other companies already good at quantity production are about to get really good at producing better cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 08:25:52'] Runaway from anything Musk touches going forward if you value profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 09:30:52'] I would never hold that garbage for more than a day.  It’s a dying company with a trash CEO.  It’s only going to continue to plummet down with his media antics over the next 2 years, and legacy automakers are going to take control of the EV market.  Musk and the company had a great opportunity…instead he’s going to be one of the biggest busts in history.  Seeing as how 3/4 of his net worth is in Tesla and now he just got forced bought into a $44 billion dying social network, his net worth dropped by almost half in 1 year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 16:42:25'] Whatever Jim Cramer says, is always the opposite.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 17:36:57'] Not as effective.  Any vaccine allows one to build an immune system.So Dr Jim Cramer is a infectious expert now ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 18:15:27'] So Chinese vaccines work but Western ones don't?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 09:33:21'] no ones work anymore the variants are different
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 10:07:10'] I mean where are these working vaccines
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 16:28:14'] Actually it’s funny he says that. I just read an NIH research article that said the Sinovac vax which uses an attenuated virus has better T cell activity than the mRNA vaccine and upon exposure months later the Sinovac T cells stimulate antibody production that better fights the bivalent virus. So…I guess exposure to the entire virus old school works better than a snippet of the virus. We all knew Cramer was wrong when he opened his mouth though so it’s sorta like stealing candy from a baby
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 13:09:22'] China covid cases for a huge city of 10 million is around a 100 confirm cases.In the US 100 confirm cases is like one NFL game.China wants to get to zero is impossible.They should live it and make sure people are getting their booster shots and mask up.We have seen how quickly they respond to outbreak of cases so they can handle spot outbreaks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 14:45:30'] What’s ‘work’ in this context? I think the combination of the vaccines and their dramatic quarantine rules do a pretty good job
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 02:43:04'] yeah right - but the Pfizer/moderna bullshit did? None of these vaccines did what they were sold for. They even potentially make you sick. Still so many people believed it.Don't even wanna know whats inside the chinese ones...

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 13:50:35'] Wow, the logical paradox here.   Cramer's always wrong but Xi's lying about China's effectiveness but Cramer's always wrong but ....
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 02:29:41'] None of the vaccines have even marginally successful efficacy. The rest of the world is still pretending it works for pharmaceutical profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 15:01:56'] So a country spends billions hoping for a placebo effect?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 15:59:24'] Shit. Cramer might be right about this one

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 15:22:43'] So they work?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 02:42:43'] If Jim says they don't work, I want one. They are probably a super vaccine that will also protect you against all other diseases and give you superpowers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 15:53:55'] Bruh ours dont work either

Tesla is already there.This trend will continue.  Plus crypto will less and less be based on proof of work.   Two trends I do not see changing.   Out of this list the one I like by far the best is Google.  Just has a massive runway to work with built on all their assets yet fully moentized.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 19:00:33'] TSLA and NVDA probably don't belong on this list unless they transform themselves into being much more than what they are now.RIght now I'd consider them similar to Netflix and Facebook: leaders at the time, but not enough moat or diversification to truly stay among the megacaps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 19:13:38'] You misspelled GME 😎

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 12:11:14'] For years, the FAANG fraternity represented big tech players that included Meta Platforms (earlier Facebook) (NASDAQ:META), Apple, Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),   and Google. Wang suggests dropping Meta Platforms and Netflix from the   list and adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia to the group. The analyst’s comments have come amid the underperformance of these mega-cap stocks in 2022. Not only this, the fact that Netflix and Meta   are struggling more than the others to stay relevant to their   stakeholders may have somewhat shaken Wang’s trust, triggering his   suggestion to drop them from the FAANG list.
