	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 08:30:28'] You are just cherry-picking which companies to compare the market cap with. While I agree that Nvidia's market cap is higher than of other chip makers combined, your combination of chip makers is purposely ignoring big chip makers (e.g. TSMC and Samsung who combined have a greater market cap than Nvidia). By your logic, I can just say that the GDP of Somalia (7,293 billion) is higher than that of more than 5 countries combined (Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands). While this argument is true, it fails to take into consideration the difference in size of these countries and purposefully neglects other countries who have a similar GDP to Somalia, thus presenting a distorted image that overinflates the image of Somalia.

POST_TEXT: b'Nvidia graphics cards are at the heart of the hardware that runs AI technology such as ChatGPT and with this increased interest in AI their stocks have shot right up.\n\nRecently I have been seeing some amazing things done with Photoshops new AI features in the beta and with this new obsession with AI I was wondering if anyone thought about jumping in on Adobe stocks because this feature is gonna be widely used in photo editing around the world to be sure and as it gets better even in movie editing. Adobe products are essential in many major businesses already and because of a recent downtrend it could possibly be a good time to invest now before people catch on.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 12:57:46'] No, nvidia is enabling the tech, adobe is a customer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:33:28'] I see that in their cloud business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:13:46'] No. The tech they use will become casual. You might be able to do those things Adobe show casts right now on your phone in the future.For Nvidia, I don't like it either. A lot of the big tech companies are building their own AI chips. There will probably be a big market for Nvidia in the small cap / private sector, I'm just not very optimistic that in the long run it will be big tech clouds.AI tech is moving very fast right now. The next 6 weeks could change what we think right now about it. Maybe someone finds a way to train models super efficiently. Would be great for humanity, bad for some companies...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:34:10'] I think it's the opposite. Google is already implementing AI to edit photos. AI will take graphic design jobs from people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:23:04'] Less designers will be needed = Less users. But for now its a perfect ai hype bet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 18:42:34'] Pretty sure they already have some AI features in photoshop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 21:26:52'] Usually large cap stocks like Adobe gets priced in very quickly when any remotely related news comes out because so many institutions around the world does research on large companies like Adobe and super computers in these institutions buy/sell accordingly.

POST_TEXT: b"Just two days ago, Nvidia dropped a bomb on the AI industry, igniting an already-hot field. Meanwhile, the Fed just signaled the end of a rate-hiking cycle. Together, these factors propelled Nvidia's market value beyond that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, cementing its position as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States.\n\nOvernight, Nvidia's stock rose 2.73% to $271.9, increasing its market value to $671.6 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's A-class shares fell 0.64%, decreasing its market value to $659.1 billion, allowing Nvidia to surpass it in market value. \n\nJust five months ago, it would have been a laughing matter if someone had suggested that Nvidia would surpass Berkshire Hathaway in market value. However, market sentiment has changed, the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies has provided strong support for Nvidia.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 05:08:48'] Here is the paper.   https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433It is worth a read.  Basically they found that switching using 100% optical uses a ton less power.  So instead of converting, switching, and converting back.   Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.It does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.This is a pretty big deal.   Ultimately there is a cost to run large language models like Bard and ChatGPT, etc.     The cost is over 100x of using a traditional search engine that at the core uses Backrub/Page Rank.   This paper is really dated but so much more true today than ever before.  Google was really smart to start preparing for today 8 years ago with the development of the TPUs.  I think this is a place Microsoft has really made a mistake in not doing the same and dependent on Nvidia.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/I do love that Google shares this stuff.  I am retired now and a lot of free time but get a real charge out of learning.  But I think from an investment standpoint Google really should not be so generous.   But I guess they find it is worth it because it helps them attract the best talent.    Top talent want to share things.  I think this is a big reason Apple does so poorly when it comes to AI.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 05:02:00'] There‚Äôs a saying: don‚Äôt fight the fed. The fed is literally telling us to expect more pain and to prepare for it. They‚Äôll likely to raise rates higher which isn‚Äôt good for stocks. I think we‚Äôll have opportunities to buy tech at lower prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 01:31:13'] Nvidia will be a massive winner long term, computer sales and prices are collapsing, you should see the deals at Walmart on older laptop chips. These companies made too many computer chips. Once they sell or destroy all this excess inventory Nvidia will be fine.High end graphics chips and high computer chips aren't going anywhere and the margins these companies can generate when the supply is under control is incredible. If Nvidia dips below $100 I am going to add to my small position, if not I will continue to add Nvidia exposure with the QQQ.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:50:17'] There is a two part answer to this: Short term: you are probably looking at a further decline of anywhere from 15-30%. Interest rate hikes won‚Äôt stop this year so tech stocks will get beaten up. The China export ban is also doing its thing like many others have already pointed out. Long term: computer chips and graphic cards are one of the most important if not the most important component to everything regarding AI as well as everything regarding renewable energies like solar-parks wind-parks. These will be the main drivers of revenue and demand is rising rapidly. Will Nvidia be the market leader? I don‚Äôt know. Will they play an important role? I‚Äòm sure they will. If you are unsure about the trade relations between the US and China maybe have a look into other companies that offer similar products from other countries
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:57:54'] Nvidia is going through a transitory earnings decline, but the company's revenue growth and earnings should recover sooner than later. The company is a solid long-term investment, and the company's stock should be considerably higher several years from now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 07:55:09'] Buying puts or selling short stock on a company with a solid long term outlook like NVDA is a reckless idea.

I'd target a price of $75 by mid 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:51:23'] Probably going lower. Excluding all of the speculation on trading, I'll try to put on display what I see right now. Nv has four main markets: gaming, products for ai computation, professional graphics, virtual currency mining. It made huge profits in the last few years mostly thanks to the mining and ai markets, and used the chip shortage issues to try to establish higher pricing baselines. Now what it got is: currency mining market dipping, and even selling out their former, still current-gen cards. Ai market shrinking as well, with competition coming even from unexpected players such as Google and Aws. Gaming is taking advantage of stocks being sold from mining operations, or waiting for prices to get lower, or for the next gen, or trying out Amd for better value. I can see Nv value stabilising in the long term, but I fear the gold mining rush is over now.

Unfortunately, those have not yet reached full potential and crypto mining is not a hot market anymore either. It's hard to see NVDA returning to previous market cap without delivering either self-driving or artificial intelligence.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 09:01:47'] Probably a lot lower. Crypto mining has changed and other units can be used instead of GPUs. That is gonna keep prices down. Also sales are lagging drastically. Their units are too expensive. $1600 for a top tier GPU is absurd. Only reason we think it‚Äôs normal is because of crypto miners. These cards used to go for 350-500. Even with inflation they shouldn‚Äôt be over 1k. RAM is finally down to reasonable levels and GPUs are next.

On the other hand, as mentioned, we might see flat/slightly up in the short term, but NVDA isn't going to be $250+ for a good 2-3 years at minimum.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 13:22:47'] It‚Äôs going to zero, like businesses, stocks also experience a life cycle. This life cycle is caused by institutional investors. When they start seeing a company do good and their models think it should be worth higher, they buy it up and goes on massive elongated runs since institutions need a long time to complete their buy if their buying billions worth. The stock sky rockets and then once they see something is wrong, they take their massive profits and head on home. The stock plummets and goes nowhere, or goes to zero. Institutions don‚Äôt believe it in anymore and likely they already see new stocks that deserve to be bought instead. So they‚Äôll be moving on. This is called a broken leader, don‚Äôt be an idiot and think your somehow strategically buying a dip of something Wall Street shat in the bin. Your supposed to be buying what Wall Streets buying. I‚Äôll do you guys a big favour and point you all in the right direction. Look up stock stage analysis and buying broken leaders. You‚Äôd see this is exactly what Nvidia is now. Why risk it?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 08:32:35'] Have had a lot of exposure to analysts over the years and can say with confidence: they don't have the inside scoop, and rarely understand - at a level other than "skin deep" - what is going on in any given company. This includes analysts that follow specific companies for a living.  They know how to read financial statements and ask questions that allow them to fill in cell B13 on their Excel models - but often the questions they ask suggest they're focusing in the "wrong" area, while the answers they're given are so lacking in specificity that even if the question was spot-on, it doesn't inform an insightful answer.  Do your own research.  And if you're not willing to go deep on any one company, go broad on many - index funds or mutual funds to spread risk.   And if you do invest in singular companies/stocks just be prepared for the inevitable highs and lows that follow as you try to outsmart the market.  Cramer was also hot on Theranos and we all know how that ended.   No-one, not even it's A-list celebrity board members, knew what the heck was going on....

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 08:25:12'] The Pelosi stuff is problematic for sure- I think politicians should have restrictions on trades they and their families can make similar to bankers, consultants, lawyers etc..That being said, this isn‚Äôt a Nvidia story. All chip stocks are moving higher off of this news, from Tesla to Applied Materials. The run may begin to cool here and begin to either slow or backtrack. The general market conditions remain negative, so hard to keep momentum here imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 09:16:37'] He bought it JUNE 17th not July. It was at 158.80. It dropped to as much as $145.23 and anyone who follows Pelosi's stock buys had plenty of time to buy it before it got back to $158 because he was forced to disclose the sale.That said I agree there needs to be stricter rules about congress and stock buys.Not sure what to do though, the guy is a hedge fund owner.

(+ $1,500 for me today) Fortunately I was able to roll some contracts and make some other adjustments so I think ultimately I should cap my losses below $1k.  RALLIES ARE NOT ALWAY A GOOD THING!!  The news/media makes it sound like bull market and increasing stock prices is good, and decreasing prices and bear markets are bad, and it‚Äôs really annoying  Whether a market is good/bad depends on the individual investor‚Äôs positioning.  In a bear market, when prices are declining then having a negative delta position is statistically favorable, so that‚Äôs why I have that position, so to go in the opposite direction is what‚Äôs bad.I was praying for Jerome Powell to come out and announce an emergency 1,000 bps hike in the fed funds rate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 14:47:16'] He bought call options last year. They were deep in the money. He was down probably around 2 million at expiration, so if he sold the contracts, he‚Äôd realize a 2 million dollar loss. So he paid 2 million more to call the shares away and take possession. There‚Äôs so much to this trade that isn‚Äôt even reported, but if you don‚Äôt understand how options work, then you wouldn‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs underwater on the shares currently.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 18:09:15'] If the price of share moves that much because one person purchases it, then it‚Äôs no good. However, obviously nvidia is the exception in this case.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 06:15:32'] It doesn't take a wizard to see this one. Everyone who wanted a gpu already has one and there is a huge overstock of gpus because no one mines anymore and now Nvidia is stuck with all these orders. They are even going to try and delay their 4000 series launch to compensate but the problem is that few people will be willing to cough up the money for those cards. Don't buy Nvidia now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 07:14:18'] Well, if she sold, we must have hit the bottom. Time to buy NVDA I guess. On a real note, isn't the expected reduction in retail sales already factored into the stock at this point?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:03:57'] Woods is a fraud, but she has a point NVIDIA is overrated. The fact they're supplying GPUs to AI/ML companies was well known beforehand. It's just they used the hype of ChatGPT and OpenAI and just cashed in on the AI buzzword on Q report hype for extra stock riling.Biggest irony is, NVIDIA actually made major advancements in AI themselves well prior to this with their DLSS, which actually should have given them more stock than it initially did, but people were hung up on AMD aggressive pricing and the fact they were on 5nm chipsets and in years of dominance finally someone was catching up to NVIDIA.People are now acting like this is gonna be an revolution, when in reality the hype is gonna die down in 3 months, especially since this is not some co-research AI deal, they are simply selling the product at a good rate to a hyped industry and regardless of all this  NVIDIA will continue growing with a steady trend because it's a good company with strong position overall in a market that will continue needing steady supply of GPUs with growing rates, but acting like this is some AI rocketship that changes the game is ridiculous

If it was purely dependent on fundamentals - the markets would look much different.  If 2022 taught us anything, stock prices have unexplained drops and increases that defy logic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 14:41:42'] Yall realize that NVDA HAS to grow 50% in revenue for 3 years straight just to justify this current price right? To me, I doubt a company at this point in its business cycle can grow like that without major issues with how to scale (big capex cost risks, ask tsla bout it) and just maintaining that level of growth in a product. Its never happened before for a company thats already a top 5 biggest in the world. But we‚Äôllsee. I think its a suckers bet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 13:15:24'] History says the top companies usually aren't the top companies after a few decades. How long Apple remains the top is anyone's guess. But history suggests they will not remain the top forever.

Operators of data centers are revamping to make them better for AI, he said, playing to the strengths of Nvidias chips and software.\n\nDemand for Nvidias chips has been so hot lately that its supply chain has struggled to keep pace.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 01:59:24'] That‚Äôs a 40% increase to $600, give or take, and a big ask. It‚Äôs already up 200% since October.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 09:22:10'] The Puts are pricey.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 05:57:18'] Nvidia is trading at 10x sales. Meaning they would have to pay you every dollar that they make for ten years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:26:41'] There is no corroborating evidence that big tech has placed or will place big orders for chips from anyone. If they excluded multi billion dollar quarterly chip purchases in their own guidance, that would be outrageous. The back end producers such as TSM have likewise not shown any increase in orders, only a decrease. Who is buying the multi billion dollars of chips nvidia claims it‚Äôll sell in this quarter ? Who is building all the chips ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 02:02:51'] Smart cfo. When why did he sell stock right before earnings?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 22:58:01'] So, with Rosenblatt's $600.00 price target for Nvidia, let me say this. Nvidia's PE ratio is lower today than it was before earnings were reported. Over the next ten years, this company will experience rapid growth. Because of their rapid revenue growth, they will reach the $600.00 price target sooner than most expect. As previously stated, they control 80% of the global market. So, from an investment standpoint, this is a buy, which is why roughly two dozen analysts have raised their price targets. As I previously stated, 600.00 will arrive quickly in the coming months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:26:25'] Agreed, at what point do people just give up being wrong? Like ya, eventually it will pull back hard, but in the meantime it‚Äôs ripping higher and bears are only losing money. That must be difficult to cope with tbh

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:43:38'] Blockchain was a technically interesting solution in search of a problem.‚ÄúAI‚Äù such as it currently exists does seem to have some actual straightforward utility. Both have some fanciful pie in the sky hype that is driving a lot of the interest by people who don‚Äôt understand the technology on even a basic level, but blockchain always felt like it was promising future potential with nothing concretely useful in the here and now, where the ‚ÄúAI hype train‚Äù is similarly inflated but at least has some more immediate if modest applications that you can‚Äôt otherwise achieve easily through alternate, existing technology or practices.Edit: Essentially, I think blockchain was in a constant state of ‚ÄúThis is about to blow up once X threshold is reached and will be incredibly valuable.‚Äù But you couldn‚Äôt really do much with it beyond pouring money in and waiting for that threshold to hit that would make it useful for something beyond speculating how useful it would become.All the AI hype is similar except it‚Äôs useful *now* with the hype being around how much *more* useful it will become, rather than when it will start being useful at all. I think people are still getting ahead of themselves a bit and it makes for some great buzz words by people who don‚Äôt know what they are doing, but there is some actual existing value underlying that hype this time, whether it precisely matches the hype or not.

So while tech accounts for the majority of returns they have at other times also pulled the S&P500 down.The other companies are more traditional ones with steady developments.Also bear in mind that a lot of tech companies never issued dividends while the others did also often in bad times. So by investing in the S&P500 you can life of the dividends and benefit from the tech industry's boom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 03:23:21'] Would nvidia has a lot of risk with China/Taiwan issues?  Best wait for nancy pelosi to jump in ;)Also thought on intel? Big drop and may benefit from the chips act
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:52:17'] I own both (400 shares of NVDA and 850 of AMD).  Although I like both, this downturn may continue for awhile. Tomorrow's CPI report is BIG, not only for chip stocks, but the entire market. If that goes "pfffttt," all indices might go to previous bottom or worse . . . Regardless, good move on NVDA's part pre-announcing this bad news. They obviously might have learned from Intel Corp.'s major stumble less than two weeks ago. Specifically, Intel drew questions from analysts on its conference call about why it hadn't issued a warning sooner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 20:07:47'] Still like NVDA more long.  Ai, omniverse, autonomous driving and much more on top of what they already do.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:37:04'] It‚Äôs one bad quarter. People are too short sighted.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:18:05'] From an engineering standpoint, I like the trajectory of AMD's architecture and scalability. Nvidia is doubling down on what they are good at; making monolithic chips. In terms of absolute performance they are the best. In terms of marketing, mindshare, software ecosystem, they are far far ahead of AMD. However, the underlying hardware will eventually reach a bottleneck that everyone in the industry has already started preparing for. Heterogenous computing is an inevitability, and since I see AMD adapting to those right now, I would weight my bets towards AMD. But no doubt in the near term, both are great stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 01:37:17'] Data centre is where it‚Äôs at, I got a feeling 10 years from now owning a giant computer to play games will be the thing of past. Amd and Nvidia for the win.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:16:23'] None if China is serious about Taiwan
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:36:28'] Yes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 08:46:33'] AMD is still the stronger growth bet, XLNX acquisition opens doors to more opportunities than some people realize. Think defense / automotive / edge devices, all of the things Xilinx already makes but now with AMD's SoC specialty (particularly infinity fabric).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 10:22:23'] I think these are different businesses. While yes, both of them have products overlapping, the focus is different. Nvidia is building the entire stack with APIS, software and GPU, so it's the complete pack. If you check the history of Nvidia, they always took bold bets even when the market was going against them. If you check the Cuda product, in 2008, they were still putting in money when the market was soft, so I admire that about them.AMD is betting on the zen architecture, that's firing on all cylinders now and it's targeting literally everything with pc, embedded, data centres and many more things. They don't care about the entire stack right now with software and API. They do have their APIS but not as good as Nvidia.So if you take advanced projects, you will notice engineers only use Cuda and that only works with Nvidia's gpu so the ecosystem is amazing just like Apple.i have covered this in my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlw94i1TZ9Q&themeRefresh=1&ab\_channel=Stockado
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 12:13:45'] Preferably both, any of them but Intel
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 14:10:45'] For me, it's definitely AMD. Earning know out of the park, but I don't think Nidia is in trouble either. Just personal opionion
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 19:47:36'] AMD short term for sure.  Only big chip maker to beat top/bottom and give good guidance.  They aren‚Äôt as exposed to the big gaming/crypto downturn.  NVDA still a higher P/E.  I think long term NVDA will always have an edge.  Short term, 3 month call, I would take AMD

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:17:01'] Lol TA with the robinhood line chart
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:06:01'] That's not a head and shoulders. First of all TA requires candles, because the wicks and bodies are just as important.This is what you're looking at on the monthly: Also your "monthly" is just the last month. You're looking at daily price still.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/)On the daily this is called a tower.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/)It could signal reversal, but it could just be a pause and more upward.Tech Analysis is more about target price and risk management than about predicting direction. How much risk does it have to do the opposite of what you think, and how much reward could be expected if it does what you think.Bulkowski's patterns are very good for their target pricing. Most patterns are 50/50 on which direction they go, and they have 4 ways of getting there.1. Go your way2. Go against you.3. Go your way but then bust and reverse direction4. Go against you then bust and go your way.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/)This gap is a significant problem for bulls, gaps are usually filled. Traders know this. So they won't be buying. Only stooges buy something that gaps like this which is why the stock stalled. Retail is buying, traders are out, institutions likely aren't involved.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/)On a 4 hour this is a triple bottom. I am short AAPL for similar reasons. NVDA was more irrational because of the gap so I played AAPL instead.NVDA will likely fail the triple bottom and fill the gap. That's the trade I'd play if I weren't already playing it in AAPL and I'm also short SPY.I'm also long TLT and GLD so there's a bit of "counter trend" in my portfolio already so no need to go for NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:10:52'] A couple more comments.Even if what you identified were a head and shoulders, which it isn't....* Rule of thumb, all head and shoulders are EXTREMELY well structured. When you actually see them there's no doubt about them. What you marked is a "jumbled mess".The head and shoulders was invalidated by today's trading.The neckline can't be broken. The neckline would be where the vallies are making the lowest lows of the head and shoulders.The peaks that make the shoulders have to be a certain height above the neckline - I forget what as it's generally irrelevant.As I said before:* TA is hardly predictive, it gives guidelines on how much risk to reward and that's useful enough.* But TA itself is usually a 50/50 crapshoot on where it goes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:10:28'] TA is not really appreciated here. Everything people say about it is correct. It predicts nothing. It merely provides a statistical model. If used properly, it can help tilt probabilities in your favor, which over time may be enough to provide a profitable strategy.That said, one could make a case for H&S pattern on NVDA 30-minute chart, but it's far from perfect. The left shoulder lasts only one day, the head two days, the right shoulder 5 days long so far.If NVDA closes below the earnings gap 366.35 for more than a day or two then it can start to get dicey. Until then, this is not a stock I would short. It has huge institutional support, despite the fact that it is grossly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:17:40'] On the weekly this green arrow shows the prior All time high which is also the half-back of the move seen in the yellow box.A halfback occurs when one-time framing is halted which is 2 consecutive trading candles below the top bar (not wick) of the one-time frame.I don't want to explain it more...just note that the halfback matches the prior all time high test.This is strong correlation to at least that much pull back.https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iy6m9IEH/
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:23:11'] This year almost every head and shoulders pattern catches as the neckline and then drifts into a bull flag and breaks out. But if today was first blood on tech stocks then ya good enough. It‚Äôs sort of a rounding top or island top. (Overall look for that massive daily gap to fill at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:50:31'] If I owned it, I‚Äôd put a stop below the support. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it.  If I had some fundamental reason to buy, I‚Äôd use the same stop. I don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôll go, but it isn‚Äôt trending up currently. If it made a move below a short may work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 21:33:09'] It's impossible to do TA on the chart you provided, but just keep in mind that smart money sell into strength. As price moves up they sell. Retail does the exact opposite, they sell as the price moves down.This is how the institutional money buy low and sell high, while retail buy high and sell low.

POST_TEXT: b'NVIDIA ($NVDA) is now trading at 37 times its revenue (P/S) and 202 times its earnings (P/E)! Now\'s the right time to remember what Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems told Bloomberg just after the dot-com collapse\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5h1nfnqf43b1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0eef2d03b6c7889ba6c50b2a152d16333849d9e\n\nCall it irony or foreshadowing, Sun Microsystem\'s campaign was "We put the dot in dot com". At its peak in 2000, the company was valued at $200 billion. By 2001, the stock price had dropped by 80% and Oracle bought Sun for $7B in 2010. A 96% drop from its peak valuation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q2llffuf43b1.png?width=440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf074215982610ff6a69de3d07e2431c3d12bd59\n\nIf history is any guide, buying growth stocks that trade at 10x sales provides significantly lower returns than the broad market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vyqg6r2vf43b1.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e4bcdaee9d91924619fcab2eb517d7936f9b'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 19:59:15'] today they announced on CNBC that NVDA is a buy, sounds like pump and dump to me
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 14:53:11'] NVIDIA hysteria is peaking soon, then the pain will come later.  It always does.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 21:35:11'] The argument of course is NVDA can increase revenues.Their recent statement came out and said that they expected significantly higher revenues.The difference between Sun and NVDA is NVDA has the market. They have a tonne of orders in for their product and they are way ahead of the competition in a massively growing field.Ive seen big funds calulating that at future earnings in 5 years time their current P/E is 1.5. So if the P/E held they would make a lot of money on NVDA at the se prices.Add to this NVDA is decoupled from the company ita a bet on AI at this point. Just like BTC and block chain. BTC didnt do anything that wasnt done better by something else. But it was the embodiment of investing in block chain technology.In saying all that I am not buying NVDA at the current price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 21:25:07'] Good economic sense
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 23:48:03'] Maybe they tapped into AI more than just tech but biotechnology, who know what they really make. Some of these companies I'm my the back of my mind are like Star Industries or damn LutorCorp, who know what they really make or do anymore. Or maybe that's just me

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 23:10:25'] I believe Sun was run by a stern Indian with asperger. Nvidia is run by an Asian who is friendly and charming.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 02:41:15'] "NVDA is overvalued, you should buy value stocks" isn't a good argument. Mostly because cheap stocks in relations to assets and earnings are in businesses where returns on capital are low, and it requires selling them for new cheap stocks once they've appreciated. It can be done, but I'd much rather be part of a business with good economics that can be held for a longer period of time. Fun fact - the S&P growth and value index have very similar revenue growth rates. Growth has outperformed for a decade because it has vastly higher returns on capital. They are better businesses because they require less investment to grow, even if the growth is slow.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:32:28'] "significant time periods in which you will underperform the market (e.g. 2010-2021)."Yeah, and that correlates with money printing. In case of abundant cheap money fundamentals don't matter, only speculation, hype and moonshots. I think the market is still in this mindset, and either 1) there will be a rude awakening and realisation that money is no longer that cheap, and reality still matters (if Fed follows through with what they say) or 2) We're back to money printing, hype bonanza, and even more inequality

I'm assuming the worst that 400m is shaved off revenue. I'm assuming that operating expenses will be less because of the ban and am taking a percentage of revenue approach.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 05:13:08'] Last I checked we still live in a global economy. If China can't get the chips directly from Nvidia then through triangulation with another country they will be able to get them. So the revenue doesn't disappear it may just get delayed for a quarter as supply chains absorbed the new ruling.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 12:09:30'] Why does no one ever consider the fact that NVDA and AMD are chip designers while Intel is a designer and manufacturer when they make these comparisons? IMO the manufacturers are going to be the ones benefiting the most from this chip shortage bc any additional supply they can produce will be gobbled up by the market. Meanwhile, NVDA and AMD can design as many chips as they want but still need to wait on manufacturers. A better comparison would be between Intel and TSM.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 09:37:27'] I think you make a lot of good points however, I have to disagree with ruling Intel out. You seem to have a good understanding of these companies what they do, how they make money, etc. And it is totally correct that AMD and NVDA will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than Intel, but I think it is very important to also consider the price you are paying for a stock. At the end of the day a good company can still be priced too high to buy into with any real margin of safety and in my opinion that is the case with both AMD and NVDA. Personally I like discounted free cashflow to determine fair value and if analyst's estimates for revenues over the next 5-10 years are even remotely accurate (which they usually are) AMD and NVDA both look to be trading at much higher prices than what I calculate their intrinsic values to be. Intel is around or a bit below its fair value depending on what numbers you use, but of course there are reasons it is being valued much lower than the other two.tldr; IMHO (strictly my humble opinion and in NO WAY financial advice): AMD and NVDA are trading too far above intrinsic value to be good buys, and of course even if Intel's stock price looks attractive if you do not like their business prospects for the coming years it may not be a good buy either so I guess I didn't really help you at all lol

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 13:36:03'] Intel is still King for sure and while they don't have anything flashy like AMD or NVDA. They easily outclass them where it matters most, net profits.Safest investment -- INTLHighest % for bigger profits short to medium term -- NVDAAMD is in the middle trying to compete with INTL in chips and NVDA in GPU's and losing on both ends. The markets are so huge though it doesn't matter. All three of these companies will only get bigger as more of the world turns to gaming, pc's and electronics. You really can't go wrong with either three.

Nvidia and amd are going to be good for growth but Intel will provide you with a nice dividend you can reinvest.Also check out Broadcom, Taiwan semi, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, etc. Marvel is a good chip manufacturer and parts company that would make a great addition too.I would wait for these stocks to decline a bit more before purchasing though. If you‚Äôre only choosing one then my vote is for Intel. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 12:11:55'] Agree to disagree about ruling out Intel.A point to note - AMD and Nvidia rely heavily on TSMC for their chips. (AMD is TSMC's 2nd largest customer)Intel will create chips for their GPU in TSMC factories. I am not sure Intel even thought about it but having TSMC produce chips for their GPU reduces the amount of chips they can produce for Nvidia and AMD.At the same time Intel can continue producing their own chips for other things (they don't rely on them in CPU as opposed to AMD).TSMC is a major bottleneck for both of these companies while not so much for Intel. What good is quality when you can't build it. Just look at the shortage that Nvidia experienced after they launched their 3070.&#x200B;Intel is also opening a brand new market for themselves in the gaming GPU market with Alchemist rumored to be released Q1 (Laptop) and Q2 (Desktop) of 2022. On top of that Battlemage is rumored to remain with TSMC chips and to go down to 4/5nm chips.This is of course on top of them moving into vehicle chips and offering to produce much smaller chips for cars.&#x200B;My money is definitely on Intel long.&#x200B;Also, you might want to look into Analog Devices (ADI). It is an interesting chip company, but not in the same markets as these three.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 12:32:05'] I highly disagree that Intel is out of the race. Q earnings look one way but if you look at the annual earnings NVDA has the most inflated PE, followed by AMD and then INTC. I do give you AMD that it has a better ROA, as well as Net Margin. But Intel made 77B in revenue, while NVD made 16B and AMD 9B. Intel is still way ahead for AMD to catch up. Intel also has a new facility in the works. Intel is definitely still in the market and has plenty of room to make mistake.AMD does have a good ROA which gives it potential to take more market space.I‚Äôd say AMD will surpass NVDA but not INTC.Lets see how well this comment ages!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 22:09:51'] My only concern is that you do not really break down the main technological offerings of either Intel or AMD. This may be something that you assume we know and just leave it out for simplicity sake, but a technology company needs to be analyzed by its technology.Investors made a similar mistake to the one listed above over the last five years in Intel. Investors rely solely on the financials and ignore the underlying technologies of the business. Some things that should be considered are:1. TSMC is generations ahead of Intel in manufacturing processes2. Intel's main direct competitors use TSMC3. Intel and AMD utilize x86 chip architecture which is at a disadvantage in lower power devices such as laptops when compared to x64 ARM chips4. Intel's offerings are technologically inferior to AMD and Nvidia's offerings in datacenters5. IDM 2.0 is a massive financial risk for Intel and is utilizing billions in capital investment a yearI think there is much more qualitative research that would need to be conducted to definitively make a conclusion on these businesses

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 20:58:55'] Hey Man, good stuff. I‚Äôm curious, how did you pick these stocks? Did you do fundamental analysis on them? Or is it hearsay from friends/family/social media. If you did fundamental analysis and believe these stocks are good to hold for long term, then by all means. Just a bit concentrated on Tech, as already mentioned in here. It would be not wise to give any advice on specific stuff without more background. Suitability is a crucial part of fin services so take internet advice with a grain of salt. I‚Äôd first suggest you do a risk assessment prior to investing. Buying stocks without knowing your objectives and risk profile is like taking medications without a diagnosis, just unsuitable. Here‚Äôs a link for that. [Schwab assessment](https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-778947/)From there, you get some suggestions on typical asset allocations based on your risk profile. Then you diversify away as you go. ETFs are a great diversification tool, ETNs or Bond funds for Fixed Income exposure if you need it, etc. Soros has a famous quote: "If investing is entertaining, if you‚Äôre having fun, you‚Äôre probably not making any money. Good investing is boring."Set up some good funds, with good returns and decent expense ratios, practice dollar cost averaging on them, and let compound interest do its magic. In the meantime, read Benjamin Graham‚Äôs Intelligent Investor and if you like valuation, read Security Analysis. Best of luck young man, and tread carefully.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 08:12:48'] Comparing R&D costs of leading US tech cos. (by market cap)    Few key things that stand out for me:    1) Amazon spends more money on R&D, than Google and Apple combined    2) Meta is investing heavily in R&D, likely driven by Zuck's Metaverse bet    3) Tesla's R&D expense, as % of revenue, does not line up with other major tech cos. (not sure how it compares to other auto cos.)    If you like this, you can find more charts / data stories like this in my [newsletter](https://www.trendlinehq.com/).    Source: Macrotrends    Tools: Google Slides and Vizzlo

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:20:12'] How is R&D defined? Do some of these brands just lump general staff costs in with R&D? Like is a programmer patching bugs R&D? How about customer support?I‚Äôm just having a hard time wrapping my head around how much they are spending. I get that they are in many markets but that‚Äôs still absolutely insane.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 14:59:31'] Apple so low because they haven‚Äôt come out with anything new since Steve passed away.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 08:28:11'] Worth noting.Just because someone spends more does not mean one is more effective than another. Good general indicator, but there‚Äôs no proof that Amazon or anyone else is spending efficiently.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 14:22:05'] This is horribly misunderstood.  R&D includes research, yes.  But also, and usually mostly development.  So the cost to build data centers, engineering and facility salaries, capital expenses are all baked into ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù costs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 20:11:50'] What is Amazon's R&D?    1) for that amount of cash: well its a lot of different things.    2) Amazon exists in many different areas from streaming video, retail, video games, video game broadcasting, movie making, and their real money maker: Cloud Computing.  3) Amazon's most recent R&D 'failure' was the alexa program that it was shutting down/scaling back. - that could largely mean they have pushed it to the limits of what they can expect to get out of it.  - I doubt alexa enabled devices are going away anytime soon.  4) Back to cloud computing - Amazon built its own warehouses to cut out a middle man. half my amazon packages this week arrived from UPS and half from Amazon's delivery fleet (cutting out a middle man).  When it comes to cloud computing:  There are any number of AI services from security, chat bots, targeted advertising, etc that Amazon maybe paying another company to do for them that eventually they can do for themselves and continue to vertically integrate.    Amazon does a lot of things, it is going to continue to try to do more things, innovate and integrate them into its package of services.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 21:16:07'] Wtf is meta doing?They have nothing to show for that massive r&d
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 22:52:06'] Neat chart, so Tesla is more like a car company than the others.Amazon is the largest cloud provider and has to spend like mad to stay ahead, so that seems reasonable.  And comparable companies spend a similar amount compared to revenue, so they won‚Äôt catch up unless Amazon messes up.NVidia is purely leading edge semiconductor with less services revenue, so relative R&D will be extreme.And who knows what Meta is doing.  From a shareholder side it is hopefully on psychology research / abuse tactics.  And not just bad meta verse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 23:53:02'] How much of Amazon‚Äôs R&D goes to RIVN?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 00:55:44'] Why isn‚Äôt Intel on here? $17 billion on R&D annually, 20% of revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 03:09:54'] Amazon has many companies and brands‚Ä¶ and is much bigger by revenue so makes sense. Meta with runaway spending by billion is the worrisome number

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 05:47:45'] R&D must mean Rings of power & Drone delivery.Because Amazon is known for burning obscene amounts of money on things that ultimately never take off or were bad ideas from the start.Remember they spent 60 mill an episode on  show that no one is talking about a month after the fact. And realistically no one bought Amazon prime to watch it. They burning money. But they're lying about it and hiding the expenses with creative accounting

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 06:57:42'] I'd like to think that companies prioritizing R&D have more potential for future growth so this is a bullish stat.Here's a bull put spread for AMZN if you also have an optimistic outlook.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 13:32:45'] yeah right, the same way that FTX spent on their "lab"? irs should look into this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 17:24:18'] Kind of concerned that Tesla is not doing more R&D considering that they are a pioneer leading the field.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 20:12:45'] That‚Äôs why they not improving any more. Tesla just selling their old product and expect people to buy it. :) sooner or later more advanced and developed cars will take over them. Hyundai is a good example , rnd is important.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 10:02:04'] I sold numerous times over the last several years. I stopped messing with it once it got over $300. Though I regret it, I still think the stock is an inflated bubble.I have no clue how some people get some of these projections. NVDA needs serious growth to reach the value that people are anticipating, which it is doing. Though, I don't know how long it can continue it's projected growth. By investing in NVDA, you are investing in the fact that they stay at the forefront of developing chips for gaming, AI, cloud computing, and crypto mining - and that such markets continue to grow significantly.NVDAs dividends are at a minor 0.10% yield right now. All investors are investing in is the hope of selling it at a higher price in the future, or one day they start paying serious dividends. Paying a decent dividend would require their earnings to significantly grow. The P/E ratio is insane. For significant growth, the P/E ratio either needs to continue climbing to insane heights from all the optimism, or the company somehow expand their market presence, which is hard considering they are at the forefront of it.I love NVDA, it was my first investment, bought at $53 per share. I've missed out on some serious financial gain because I've sold it a few years back. It has been one of the fastest growing stocks for a while now. Though, that growth seems to be mostly in it's P/E ratio. Whether you hold/buy/sell is up to you, just know that there is a lot of optimism riding it's current price.Currently, there are better soltions to crypto currency mining than GPUs, but the price for the alternative solutions are much higher. If competition prices were to drop, NVDA could face some losses. GPU prices have also significantly increased, and many are on back order. I'm curious if GPU prices will drop soon, and if new chip manufacturers will rise up to compete with NVDA because of all the silicone chip growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 15:11:29'] investing in companies like Spotify/Doordash/Uber only makes sense if you think those companies will pay a dividend once they peak in growthMy theory is they are run by tech autocrats that will dilute the stock for all its worth to drum up cash once they realize they don‚Äôt have a moat. But they‚Äôll use you as long investor to pay for their executive salaries.You need more companies that are ‚Äútraditional‚Äù. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with boring cyclicals. They tend to look out for their shareholders and either maintain stable growth or pay dividends. A well run cardboard manufacturing company or toilet paper company is less likely to lose 60% of their value compared to a tech start up that hasn‚Äôt made a profit in three years even though they earn hundreds of billions in revenue.

It has the potential to 10x in the next decade and it would expose you to the financial sector. STNE would be another speculative financial stock.With your age I believe these two would merit a small allocation risk vs growth. Adding a decent amount of MA or V is also good idea if you want less risk for a long term hold.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 14:48:37'] Hey man, so some feedback. You were unlucky with timing and bought the highs, it happens. There is a lesson to be learned here - you chased tech and growth and acted on impulse. Now, that same impulse is pulling you the other way telling you to sell the lows. That impulse feeling you get, either way is seldom right and you will benefit from learning to control it. In regards to the losses I‚Äôm unsure if you can harvest a loss in germany tax wise? If so that would be a thing to do regarding some of the really big ones here depending on size. Over time, a few solid stocks and a larger position in an index fund will get you money, especially now in a bearish market. This is where you buy heavy and safe.Prioritize fcf, read in on the business before you invest - meta for example and microsoft are good stocks, with solid cashflow and surrounding businesses, spot on the other hand is unprofitable. PLTR is unprofitable and diluted to kingdom come.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 16:53:20'] Everyone saying you need to diversify out of tech: that really depends on your time horizon. The beta in your basket of stocks is high so expect it to go up and down a lot. But in the long run you have a lot of high growth potential. If you don‚Äôt like seeing it go down or ever feel the urge to sell when it goes down, diversifying would be a good idea. Otherwise strap in and enjoy the ride. I personally like to try to find disrupters to industries with really reliable customers (crsp to chronic illness treatment, run&fcel to energy production) as well as under appreciated  markets (crwd and panw to cyber security, Amat and Lcrx to chips produced in America). I think these have massive long term potential. My time horizon is greater than 20years and I think these companies/sectors will outperform considerably, so this is my get rich fund.Separately, in my tax advantages accounts like my Roth and my 401k, I tolerate a lot less risk so those are mostly S&P500ETFs and some international large cap ETFs. Generally still bullish with a long time horizon so I‚Äôm not too worried about hedging with bonds or anything like that. That‚Äôs a bridge I‚Äôll cross when I‚Äôm within five years of my desired retirement. At that point I‚Äôll be concerned of the downside, and diversify into bonds, reets, dividends, etc. This is the money I expect to pay the bills when I‚Äôm old. This and Realestate are going to be the most effective tools for ensuring a comfortable existence and a decently young retirement age.

Are you trying to make money by investing in tech growth stocks, did your research and are convinced theses will do it for you in 10 years when you plan to sell? Then right on, that‚Äôs the way. If you plan to save for Rente then I‚Äòd suggest very much to diversify and get out of the more risky stocks. Buy some boring companies Allianz, M√ºnchner R√ºck, JNJ, Pepsi, Cola, Home Depot, Mercedes, Visa you get the idea. We are German man! Use the German buy some boring high dividend DAX companies üòÑüá©üá™But then again if you don‚Äôt care about dividends and retirement and hope to make cash by selling those in 10 years you‚Äôll probably be fine (although I didn‚Äôt research your companies besides MSFT) Other than that some ETFs won‚Äôt hurt, I do pick stocks as well but I have some Sparplan for broad index ETF with dividend payout.

The rest in cash and don‚Äôt use margin.‚ÄúKapitalerhalt‚Äù sollte einen groesseren Stellenwert bekommen als ‚ÄúWertzuwachs‚Äù. Yes, takes longer, but it‚Äôs safer in the long run.

I don't follow the news on them, never see them. So I'd suggest not investing in a USA stock just because you can, stick to things you know, use, see regularly.Unless you use CRM or PLTR in some way, you probably don't understand it. That always makes for riskier investing.Future cash flows for META and SPOT are not a given, and those companies may fail long term. Chips are down, though not as down as this past summer. So those are fine. Now is not the time to buy high-flying spec stocks like PLTR, but grab quality stocks at a discount. Save the cheap spec for later. It'll still be cheap compared to, for example, MSFT or GOOGL.Too much tech. At very least, add some healthcare, some medical devices, some biotech. ETFs preferred. XLV, XBI, IHI.Don't fret selling at a loss, when moving into better holdings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 00:33:18'] I recommend saving about 10k, and then going to a reputable investment bank and let them invest your money for you in a diverse portfolio.

Not saying it‚Äôs impossible to invest by yourself and end up positive but a qualified financial advisor will set you up for the long-term and they understand this stuff way deeper than most of us.

Also aside from Microsoft, I don‚Äôt think any of those pay dividends. I would think about us there a company you could buy that pays a qualified dividend.

I personally don't subscribe to the you'll be fine if you hold over the "long term" or dollar cost average on the way down. Thst is all financial service industry narratives to keep them rich and take your money.  What if you are over age 50?  What if your stocks go to zero?IMO, The better question to ask yourself is: "Why do I want to be exposed to double digit negative returns month after month that are literally destroying my savings?".

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 12:20:13'] Too heavily weighted in Technology stocks.  This sector is high risk and high reward.  Technology companies need to constantly innovate to stay relevant.  At least one of those companies will likely not exist in ten years.  You may get lucky and another will make up for it.  They do have a large moat which is good, but biggest gains for these stocks is behind them. They aren‚Äôt likely to see the same huge gain going forward. I would add more lower risk stocks to your portfolio.

POST_TEXT: b"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 16:16:26'] You got lucky.If we could consistently time the market we would be billionaires.You likely won't learn from this lesson, so when you fall on your face after trying to time the market, come back and let's talk dollar cost averaging.With 20% inflation I am guessing you are living in a non-eurozone country (europe is far too general) - so you can at least protect yourself by holding euro or dollar currency/assets vs your native currency.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 17:02:32'] I timed the market right by going all in back in the 2007 bottom. I think that experience has cost me money since I always thought I could repeat it. The problem is, you stay out of the market too long as it goes up and when the correction does eventually happen, it‚Äôs not deep enough to get you back to where it started. Stay 95-98% invested for the long run in a diversified portfolio and leave yourself a small percentage to gamble with and scratch that itch.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 18:49:16'] Unfortunately, strongly disagree. Buying AMD here is high risk low reward. Did you look at their last earnings report? Revenues slowing, margins down and guidance is not so strong. It was a buy in the $60s, sell in the $90s. The AI hype is still very speculative and one negative catalyst will send both NVDA and AMD tumbling down. The price run up has had nothing to do with company fundamentals, so I would be cautious here.

Am I wrong for thinking the thing would GO UP prior to a split?  I suspect a post-split dip but with all the positive reporting lately, what in the san-hell is happening? And, I would think with earning coming shortly thereafter, this thing would be red-hot.

Software incudes **Omniverse** (Nvidia\'s version of the metaverse in ProViz segment) and **Enterprise AI,** targeting vertical industries within the Data Center segment.

Yes, I get the concerns over the Metaverse spending and TikTok breaking their monopoly apart, but unless it's going to die in the next few years, the valuation seems really on the low side.I would love for Zuckerberg to come out tonight with a halt to the metaverse cash bleed and a huge buyback plan to retire 10% of shares within the next year.

In fact, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way for almost anyone to go about investing. The simple thing to do which is highly highly effective is to invest in the broad market with low cost etfs or mutual funds unless or until you feel like you are an expert investor. The broad market represents the aggregate estimated long term value of all stocks by expert investors. Ask yourself what you know about McDonalds that expert investors and the market as a whole doesn‚Äôt know or what information or insight you have which the market also has but refuses to act on? If you don‚Äôt have a very good answer to that, you should not be investing in individual stocks at all. If you want to become an expert, there are a lot of books you can read about investing generally. You can research factor investing and value investing etc. But until you have done enough research to consider yourself an expert that can confidently discuss your investing philosophy, stay in broad market funds. Something like the SP500, the total US Stock Market, or the total world stock market.

POST_TEXT: b'Stock: Nvidia\n\nTicker: $NVDA\n\n**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** \n\nTo begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\n\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\n\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billio'
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 21:34:57'] The Ev/Ebida I found was 21x so Nvda is WAY overvalued.Also Nvda hit over $225 since split which is over $900 presplit beating the old ath.I would love to own Nvda after it drops 20% plus.It is 3x its pre- covid price and 4.5x it's covid bottom.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 23:04:00'] Look at PEG it's simpler and summarizing metric. NVDA is already expensive and with the current instability in the market I would not buy but I'd hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 01:22:31'] Risk for Nvidia at the moment is the ARM deal. Nvidia faces opposition from the EU as concessions made do not go far enough to mitigate damage to rivals
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 05:35:16'] This is like reading something you‚Äôd hand in for high school. And you don‚Äôt mention the ARM deal which could totally make or break the momentum forward. You do however mention crypto miners as GPU purchasers but you miss mentioning AI development which is expected to become NVIDIAs and the worlds most important tech this decade.And key ratios are available at every financial site in the world, there is no need to spend half your analysis focusing on one of them and base your whole thesis on it. End of the day only cash flows matter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 05:53:21'] I have found that investors who follow a discipline, even a bad one, tend to do better than those who react to any market reversal.  Pick the tools that best fit your risk profile and ignore the rest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 10:47:07'] The only criticism I can give is the fact you said ‚ÄúI can see Nvidia moving in two different ways‚Ä¶‚Äù, In the stock market world this means nothing because there are only two ways a stock can move.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 02:04:39'] semiconductor industry is cyclical. The GPUs that have been sold in the past year might end up in the used card markets and hurt the sale of new cards in 2023 and 2024. Ether mining with GPU is not going to be profitable forever. The current price assumes that Nvidia is going to have exponential growth for several years. See what happened in 2018 to NVDA.  But the company is good and the CEO is a literal stable genius so I would say this is a good long term investment. I personally would not buy at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 13:12:49'] I will be watching Nvidia very closely in the premarket to see what smart money thinks of this. With this purchase, they are consolidating a lot of influence and power.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 23:15:23'] I remember in an interview masayoshi son said that he believed ARM would one day be worth more than google. Maybe he just miscalculate, which is hard to believe for a deal that he paid billions for, but why would he want to sell the company now?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 13:12:07'] It depends on how much the deal is in stock.Nvidia shares are priced richly. If they do most of it for stock, it's a good deal.But I don't think it will matter much.Their market cap is $300 billion right now. More than Intel and AMD combined. What's another $40 billion?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 19:43:21'] This is not good for the industry.  nVidia has a rough track record working with other companies in the chip space.  Nothing about them says they'll be a good steward of ARM.  Hope I'm wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 23:10:24'] A lot of server side chips are Intel based.  But ARM adoption may be signaling a shift. As networking professionals adopt mobile and laptop devices with ARM chips, it will increasingly make sense to interconnect them with other ARM devices. This sounds like a good move for Nvidia.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-13 08:19:16'] NVDA had a huge run-up when the deal was being discussed and still tentative.  It's hard to tell how much of that was just general tech bullishness and how much could be attributed to the ARM acquisition effect. But ARM chatter didn't send them down in any way before. Would be interesting to see what it does pre-market tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-13 01:43:17'] Don‚Äôt focus so much on the deal.  I think the fact they are exploring this option is a positive indicator the Nvidia is sealing to expand horizontally and offer additional products and services to spur growth.Look at their comeback and track them up to this point.  They have had really good leadership and excellent products driving the company back from the brink of bankruptcy.  They are expanding horizontally to expand their product line to drive future growth in other growing business sectors.  They, along with every tech company, are overvalued at the moment, but long term they appear to be a good pick up once the market shakes out and if their stock falls a bit. Market cap is way too high to be sustainable.

Not a peep from her relating to anything related to the Fed. No, when everything was going up it was because she was the smartest person in the room. Now though, it‚Äôs open letters to the Fed, interviews, opinion pieces, etc. and not in a single one of those has she acknowledged or even hinted at the fact that maybe it was just luck. That she benefitted immensely from the market being infatuated with tech names. Not any innate ability, just pure happenstance and luck. So she blames the Fed, the government, other governments, regulation, the war, covid, etc. Realistically though, she‚Äôs a fund manager, she should be monitoring the risk of her portfolio.  She obviously didn‚Äôt understand the potential risk inherit with her strategy and now she‚Äôs paying the price (well with others money of course).

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:57:14'] Why not just invest in an index like SPY that is tech heavy? I respectfully doubt you will outperform the SPY in the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:45:36'] Step 1) Buy stock in non-tech sectors
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 20:19:11'] If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.The 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.The Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.One portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).Well diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.Here is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\_analysis:sector\_rotation\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)Notice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.That portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.Best of luck.going forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:41:12'] Just my opinion and not financial advice. Apple, Alphabet, NVDA, AMD, and Tesla are 57-58%Palantir, Coinbase, and Roblox is your high risk stuff 8%I would Use your 10% cash to add to SCHD which are high dividend stocks that hedge against bear markets like 2022. Some of the stocks in SCHD include Costco, Pepsi, Merck, Amgen, Cisco, Blackrock. Then you got 4% in WMT already.So then your portfolio becomes 57% tech, 20% s&p500, 15% SCHD and WMT, 8% high risk stuff Yes out of cash but then either sell the high risk stuff that hasn‚Äôt worked or id chop some apple or Google

POST_TEXT: b'NVDA and GOOG/GOOGL are both amongst the top 10 market capped stocks in the American sp500. They also are both more or less are tech sector. Theyre similar in these regards. NVDA did a stock split when their base 1 share price got around 850ish 7 for 1 split. NVDA has outperformed GOOGL on a harder rally YTD, in part due to second leg up shortly after a share split. Its no secret the modern stock market is going through records options activity as well as record amounts of retail buying in. More liquid stock as well as cheaper stock price via split can alleviate the cost of writing 1 options contract since options are inherently a contract regarding 100 shares of the underlying security. I honestly think the split has helped NVDA rally since retail investors who liked NVDA now had access to cheaper option contracts through stock corporate action. My question is then, what are the advantages of having a rather expensive share that could be thousands of dollars per share? What are the '
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 13:14:31'] Institutional investors (II) do not want companies to split their shares.  Works differently internationally but when II‚Äôs trade in the US they pay around 2-3c per share in commissions when they trade with brokers.  The lower the share price, the more shares they have to trade, the higher the commission per trade.  Fun fact.  The average share price of a S&P 500 stock was in $39.29 in 2006.  Today it‚Äôs around $194.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 14:17:28'] If a company is thinking they might want to issue new shares to raise money, or they want to spend shares on an acquisition, or a get a good valuation for a merger, they want their stock to be affordable to retail investors.If a company has a bottomless war chest, then they only care about the big institutional investors, who prefer a higher price as /u/hltrading explains.Google can pay cash for an acquisition. NVDA "only" has 20B cash on hand, having a higher stock capitalization in the short term is potentially more useful to them. But it also can mean more volatility in a downturn. Also they're trying to push their omniverse thing, and the bigger they look the better for that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 13:00:56'] There is no advantage either way. It‚Äôs purely psychological. Before ‚Äúretail‚Äù traders could purchase fractions of a share, the idea was that splitting the stock lowered the ‚Äúprice‚Äù and let ma and pa trader feel like they could afford to purchase it. That instead of spending $1,000 on one share of stock, a 10 for 1 split lowered the cost to $100 bucks. But again, you can buy reactions of a share so it is pointless.

Only index funds.* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.These three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent.

With a single company divulging inside (non-public) information it hurts those that invest with that single company while this person or family prosper. With lawmakers they directly approve regulations that make or break businesses. They do so with entire industries. This is done at the detriment to all taxpayers for the benefit of the same single person or family. Their vote is not public information. It may be known or assumed. But essentially private.No individual stocks should be allowed for purpose and all traded should be restricted to C-suite restrictions. Filed far in advance. Etc. etc.

Him commenting on what should be legal or not should be considered with the same credulity as Chris Hemsworth commenting on the validity of a Viking artifact. 2. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs wrong, just that he‚Äôs not an expert or the end all be all opinion on things. 3. Nancy Pelosi didn‚Äôt make these buys. Her husband, who was doing pretty well in funds before she got elected, did. If you think they‚Äôre getting together each night to compare notes and strategize, I‚Äôd invite you to consider how much time you think either of them have. 4. The evidence of corruption isn‚Äôt the act- it‚Äôs the uniqueness of the act. If everyone was buying the stock, then everyone was buying the stock. If he was the *only* one buying the stock, then it‚Äôs suspicious. But what we have here is someone who is only famous because they were portrayed in a movie making an accusation without much supporting evidence against a person who is only known because of their spouse. And you all are using that to defend the the things you already believe- which is the definition of confirmation bias.

Funny how insider trading USED to be illegal for congress and when republicans held the house, senate and presidency they exempted congress from those laws.     I wonder how many republicans profited off of knowing that bill wouild pass?       I don't see anyone talking about them.   And while we are at it, lets examine ALL of the insider trading done by EVERYONE in BOTH houses of congress asn see if we can't find a way to get them subject to the law again

What isn't available to the masses is whether or not we are approaching a market bottom or are looking at a further 10 to 20% drop. Pelosi has the ability to take the loss as well as wait it out.  As far as paying them more, no.  When they retire, they get to keep their unspent war chest, as well as cushy book deals, speaker circuit, and highly paid positions in private sector because of their connections, not their knowledge.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 10:20:19'] He is saying that buyers are going to start picking value stocks that have been beaten down. I hope he is right. I remember in 2000 this was called ‚Äúa flight to quality‚Äù. Selling companies with junk debt, buying companies with strong cash flow that can easily service any debt they have. There are some very good companies with strong cash flows that will be minimally impacted by a recession that are at historically low p/e ratios because they have fallen with the market. Basically total bargains. The smart money is going to start snapping these up soon, while we continue to see ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks further decline.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:03:10'] The problem with this guy is, when he is finally right, once every 15 years or so he feels the need to vomit every thought in his head. All of this is negated when the fed changes gears and he looks like an idiot for the next 15 years because he doesn‚Äôt understand monetary policy, the durability of the dollar or the power of the fed. He hasn‚Äôt understood any of this for the last 15 years and is the reason why he‚Äôs been wrong until the fed took a hawkish stance. Sure, if the fed continues to raise rates a lot of companies will go under or get bigger haircuts but the second inflation gets under control they will start cutting rates and most likely start QE again and this guy won‚Äôt understand why any of the companies he‚Äôs short on start recovering. TLDR; He‚Äôs right for now but doesn‚Äôt know why.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 11:02:18'] My views is the downward correction is far from over. Smart money is using smooth brain retail to facilitate their exit. Market looks like it's at a bottom. They throw some of their big cash in to pump it. This causes fomo from the smooth brains. Which causes the pump to go even higher. Then big money rug pulls. They pull back the money they use for the little pump plus all the money poured in by the retail. Resulting in New lows. My opinion this will continue until all new heads are cut out of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-04 03:12:46'] Nvidia is (one of) the most important tech companies out there.They have the strongest consumer graphics card and that's all nice and well,but more importantly they do a lot of AI tech and Cloud Computing.While the market adjusted yesterday (after alot of hype around Nvidia), in the long run it can only go up,atleast until some signficant change in the company or their working fields (which probably would take years to decades).
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 15:38:26'] I'm new to NVDA. I was able to free up some cash and purchased some shares just a few weeks ago when it was $500. Today its trading $570s! I'm planning on holding this because of the possibility of acquiring ARM and further growth in its data center business. I would suggest looking for reports and info on that side of its operations. ARM acquisition would be a catalyst for a gap up.But, this stock has risen so sharply that a pull back is probably due (whenever THE pull back occurs). I may try and swing trade this if I am able to. Regardless, I agree this seems like a good long hold stock with room for definite growth.

However, I'm the doofus telling you it's actually the technical factors, and all these lamo-s are lost. I think there is a false notion that tech is very safe as an industry. * * *The same thing used to be thought of a lot of the commodities, and then it was thought of real estate, and then it was thought of financials, and then real estate again, and then motor vehicles, and then it was kinda all up in the air for a while, **but** now we have the tech industry that is a "safe bet no matter what"--sort of cloud9 honeypot stock sector. I heard guys telling folks to split 50/25/25 on sector etfs, NVDA, AND this week. That's a really scary sign considering we haven't seen tech respond to much sector wide negative news yet, such as if Intel's 10nm process isn't a possibility, or if AMD EPYC chips don't actually do anything, or if Nvidia just *doesn't have* a lineup for after the 10xx series. I'm not saying there aren't other good manufacturers, and I'm not saying that we should all drink the Jonestown punch just because they did something weird around earnings--after an infinite green stretch. I'm just noting that there could be other factors, but I am not worried about it, NVDA will keep on keepin on. * * *[Here is an investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp) article  describing the differences in technical factors, fundamental factors, and market sentiment.

And there will be more prereleases, if not just due to negative currency impacts (like MSFT in Q2). $COST provides monthly sales updates, so unless margins dropped significantly or they got stuck with excess summer inventory, likely not much surprise there.

The American public needs to stop voting for elected policy makers who do not support that legislation. When AOC AND Matt Gaetz come together on something, there is nothing more clear about what needs to be done (they also came together on legalizing marijuana...it's a very good gauge).

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-14 19:47:01'] I believe that's their move the ARM architecture is better in many ways and catching up in computing power where x86 dominated.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-14 22:40:13'] the long term risk is RISC V
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-14 22:30:35'] I'll be the first to admit that I don't know enough about this to comment, but here I am commenting. Personally I own NVDA, AMD, and INTC. Mostly NVDA though.Mostly in INTC because they're so undervalued (IMO) but I def love AMD and NVDA. Def stuff I want to be holding in 5-10 yrs time.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-15 03:06:08'] It has been argued that as a result of the Trump administration's anti-competitive stance, selling to a US company will make ARM worth less than it is now, ultimately leaving a hole in the balance sheet Nvidia. There is a movement to actively move away from the US semiconductor industry. Any country outside of the US that develops a superior semiconductor will most probably cannibalize the US semiconductor industry to death.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 06:16:20'] Crypto mining for the most part is dead. Just an FYI. I do however think video games will continue to grow at a scary rate 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 06:58:39'] I invested in NVDA about one and half years ago, mainly because of the future of VR, AI and self-driving vehicles. Now the crash of crypto-currency drags down the price, but I still believe it is a great investment in the long run.Speaking of when to invest, it is extremely hard to time the market and buy at the absolute low price. That being said, you should fill your positions gradually. The price is 50% off from ATH, you can purchase 5%, and if it drops lower, then purchase another 5%
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 08:25:38'] Everyone is saying crypto mining is dying, and I agree, but in my opinion nvdia is the future of ai and machine learning. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 05:00:42'] I'd say wait for a dip down to the low 100's, put a stop loss on for 85, then let it ride. Everyone thinks that BTC is the end all be all but AI is the goal I think. Everything ive read points to NVDA going back to the 180-190 range by this time next year. Honestly, I wouldn't risk more than 3% on any position. I don't hold anything for more than a month though.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 09:03:01'] Invest in increments and and average your cost over the next few months. Don‚Äôt splurge all 20k at onceIt‚Äôs good to invest, even in an uncertain market like right now, just don‚Äôt go all in at once.NVDA is probably going to maintain its leadership position in AI so it looks like a good investment to me, as well.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 09:37:09'] Don't buy it all at once, buy it over time so that you aren't trying to pick the bottom.The amount is really up to you, do you want all your eggs in Nividia or do you want to spread out the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 07:05:31'] I‚Äôd wait until the macro environment stabilized. Look for the S&P 500 to trade at a TTM PE of 17 or lower. That would be an indicator that the market has returned to historically normal conditions. I like NVDA too, but I‚Äôm concerned about picking a stock when the macro environment seems poised for a pull back.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 11:55:58'] I recently took a big loss on NVDA. Bought high (260) and kept buying on the way down trying to average down, but the bottom never came and I lost almost a third...and then the earnings report hit and I lost another third. Like you, I believe in the company and think their fundamentals are strong now and for the future. This is why I bought the stock in the first place. However you must realize that only three years ago it was trading at $20, so now that their "bubble burst" what's to stop it from falling back to double digits? This stock had a wild run and you and I were too late to the party.I got out, took a lesson-learning loss and will buy back in when I feel they've bottomed out and have a clear direction. I'm in the same boat as you now and I'm waiting.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 15:59:47'] Buy in double digits
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 18:10:19'] I think the market was largely centered around enterprise as well as gaming. Crypto was mostly focused around ASIC mining anyways. There is increasing competition from AMD with very comparable high-end cards at a competitive price. &#x200B;The whole market should continue growing together at a fast pace given the multiple industries that rely on GPU. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 18:26:12'] why not just write a long dated put at the strike price you'd be willing to buy NVDA at? 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 04:08:07'] 1. Best time was 2 years ago. You missed the push it got from crypto mining.2. I personally wouldn't put more than 10 and less than 5% of my budget in one single asset.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 05:28:04'] Don't FOMO into this shit. It's a fake pump and dump by Citron right now. NVDA should be in the low 100s given its last ER and projected future. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 08:24:36'] Is $20k all you have to invest?  Or all you have to invest in stocks?  If it's all you have, I'd look at ETFs or mutual funds and don't put it all in at once.  If for just stocks, a good rule of thumb would be to own 4 to 5 stocks max, and make sure they are in different industries.  You wouldn't want AMD and NVDA for example.   Also in this climate, I probably wouldn't do it all at once.  Maybe 2.5k now, and 2.5k six months from now.  
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 07:42:11'] I was looking at it but the ease at which others can make their own units is scary. Google is making their own TPUs. Tesla their own ASICs (?). Keep in mind nvda is still rather high pe.Search for it on Reddit, there have been lots of talks on it in the past week.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 08:28:07'] Nvidia is more than just graphics cards. but for the life of me i just cant understand why people would drop $1300  on a graphics card to put in a computer worth $700 tops.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 09:58:56'] If all you have is $20k, you invest that entire $20K,  what is your plan if it drops? I would not make a single purchase of Nvidia. Plop $20k on Nvidia. Instead, buy similar to the way you purchase into your 401K and buy small chunks over the course of time. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-21 04:12:49'] If you believe in the stock and want to put money into it, you should look into technical analysis to give you an idea "when" to buy it. Check out tradingview and finviz.Also, if I remember well, you shouldn't put more than 5-10% of your overall portfolio value in order to diversify. However, if you want to go all out, I'd say 10k and put the rest elsewhere. Good luck!

But when you only have 1 share isn‚Äôt there times when it makes more sense to get more value. I can never get a straight answer. I held my one share of NVDA for a year until TSLA dropped to $400 and I decided to sell 1 NVDA and got 1 TSLA and 2 AMD. Besides NVDA paying dividends, since it was only one share and not 10 or something,  I have 3 of other strong companies with growth potential. Like does it matter when you have so few shares or would I have been smarter holding NVDA regardless? Also I‚Äôm a long term holder. I buy with no intentions to sell.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:48'] Yeah.  Warren Buffett‚Äôs point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    If you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you‚Äôd obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.  Most people can‚Äôt and, as a practical matter, don‚Äôt really have the time for any of this.

	COMMENT: ['2017-12-27 08:21:15'] AI is starting to become big in ed-tech. I think Google could make a big splash if they acquired one of the start-ups in this space. It's interesting because Google has core software (Google Admin Console) which is practically mandatory for schools that use Google chromebooks in the classroom, but they don't have a secondary filtering/data/analytics software. Secondary software is extremely expensive (my district pays close to $100k a year for it), but absolutely necessary. I'm surprised that Google hasn't made a move here yet - it's a major software market where they already have a strangle-hold. They could have the trifecta: Google devices, Google device management software, Google filtering/reporting software.

Leaving iff what you think are the riskiest segments of if the S&P reduces diversification and increases risk, although probably not by a lot. Buying individual sticks and concentrating in tech adds quite a lot of risk.It is impossible to say which strategy will outperform over the next year, but you are taking on more risk, not reducing risk. If you wanted to reduce risk you could buy index funds for markets other than the S&P

(looking at yield around 4.5%+) and put the other half into canned food and shotgun stocks... ie the consumer stocks that have resisted deflation...  which is to say military or supportive contracts as defense will get funded in the spending bill regardless.. and people need to eat.. so, food or related non deflationary defensive.. just don't overpay for these, look for bargains in the red candle moments. as for me, I feel I'm ok with letting my stocks ride since I have more than a 1 year window on retirement and fairly confident no company will file bankruptcy.. what one DOES also look for if your horizon is long term is, answering the fundamental question, are ANY positions that you hold going to be dogs with fleas.. under-performing the market for an EXTENDED period of time, losing you money?? if so, drop those pretty fast... basically holdings without dividends can be your worst nightmare if they remain depressed for a long time and a significant chunk of the market is, well.. just that.. in good times, the herd will pull things forward, in bad times they fall off a cliff, but you don't know where the edge is. BTW, if you've been in the market for a LOOONG time, look at your stocks objectively, in a big pullback some stocks will be worth ADDING to, vs losing money on as the multiple gets chopped in half sorta thing. For example.. I bought some Chevron and Exon when they were in the toilet with negative oil price... fundamentally were these companies going bankrupt with everybody still driving? No.. now they are 2.5x that buy in price.

POST_TEXT: b'Heated debate going on right now on whether or not nvidia has lost it 2 yr long mojo. Does it have room to run up after this steep sell off or was that drop justified. I personally have never seen a big tech stock miss guidance by that much and now find it a bit hard to trust management after the misleading gaming and crypto revenue numbers came out. \n\nShould a wise investor wait or jump back in monday?'
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-18 17:20:42'] I am keeping my long positions for 10+ years but it sure hurts.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-18 16:44:51'] Crypto mining isn‚Äôt profitable anymore. This will cause a flood of cards to enter the market. It will also cause new cards to be used only for graphics. This brings down the price of cards.Memory will have issues next year. Prices will continue to go up for that which could impact gpus. I think nvidia still has the competitive edge with raytracing but it‚Äôs not enough for the company to bounce back to these high levels we saw this year. I‚Äôm out for now but I support them. I think the market is going to further correct next year with the tariffs. So basically I‚Äôm all liquid assets right now.Secrethobo has spoken.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-18 19:47:23'] Every software company is starting to heavily rely on machine learning. Machine learning doesn't run on potatoes, nvidia doesn't need crypto. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-18 17:31:10'] I'm honestly surprised the die down from the crypto boom took this long to finally get to the chipmakers. Us PC builders are thankful to be able to get cards at proper prices again. That being said NVDA and AMD are going to return to their original business models before all this nonsense. The long game in chipmakers in that regard has not changed. The drop in price to proper valuation however will reflect that. If you bought on the highs of the Bitcoin speculation it may be many many a year before prices bounce back at true value to those levels.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-11 08:40:17'] You're thinking the right way.  However, realize that everyone has the same speculation, and by that logic it likely is "priced into" the stock already.  The market as a whole right now is quite expensive vs historical prices as well.  My put is if you really like a company, buy it ONLY if you could keep holding even if the market turned south, and even keep adding money to it to average down.  Think wanting to hold for 5+ years minimum.  If you can't or don't think you can do that, buy some S&P500 which will be less volatile, or a blend of domestic and international stocks with bonds which will be further less volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-11 20:39:32'] Sure NVDA is a good company.  Just don't freak out and sell when it dips to $400 or something.  If you're going to buy here because you believe in the company, if you see it drop 20-30% based on no real bad news, you need to be prepared to buy more.  The general hype for the company goes far beyond the next round of video cards, and things like that are generally priced in already.

I was expecting the two lists to be very different but still surprised to see how big the difference is. Few companies stood to the test of time, expect Microsoft and likes of Exxon from 2000. Many big companies in 2022 are no where near the top in 2000. But in general it appears that consumers and tech are the two main sectors where most companies are from.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 02:16:39'] Wait until 10 years from now.  The mega tech companies will be a LOT larger.   People just do not get that companies like Google have barely even got started.Google just has a massive runway to work with to keep double digit growth for at least another decade.Take a simple one.  Android is the most popular operating system in the world and passed Windows years ago.Yet Google does not charge a cent.   There is well ove a billion devices activated a year.  Just a coupld of dollars per device would add billions to Google's bottom line as no new material expense.The thing that is really going to accelerate their growth is AI.   Watch this video and tell me if you have seen anything more impressive?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdpprICvNIAI is going to completely change the business landscape.    There will be endless things likehttps://blogs.blinx.ai/predicting-3d-models-for-protein-structure-using-ais-deep-learning-software/But NOT just Google.   All of the mega four will be a lot larger.  Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.  Each one has at least one deep moat if not multiple moats.

Any price under $200 is a great buying opportunity in my opinion, but it‚Äôs not for short term investors. If you buy NVDIA hold it for years, it will pay off.

As the new year hits im seeing it go back up. Im holding my shares for now. Im currently losing a few bucks a share but they are solid and I admire there business as a whole. They are extremely volatile which scares me but i think after the new year things will turn around. With the Volta GPU coming out i can see this as a huge positive whether cryptos take to it or it stays in the gaming realm.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 01:48:53'] 1. Put in a stop loss. This should be done immediately after buying an equity to begin with, whether it‚Äôs a trailing stop, a stop at a previous support, or a previous 2 day low, etc. After your stop gets triggered, re-enter at the next push up. You can even make this buy automatic with a trailing buy order at like 1% or something if you‚Äôre really too strapped to wait for a good entry point or don‚Äôt have access to your broker. 2. A 10% drop can be hefty, but really isn‚Äôt much for these 3 companies since they‚Äôve been gaining over 20% a month. If you‚Äôre an investor, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. If intraday or swing trading is more your jam, I‚Äôm assuming you have Step 1 as part of your risk management strategy. 3. This can be an opportunity to average down. 4. See step 1.

Not to mention that their biggest cash cow, Facebook, is getting worse and worse as Zuck has lost interest in it. If Zuck announced he's cutting metaverse spending by 75%, and is laying off 20% of the company (as as been suggested by institutional investors), the stock would double in a few weeks. But he has sole control of the company via stock holdings, and he seems to be pursuing the metaverse with an almost religous intensity - like Captain Ahab going after Moby Dick. No thanks.

The surge in demand from the crypto had a big role in their growth past year. Maybe there was a lag on how much it affects the company, combine it with profit taking and today's sell-off, they are due to a little correction.

I have a growth value of $192.71 based on consensus growth estimates of 25% yoy for the next 5 years. The average, which I gues would be fair value of $119.69. Pick your poison.

We could split the difference and say AMD is about 30% undervalued. But regardless of valuation, now it‚Äôs a great time to start a position IMO. Waiting much longer is trying to time the market too precisely. One can add slowly over time in case AMD goes another leg down. LRCX is also a good semi company that‚Äôs reasonably valued.

Now it IS possible as BTC rises, other alt coins rise up along with it, which would make those coins profitable to mine. But I don't think it will cause a rush on GPU's like it did a few years ago.

You need to spend time researching anything and everything you actually purchase.Many brokers give demo accounts and I strongly recommend using it to actually test and see what works well without risking real money.The one thing that I will say that will help you as you develop your trading and begin to really want to explore a live market more thoroughly is look for stocks that provide dividends. You want to be able to focus on when those dividends are paid. Win a stock pays a dividend may or may not be relevant to you based upon what you're trying to achieve with your own trading and investing.Typically speaking, stocks that pay quarterly will pay more each quarter than the stock that pays once a month but that is relative to the time frame of the actual payment. Also each stock pays a different rate compared to another so finding the right ones with the right risk appropriate your situation requires specific levels of research and time to make sure you are thrilled about your research.As far as the amount you purchase, there are really two simple rules that apply to that,1. Never risk more than you can afford to lose,2. Always be willing to lose everything you risk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 16:12:13'] My advice is dont learn on internet strangers to recommend what stocks to buy. Do your own research and due diligence. Read up on how to judge fundamentals, technical analysis, read charts, and trading strategies. If researching individual companies is too much then research index funds like SPY and QQQ, they are vested across the entire market. You need $ to make $, so I would not start with stocks, invest in yourself first.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 16:39:21'] Something worth noting that doesnt show in these charts.Alot of the "gaming" profits come from GPU sales, which are down due to changes in the market (economic declines, Ethereum moving away form mining).  This means more GPU's are being sold for gaming purposes.  Many 3rd party vendors that build GPU's using NVDIA chipsets have voiced dissatisfaction working with them because of their "unprofessional" practice's. Might hurt their sales in that sector considering at least one vendor has elected to stop working with them completely.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 19:45:12'] Tbh, expecting 1000 to turn into 1600 without any knowledge besides randomly picking stocks and reading pump/dump posts is stupid. You are aiming at a 60% increase within a year, it is possible, but not by merely holding stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 20:31:55'] it is hard to make money when the market is going down.  It is even more difficult to make 60% return, in a short time, no matter how the market does.  You are right, don't believe the analyst.  I think at the beginning of the year they (analysts as a whole) were projecting over a 50% return for the market this year and it has a 20%, or so, loss.The best time to get into the market is after a big down year, so your Meta, Amazon, Goog, and Apple could very well return 30 to 70%, maybe more this next year.  Buy equal amounts of all four and you most likely will be up this time next year.  CRM, VFC and SWK are also decent bets for next year.Another important rule is don't invest money in the stock market that you need in less than 5 to 7 years.  So trying to make enough in a short time to purchase a plane ticket is most likely not going to work, more times than not.  Sorry, but the stock market is a slow growth machine.  The most powerful sklow growth machine over time, but slow nonetheless.  Best of luck.

In order for nVidia (or amd for that matter) to grow sa it did through 2017 / 2018, there will need to be another catalyst such as crypto.This being said, I think the next catalyst will be caused by advances in monitors and consoles. Many gamers and general PC users will need faster gpu's to support their builds; and with consoles breaking into Pc esque specs (as best they can; xbox one x for example), PC will continue to advance to outpace and drive memory prices.tl;dr - all about the memory, imo next gen consoles will be the next catalyst for the company

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 08:46:37'] There is really only one reason a company splits its stock, and it‚Äôs because the stock price has gone up substantially, which would almost guarantee they were already outperforming the S&P 500.  I think it‚Äôd be very hard to separate the appreciation driven by the stock split and the appreciation based on fundamentals or other market dynamics.  If you compare companies with similar betas, would the split stock still outperform?What is the retail ownership of these stocks?  I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs more than a few percent at most.  If that‚Äôs the case, I wouldn‚Äôt think a more retail friendly per-share price would have too much of an effect on demand.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 03:37:17'] There is a fair bit of survivorship bias baked into the analysis by filtering it with the current market cap.You could also test it against other commonly known factors, especially momentum to see if there is edge in the strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 04:18:49'] i am surprised you did this, as i think what makes a stock go up, is the underlying business cash generation as it relates to the price.  a company that generates cash consistently, or has good future business prospects and a management team to get the company there, will prosper.  a split in a vacuum is worthless. if you included variables , like were they making money etc, what the PE was when it spilt, interest rats etc.  it may be mire useful
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 06:51:39'] Solid analysis!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 07:04:50'] - thank you for the excellent, interesting and thorough analysis. You have some of the most worthwhile posts on stocks i see on Reddit. It seems like choosing stocks that are going through a split could be functioning as a screen for companies with rapid growth. A couple questions:  why do low priced stocks do a split? There seem to be disadvantages in having share prices too low. ( if it dips afterwards it could end up off the nasdaq(etc) and traded OTC. )To understand why they tend to do very well afterward, it would help to understand that. There is a definite survivor bias here by screening for stocks presently over billion market cap- as someone else pointed out.  How many were eliminated by that? What happens to your data if you don‚Äôt use that criterium? ( include all the stocks that split- or just only analyze splits for companies that were over a billion at the time of the announcement). Thanks

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 05:57:25'] I tend suspect splits, where the object is to make a share price sound better, tend be doomed to failure.Such a thing happened with Natwest bank (RBS) where the 1:10 idea promoted the price to around 1.90 from 19p. Five years later, it still hovers at such a level.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 07:10:03'] Thank you OP for putting this together! Four months ago I was scared of Crypto and decided then that I needed to educate myself.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 07:05:28'] > But it definitely has an edgeThat's because it literally increases the demand for the company stock through the making of options contracts more viable. It's doesn't increase the value of the company really, but it does add to demand which is expected to add to the price. I would be incredibly surprised if there wasn't some kind of increase around stock splits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 15:34:21'] At 16. Start with index funds. I suggest a portfolio consisting of S&P 500 and Small Cap. VOO and VBR.Build a base in index funds/etf's and pick individual stocks later.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 18:22:24'] Mostly good pics but don't buy BABA.  Too much political risk.  Just add to what you have.  Thats good stuff.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 12:53:52'] I would just funnel money into a market cap weighted index fund at your age (VOO and VTI are good options). There is little reason for you to take on the long term risk of picking individual tech companies (the counter argument of course is that you are young and at a period where risk can payoff handsomely). The companies you chose may grow fast in the short term, but you will likely want to consider selling them at some point (50 years is an eternity in tech). Nvidia has been a mega grower, but they also dove hard during the recent crash which means you could get stuck holding them when they lose a large portion of their value if you aren't actively paying attention. An index fund wouldn't require much if any oversight over that time. If you invested just $200 a month until 65 years old then at a 7% return rate you'd have over $1 million. You'll likely be able to afford more than $200 a month as you get older and you'd likely hit higher than 7% returns, so consider that a low estimate. I personally recommend having at least 50% of your total investments in index funds - especially if you aren't 100% sure of what you're doing and can't spend time to research companies on your own.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 14:04:17'] I'd really recommend sticking to a single index fund, either the S&P 500 (SPY or VOO) or a total market fund (VTI).This will make investing easier/safer as you're learning and getting to know what to look for in companies. It is also easier to invest in when you don't have enough funds to buy very much.You buy one share of VOO and you own a slice of 500 of the largest companies divided by their total market value.This removes your exposure to one company going under when you can't own many. It also gives you more time on what to look for to pick individual companies properly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 16:06:21'] Nope!
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 14:36:08'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 16:54:12'] At your investing age I would also suggest getting into ETF‚Äôs as they are the right starting investing vehicle. I suggest 50/30/20 of VOO/SCHD/VBR. Don‚Äôt go with VTI as it is IMO over-rated and has many non-money making mid and small caps. But if you let your portfolio be 50% into ETF‚Äôs and rest into your ‚Äòresearched‚Äô stocks then that way you will learn the market behavior from young age. You have a long road ahead to correct any mistakes in the way. The ETF portion of you portfolio will anyways give you the cushion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 17:49:34'] I would recommend a few ETFs as others have said but in addition to market wide exposure, you should look at some specific types of ETFs as well.  You like tech from the looks of your initial portfolio so I recommend QQQ.  It is more of a tech based ETF with about 40% of the portfolio being Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, and Google.  You mentioned energy and I recommend XLE.  If you want to do more individual stocks, get ahold of some consumer staples stocks that are good investments in most environments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 20:39:28'] I would stay away from Baba. Chinese regulations are dumb.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 12:19:02'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 22:16:09'] I would do VOO and SPY for the s&p 500. QQQ for the nasdeq. Keep holding and buy dips
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 11:55:51'] Buy GME before July 17th stock split
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 17:44:07'] GME and AMC
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 13:14:08'] Those are great picks. One thing I will say though since you‚Äôre low on money is to invest in ETFs and Index funds. They contain 100s of stocks and it allows you to have a hand in a larger pie without the need to seek individual stocks. Some ETFs I‚Äôd recommend would be SPY, VTI, VNQ. However make sure to do your own research
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 13:28:11'] If the company is still going to be around in 20 years its a good pick
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 18:37:46'] When the title said I'm 16 I thought I would hear something up and coming......Buying these anyways......At your age you can probably see the "future" and see trends way before the old guys on Wallstreet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 22:30:41'] Like everyone said, ETFs are the smartest thing you can do. QQQ seems like the most fun. There's multiple comments talking about ETFs, but have you bothered learning what they are or researching the tickers listed?And yeah, good picks - but could I ask what made you buy $goog? it's a phenomenal company but I'm just curious as to what made you personally think thatEdit: also expect to see some rocky times for your portfolio this month. Don't let that discourage you or make you sell. You researched these companies, and believe in their longterm success, so why would you sell just because it's red, right? Just be patient.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 02:27:53'] Definitely try putting some in the spy especially at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 06:08:18'] This is a great foundation for your portfolio. Solid picks! As of your plans on picking Alibaba next, I support you immensely. I've made most of my profits from Chinese growth stocks. Yeah, they are quite "risky" - is what the Wall-Street manipulators want you to know.&#x200B;Alibaba, NIO and Qudian (which has still not jumped yet) are great picks to choose on top of your current investments. REMEMBER - NEVER sell your solid "boomer"-stocks in the greed of profit from growth stocks. There still is a political risk and you may lose money you didn't intend to lose. BEST of luck!
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 06:15:39'] Don‚Äôt bother with energy, low margins and competitive sector. They underperform the market in the long run. They have done well the past 2 years but over the last 10 years the spy has grown almost twice as fast.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-10 19:35:28'] Solid! I would add a few undervalued future winners and the baba pick may be a stretch but who knows I feel a few high dividend picks might do you well also and I feel you failed to prioritize between the google and nvidia maybe dumping those nvidia and moving them into google for fractional shares may do you better it is very undervalued atm and could do you no harm because nvidia isn‚Äôt dividend heavy enough compared to overall price potentially jumping with google

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 08:54:29'] Dump Google and Blackstone. You need cash. But, if you are into diversity, buy dividend stocks that will pay you to own them. Or as young as you are, have those stocks reinvest their dividends into the stocks  you choose for long term. Patience is your best friend.

Whatever is happening right now is incomprehensible and quite frankly dangerous for long term gains. The public sentiment that we have dropped enough and should therefore move up, will work for a short time. Then the fundamentals catch-up with the market and it goes down. The soft landing is not happening. There will be a day when the market just drops 10% and that‚Äôll be the day the Fed pivots. Hope everyone stays safe and profitable.

The consumer is in debt and personal savings are shit. This holiday season maybe last hurrah before the consumer rolls over and all earnings will be shit. This will of course cause massive layoffs and recession. Fed will pivot and the market will head lower.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 20:03:04'] Start preparing your move to a more credible investing platform. RH only let's you move whole shares to another broker. Crypto is another story on RH so make sure you invest with someone else also. Make sure you don't have fractional shares on RH before you sell or they will sell your shares at current price and credit you the money.  Leaving you to reinvest at the current price.  Personally I would recommend looking for another broker soon before getting to much invested with RH. Other than that IMO you are on a great start. Good luck in your future  investments.

Return-on-equity: 20%+ hits it out of the park: divide net earnings (income) by shareholder‚Äôs equity to calculate Hit all 5 and if market cap is not obscene (difficult to find at this time in my opinion), you may be looking at a gem.Best of luck.

Additional tips to consider: 1) keep a stock on a watchlist for a least 3-6 months before building your position 2) determine and entry price & an EXIT price. Too many investor hold on to winners and waste valuable time/return potential elsewhere. 3) avoid short term cap gains at all costs 4) keep a war chest handy for period of Vol. (such as 1Q20) while you can hold cash, you may be better off of a hedged product that still generates return above cash. Maybe look into the Innovator ETFs, Gateway or JPM‚Äôs Hedged Equity Suite. 5) Patience‚Ä¶compounding is truly no joke.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 08:06:52'] Preface: I don't know your risk profile. However, here's a spectrum of options that may prove useful. You don't have the money to diversify with individual stocks. To be properly diversified, you need to buy something that is pre diversified like an ETF. If you want higher returns, your risk will go up significantly.Safe: Buy ETFs that follow indices like SPY. Let them sit for years. Buy ETFs that are value based like Vangaurd hold for years. If interest rates are low, buy a growth based ETF. Sell when interest rates increase. If you want more risk, buy an etf in a particular sector. When doing this, find a way to balance your portfolio across different promising sectors in case one underperforms.Slightly risky: Do the above with ITM options with at least three months to expiry. It's going to provide you essentially the same trade, but it'll do it with leverage. It'll multiply both your losses and gains. You can do the same with margin. Just be sure to use a stop loss to prevent losing your money. Also, learn how options work. If you don't understand options, you can lose your entire position.Risky: Invest in individual stocks. See typical advice for stocks. Normally, it would be slightly risky, but without diversification, there's more variance with them. I recommend a value approach considering the effect that tapering with have on growth stocks. You can try options, but the variance might kill you.Very Risky: Small stocks they provide even more opportunity for growth. These stocks and their options will provide you with potential moonshots, but it is nearly certain that you'll lose your entire position. I would place deep value and meme stocks here.DO NOT DO THIS: DON'T buy penny stocks, illiquid options, communist stocks, deep OTM options, or OTC stocks. If you do this, you are putting yourself at significant risk of loss. You deserve to lose your entire position if you do these.Afterstatement: People may disagree with my assessment, but this is my personal investment philosophy. It works for me. It may not work for you. This is not investment advice and is only to be used for educational purposes. Invest at your own risk after doing your own research.

With that in mind, here‚Äôs what I would say about your portfolio:  it‚Äôs a good mix of stocks overall. I see a problem though: you are buying fractional shares.  Fractional shares .... literally ... are fabricated by your broker. That‚Äôs not good. IMO it‚Äôs better to have fewer companies in the portfolio with whole shares than it is to have more companies with fractional shares.  So I never ever buy fractional shares.Companies don‚Äôt sell fractional shares, middlemen like Robinhood do.   When you buy fractional shares you are just borrowing shares from a middleman.  The middleman keeps your voting rights and you rely on that middleman to be honest that they have not sold fractional shares from a pool they don‚Äôt own.Have you ever seen a company like Robinhood validate that ALL of the fractional shares they sell add up to whole shares?No you haven‚Äôt. Because they‚Äôre not validating that very important fact.With all of the complaints about ‚Äúfake synthetic shares‚Äù on Reddit I‚Äôm surprised nobody calls out fractional shares for what they really are: fake, made up faux fractional shares.

If you want to take on more risk to return ratio you might as well just through a grand in GOOGL or TSLA On the other hand if you are just starting and this is like your first $700 but you will be adding another $700 every 2 weeks or month or whatever the case. Then I mean. This isn't an aweful selection.  Not super risky,  good companies. But you are overlapping the SP500 quite a bit.  If you wanted to not use the hood, I'd recommend Fidelity for an individual broker.  Or for your type of portfolio possibly even M1 finance. Good luck and remember to keep investing steadily and don't be afraid to be more aggressive during market crashes and pull-backs!

The "Blue chips" that have a steady return and dividend.  That's my recommendation at a young age.  I see you have WM, Google, Microsoft, these are all long term buys of critical services that will continue to grow as the population continues to grow.  Keep throwing money at those.*I'm not a financial professional, just some idiot that throws money at the market if/when I can afford it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 11:18:58'] Diversification is a great start, good job. Keep doing this. I do recommend using a platform with better and clearer research, for as you get used to investing the more information available and clear, the better informed decisions you will make. You will likely also figure out which sectors appeal to you personally - those you can intelligently predict based on knowledge gained through research and knowledge you have already. You can always open more than one account, keep this one, open another at a different broker.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 11:19:19'] First, transfer out of robinhood and into a real brokerage such as fidelity if you‚Äôre in the US. Their customer service is fantastic and that‚Äôs super important when it comes to your money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 04:14:42'] I don't own anything out of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ, but I'm not sure I want to buy into semis at this point.They're clearly doing into the down part of their cycle and historically, we've seen values cut by a factor of 5 to 10 from their peak.The other thing to consider is that there may be a glut of capacity coming online over the next few years--when this happens, it could create a price war if all the technology is plus-or-minus about the same.The last thing I'll note is that AMD was in this position before over Intel back in the 2000s. AMD's stock eventually went from $45 to $4. I think this happened twice.Depending on how badly things go, I wouldn't be shocked if we saw AMD go to below $50.

Will it come back? Probably, but not until the current market changes.If you buy now don't be surprised if it continues down for a bit. If the market continues down don't be surprised if it doesn't come back for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-08 14:18:00'] I can't grasp how UVXY bagholders don't see that they saved markets from recession. Because so many of you are still holding UVXY shares; markets will continue to rally. You could easily earn some money back by getting into one of the most profitable trades of this decade, which is shorting UVXY. Selling UVXY calls has been making consistent profit even in 2022!Like, you have to hate yourself and your family for still going long UVXY to this date. You are lighting your money on fire by going long leveraged volatility products.The reason why UVXY keeps dumping is because European Hedge and Pension funds make their livinbg shorting UVXY's entire float. It's the only explanation for UVXY's downwards trend in 2022.You can front run these European Hedge fund algorithms by shorting UVXY and UVIX shares, or selling UVXY calls as SPY is dropping. This is exactly how their algorithms work. You can see it playing out on the charts intraday.TLDR: UVXY bagholders are the reason why markets have already bottomed for 2022. Watch intraday to see the collapse of UVXY due to European Hedge funds algorithmically shorting the entire UVXY float. Sell UVXY calls while SPY falls to front run these algorithms(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)

Not to say that he‚Äôs even doing much at the top these days and would make an actual difference to the share price, but I do think a lot of sellers would take Berkshire Hathaway out of the top 10.Continued consumer good purchasing and expansion to other markets will drive Walmart to the top 10.I think Tesla gets top 7 as well.Here‚Äôs my bullish, biased, hopeful guess: Paypal makes top 10 by 2025.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-30 19:24:27'] It's interesting to note that from 1917 to about 1990 it was basically the same companies that made up the top 10. Which means we could potentially see the FAANG companies staying at the top for another 50+ years. That's such a crazy thought. It's also interesting to see how dominant Exxon and GE were since the 1980s. If you think about it, Tesla is like the modern equivalent of Exxon + GE. I think Tesla could fill that spot, and become the largest company by market cap. I found this [site](https://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-usa-by-market-cap/) that ranks companies by market cap. You can rank by country and category too. Pretty neat if you wanna check it out.

Personally, I won't be looking into a new GPU until my 1070 dies or it won't handle new games.   Now, everyone either own 1070 or 1080s that costed a small loan and now NVDA expect people to put out that much more money again for what, 30% performance boost?

Valuation is based on earnings and growth, not the number of cars produced. Except Tesla is growing at 50% YoY and companies like GM and Ford are not even close. That's why they're valued where they are.

I'm waiting for the Lexus EV Sedan myself, that and California PG&E rates to drop enough to where charging doesn't cost more than buying gas at $6 a gallon as it does now, the EV plan rates are on their site and the kWh used daily for me to charge for the range I would use at the rates being charged isn't worth it for me. Gas will only get cheaper, we are at historic all time highs...that might just push it off more for me idk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 03:11:17'] This seems like very good analysis but I don't know why you call it due diligence.Financial analysis is actually a much more valuable and better paid effort than DD. I have been a financial analyst and I would never do DD because it is boring, low value and generally done after all the big thinking is done. The process is usually identification, analysis, intention, DD, bid. DD is basically just aiding work making sure that the way the company represented itself is correct. "Due diligence is an investigation, audit, or review performed to confirm facts or details of a matter under consideration. In the financial world, due diligence requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party."[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp)I've been involved in dozens of transactions and this is correct. Financial analysis, like you have done is a big high-level effort directed at influencing the opinions of key decisions makers. DD is just a bean counting exercise that makes sure everything is what is is claimed to be. I haven't read your entire piece but see it as financial analysis, like that done in ER, other advisory or within deal shops. It does not look like the DD that these firms subcontract, typically to far less prestigious and lucrative outfits.I have been head of equity research, ran advisory businesses and at time have done commercial and strategic due diligence. I consider myself a financial analyst and quite frankly think DD below me. I wouldn't do it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 18:01:38'] NVDA is the only reasonable stock and even then should have about a 20% pullback.. I don't know of any fairly valued company anymore lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 20:06:40'] AFRM !  Don‚Äôt fear!! üí∞

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 17:52:43'] * AFRM - midcap* \[redacted\] - midcap* ASAN - midcap* CAR - midcap* DOCN - midcap* SYNA - midcapThe only stock on this list worth buying would be NVDA, but I don't own it because while they're a great company I don't expect their bull run to last forever, and they could easily drop and then trade sideways for 5 years. When they announced the ARM deal, their stock price shot up. I read an analyst last week saying that he thinks the market is pricing the stock as if the ARM deal won't go through. There is a lot of bull eagerness to price it in twice. During the earnings call the executive was talking about the growth of GPUs in the data center, and blah blah blah. They're a great graphics chip company, but the ones going into the server room are integrated, mostly from AMD. Lots of companies have tried to adapt ARM chips for the server room. Nobody has had much success. Mostly because the it would have to be a cheaper option, with lower margins. Well, commodity margins to bring the data center CPU costs down isn't a big revenue center. But investors really loved what he said. It could go up for another 5 years and then crash, or it could pop next week.SYNA was a great buy... last month.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 21:08:20'] This has to be the list of the easiest short plays of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 16:58:52'] DOCN better be pumping out more services like managed databases.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 22:16:59'] Nvda!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 23:02:53'] Large Cap? Most of those aren't in that class. I own Asana and expect it to be a solid long term hold. It has been getting battered recently and it may well be overvalued. Definitely on sale, but look to grab it under $100 if possible.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 23:17:45'] AFRM, LCID - Their TAMs are their playgrounds to run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 23:28:26'] If it were me, I'd follow Paul Pelosi's example and hold onto $NVDA :[https://www.2iqresearch.com/blog/the-sky-is-not-the-limit-for-pelosi-2021-09-23](https://www.2iqresearch.com/blog/the-sky-is-not-the-limit-for-pelosi-2021-09-23)  Check out: [https://app.capitoltrades.com/politician/491](https://app.capitoltrades.com/politician/491) The tech companies may be down for the day but they're not going dormant anytime soon

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 04:29:04'] DOCN is my best play of the year. Got in at $59. Really regret not getting in when it bottomed at $35.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 04:44:37'] NVDA for the home run
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 04:54:34'] Future bags...except maybe NVDA and CAR.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 04:56:03'] NVDA, looking to get in, i'm buying puts, if it goes further down I'll be exercised happly
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 05:05:49'] Holding NVDA since $14. Not selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 06:17:32'] NVIDIA Is definitely going up. They have an advantage producing a product that is hard to get elsewhere. They are a leader in the marketplace. We will continue to depend on NVIDIA to power computers, phones, and smart devices. Computer chips are like lifeblood.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 08:45:37'] Bought AFRM at $56.05 and am still holding. Good time to sell?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 08:51:19'] Only one I would buy long term is NVDA. I'd maybe buy some other ones for a quick play but I wouldn't seriously invest in any.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 09:32:19'] I have only 2 on the list and one of them is not Avis! So glad I bought NVDA but not so funny I sold AMD at $13.00. We shall see what is going to happen with this up and down market. I am just holding for now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 09:39:40'] Balls deep in LCID. Literally, my wife will chop them off if I lose more money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 10:57:45'] NVDA only one on the list I would buy. And also one of the best future looking companies in the world.
