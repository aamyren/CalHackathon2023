POST_TEXT: b'20 yr outlook. \n\nPFE has a seemingly empty pipeline currently, but they always seem to be relevant in the world of vaccines. \n\nJNJ is terrific, but is next years company split going to be a setback to investors?\n\nI own MRK. Trying to determine if adding a new fella in the sector is a good call vs continuing to hit the MRK button. Thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 22:32:36'] I like PFE. They’ve demonstrated throughout the pandemic that they have valuable partnerships and government relationships. Built a huge war chest with pandemic earnings. In this game those things matter almost as much as a pipeline.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 08:08:15'] Its almost impossible to evaluate Healthcare/pharmaceutical industries considering the the major unknown variable. I would say focus on fundamentals rather than the growth opportunity
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 22:15:34'] I have JNJ, also semi concerned over the company stock splitting - consumer/pharma.Was looking to double down just on the pharma side.  Otherwise was looking at CVS to swamp over into as health care sector
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 22:26:09'] I own MRK and JnJ. Merck's Keytruda has multiple indications and are constantly being added. JnJ has a decent size pipeline last I checked. When Abbott spent off Abbvie, it did wonders for the stock. I predict a similar performance boost with JnJ.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 23:43:38'] I own all 3 and will until I die.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 23:58:10'] Those are staples for the sector. However biotech has much more to offer over the course of 20 years. The future is gene therapy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 22:25:46'] VHT and be done.  Why guess?

POST_TEXT: b'I noticed Pfizer stock is at a 1 year low this morning. Figured it is a stock that as the COVID pandemic begins to go away more that we will just see it go down. Then realized it is Pfizer that will possibly buy up another company Seagen ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2)). Looked around some more and after all things considered it appears Pfizer is a buy. Many analysts say buy ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d)). I also say buy. \n\nWhy is Pfizer down though? Could it slide another 20%?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:58:21'] What’s their pipeline look like? If the Covid vaccine is their magnus opus, then I wouldn’t touch it for awhile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:23:38'] I am more of a BMY kind of guy
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:28:10'] Bought more today. It was a stagnant firm but the management now knows what they’re doing. They hit on the vaccine and the most effective antiviral for COVID. Pipeline is okay but getting better. Throw in a nice dividend yield and a worst case forward PE of ~21 in a few years, the risk profile feels right. Disclosure: Long PFE, BMY, MRK
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 12:56:11'] They are expected to buy Seagen? A biotech. It is costly so PFE will go down initially. It’s for long term
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:29:27'] I'm going to hold onto my shares and wait it out. At least the 4% dividend helps.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 09:12:40'] I hope so! I just sold my first put ever in my Roth on PFE $42.50 strike price expiring 3/17. I'm usually pretty conservative in my Roth because I don't want to take a chance on losing money I've already paid taxes on, but I decided to take a little risk this morning. From all of my research, I see their problems with innovation, but I also see that the market looks too pessimistic about them right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 19:22:12'] WSJ article by Hopkins and Seal says the expectation for Pfizer is $70 bil in sales vs last year's amazing $100 bil.  As people are saying in this discussion, the come down from COVID is the main reason.  Also I don't see another article now but a number of major drug companies are having important patents expire and generics are ready to take over in these niches.  That effected Pfizer too.  So there is a retreat ahead of that longer term problem.Still, I bought a small PFE position Friday as an opening salvo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:51:55'] Well, you can buy Pfizer and keep it just in case we have another pandemic. Today's HHS secretary is tommorow's Pfizer  board member.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:07:59'] I am curious too, what is causing the Pfizer stock to be at a 52 weeks low ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:37:07'] [removed]
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 12:17:34'] Wll, they make very healthy products... whats there not to like?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 20:30:50'] Idk about Pfizer but the pharma company I work at and specifically the division I work in was up 12% yoy on most products. Profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 04:57:36'] Their most recent 10k which is from 2021 mentions that their balance sheet is consolidated. More specifically "Our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of  failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products." Plus they mention that they were potentially going to take on debt due to business development which could affect their credit rating.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 05:42:28'] No
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 00:54:24'] I prefer AZN over PFE but they're both good companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 12:26:29'] Looking at PFE's historical financials (here: [https://jmp.sh/ZX2tYbSy](https://jmp.sh/ZX2tYbSy)) I would say that current Price/Sales is slightly below the long-term median, PE is actually below it's long-term median, rev, gross profit and operating income have been skyrocketing since the pandemic (e.g. why PE is lower than the median), net income and free cash flow have also been skyrocketing. Bottom line: the valuation chart (top left) shows that the stock is below the mid range of fair value. However, earnings have been skyrocketing only over the last 2-3 years. Historically revenue, gross profit and operating income as well as net income has been either very volatile and pretty much flat since 2002-2005. I would argue that it's not cheap enough at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:50:51'] I like it; it's like the exact same company as in 2018 but went from $40B to 0 debt basically. For some reason the market penalizes it for having had a Covid windfall; yeah the comparables won't look great, but that's a plus not a negative at today's near pre-Covid prices.The only thing is I don't think Pfizer is going to prioritize the shareholder with its cash. Their management makes clear they want to acquire companies, which while good for future growth is bad for someone looking for share buybacks/dividends. The best bull case is a very anti-trust inclined federal government. Still, probably a decent boring investment to hold. Not sure if will outperform SPY though.

POST_TEXT: b'Thoughts on each? Want to add health care/pharmaceuticals to my portfolio. It appears JNJ is splitting up, not sure if this is good or bad. ABBV is young and has a lot of debt.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:14:21'] I'm a fan of JNJ because of the diversity in their offering. Do your homework on the split but my opinion is that this should be a good thing for them. But honestly, can't go wrong with all three long term. Good luck friend!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:19:31'] Yes to all. In fact, I'm honestly having a hard time deciding which of the three to buy.I'll have my entire 401k to invest in 7 months and between the three I settled on PFE and GSK for Pharmaceuticals and ABBV for Biotechnology. I made my choices assuming I was retiring today. Portfolio would be 2.1% PFE, 1.6% ABBV, and 1.0% GSK.At this time I can't pick a best of the bunch so I'm going with several in the health care sector.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 22:13:39'] I have positions in $GSK & $JNJ , but to be honest , I’m far more comfortable with $GSK out of the 2
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 06:51:33'] i expect the vaccines to continue funneling tons of money onto PFE. they're already starting to say a 2nd booster (4th shot) will be necessary.government policy is a massive corporate handout when they institute city level mandates that everyone needs these boosters to enter a building in city limits. i definitely see long term upside on PFE.regardless of your opinion on mandates, the fact of the matter is that they're going to be profitable for the drug companies because it guarantees them far more sales than they'd have otherwise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 12:36:52'] PFE is a great hedge to hold onto now because it spikes on bad Covid news while the rest of the market responds negatively. Beyond that, they find themselves flush with cash and with much stronger partnerships and pipelines than before the pandemic. It’s certainly a hold, and likely a good buy right now. I could see $60 being a new baseline in the nearish future. All it takes is another blowout earnings which is a distinct possibility.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 20:37:55'] Moderna doubled since November
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 21:27:02'] I managed to buy at 120 and sell out at 140 then kept buying dips since then. I think I made my first thousand because of MRNA. I am just riding the hype waves rn but we shall see for long term.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 21:11:50'] My understanding is the vaccine is sold close to at cost, they made all their money with government subsidies. Probably won't shoot up from here. But lots of other sectors will shoot up once the vaccine is being distributed
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 00:38:16'] It's already priced in. Could go higher, but I still consider them considerably risky until they get FDA approval.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 22:43:30'] PFE has a 5 billion share float which is massive. It takes a lot to move the stock up. Not to mention, the revenue they will generate from the vaccine is a drop in the bucket relative to their total revenue. I expect it to move up with FDA approval but don’t expect a major jump.Compared to MRNA with a much smaller float around 300m shares. This revenue is quite meaningful, since they never had revenue prior and now proves their mRNA platform and rest of the pipeline. Hence why you are seeing much more growth in MRNA.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 09:31:54'] I actually prefer azn due to their low temperature storage requirement. Making it more transportable. I'm fairly certain the AIs predicting were gonna need more vaccine doses than all the pharma can make, including novavax, j&j and more and we'll have to buy extra from China, are correct. So pick the fundamental company or tech you like.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 21:40:49'] Reddit is a lagging indicator. It works better for meme stocks that are just starting to get noticed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 23:26:51'] Because PLTR
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 02:54:58'] MRNA is not a growth company. Theres a breakdown of MRNA already - 15B revenue in 2 yrs.. then drops off to 3B the next. Company is already at 60B cap. Theres not alot of profit in vaccines and i believe they get help from others to manufacture. Unless they can invent new miracle cures theres no reason to jump in anymore. And price target is closer to 100.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 09:32:32'] Because they already “sold” the bulk of their vaccines over the past 6 months regardless of if they work or not.  The fact they work will generate a few more sales of them, but at low margins and won’t really affect their bottom line
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-02 18:02:43'] With all the news on insider trading. The stock would go up as we wait for each 10Q results. Remember COVID is affecting the globe and not one country’s problem. Countries are skeptical on China vaccine SINOVAC with no complete transparency... CCP could have find multi village and start using farmers&kids so white mouse.. accelerate their version of Phase 1, 2, 3 and passed their own “FDA” standard and most probs the voters are not independent thinkers and make up the story of 80% efficiency.So my bets are still on $MRNA $PFE $AZN $JNJ.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 19:41:12'] [WSJ: Deutsche Bank Reports Higher Profit in Tumultuous Quarter](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-reports-higher-profits-in-tumultuous-quarter-3aedb0b?mod=markets_major_pos12).- Deutsche Bank reported a profit for the quarter ended March 31 of €1.32 billion—the equivalent of $1.45 billion—up from €1.23 billion a year earlier. [+8% YoY]- The results came in above an analyst consensus of €1.17 billion. - Pretax profit was the highest since 2013. - Revenue rose 5%, including an increase of 35% in its corporate banking division.- The bank said deposits declined 4.7% in the quarter, driven by competition and market volatility at the end of the period.-  1% [in deposits] left the bank in the last two weeks of March, and by end-April deposits had risen again - A key liquidity ratio increased in the first three months of the year despite the stress faced by regional American lenders and Credit Suisse. The liquidity coverage ratio measures how many easy-to-sell assets a bank has versus its deposits, an important metric for banks that face deposit outflows. It stood at 143% in the first quarter, above the 100% minimum requirement. - The German lender said revenue at its corporate-banking and retail business rose 35% and 10%, respectively, in the first quarter. At its investment bank, it fell 19%- “Things have stabilized in April essentially completely,” he said, adding Deutsche Bank saw no counterparties doing business with it stepping away.Seems important given that we were dooming about Deutsche Bank a month ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:35:05'] **Intro:** I would like to share some interesting tweets about $AMR from one of the most prominent coal experts on Twitter, Bruce Morelan. If you would like to see future comments/posts and wish to be tagged on posts about $AMR, let me know. I may put them in a child/old comment/separate post to avoid clogging up the Daily threads. I promise I'm just trying to share DD, not shill. So far I only know /u/creemeeseason is interested in $AMR.*Disclaimer*: I'm going to edit all Tweets for clarity/grammar/conciseness (go to the Tweet to see original wording).[Tweet 1](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652356806319153152):> During June and July 2022, Aussie Met fell from $500 to $200 and AMR fell from $180 to $104.  The day of earnings, AMR was $126.  Adjusting for 15% share reduction, that would be $145. Current share price $146.  Earnings in a week so [on an adjusted basis] we are exactly where we were a year ago: Same market cap $2.2B, and same met price $200+.[Tweet 2:](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652347351967866883)> > $AMR at 2024 average metallurgical coal futures price of $270. Earnings of 16x[270-27-43-110] = $1.44B. [16M tons is the production figure, then he calculates revenue - production costs]> -$240M o/h - $240M tax = $960M/13M = $74 EPS. This is a 1.97 P/E ratio on 2024 earnings using today's futures pricing for met--and met has been falling pretty hard recently. And no shares repurchased. O/H is... overhead?[Tweet 3.](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652035970370527232) As he states in another thread, this assumes NO shares repurchased.He projects for 2023:- $BTU: $1.70 + $2.00 + $1.50 + $2.80 = $8 EPS [forward 3.0 P/E]- $ARCH $10 + $6 + $6 + $12 = $24 EPS [3.6 forward P/E]- $AMR: $17 + $11 + $11 + $19 = $58 EPS [2.5 forward P/E][Tweet 4](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1647238028283478021): As he pointed out in his 'bull case,' if Met falls for 3 years (280, 240, then 200 average), and then we consider 3 scenarios for 2026: $180 met (103% upside), $250 met (202% upside), and $320 met (314% upside).[Tweet 5](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1647245289068331010) continuation: If Met *doesn't* fall for 3 years  (Stays at 280), the 3 listed scenarios for 2026 become +144%, +272%, +393%.[Tweet 6](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652335223877828610): In his extreme downside scenario ($22 EPS for AMR), we're trading at 6.5x earnings. He think we get 2.6x  that EPS in 2023 ($58).Bruce's estimates are pretty good generally. He called the weak BTU earnings for Q1 despite being one of the biggest bulls on Twitter about it. He also called the much stronger Q4 earnings that analysts were much much more pessimistic about. He grew a bit bearish about AMR recently thanks to falling met, but we'll see how that shapes up. Coal Twitter is predicting a very strong $AMR quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 13:49:50'] Other than earnings, what are the big announcements this week? Any chance the fed says something to interrupt this bull run?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 09:37:54'] If you’ve a stock that pops on earnings, do you typically sell and then try to time buying back in 30 days later or do you prefer to not dance in and out? I’m thinking about doing this for my ~9,000 shares of SoFi. If we get a pop up to $7.00, I could sell covered calls and then wait 30 days…this stock for the past few quarters has always just lost its earnings gains but I know the past is not always the future. Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 16:26:46'] Thoughts on $AMZN at this price? Their advertising growth + rumored margins seem promising… leaning towards buying more $VUG and calling it a day instead, but I feel like it may be a great $AMZN buying opportunity
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 14:19:11'] My conclusions after making another post that made it to the top of /r/stocks, along with conclusions from past posts I have made (I actually have quite a few in this sub). It is a mixture of observations and notes to self and even recommendations to others if you are someone that dislikes arguing with people on the Internet:- Responding to everyone is exhausting. Better to simply stop replying / disable inbox notifications (when you see someone say something you think is wrong and go to the top, it's tempting to always want to respond)--let others do the work for you.- You attract a lot more toxicity than in the Daily Discussion thread due to the higher number of people commenting. - A very diverse selection of responses that include:    - Conspiracy theorists (everything is manipulated by the Big Guys)    - Retail vs. Institution Class Warriors (every aspect of the stock market is designed to suppress us from rising up)    - Mr. I have an Anecdote that disagrees with your data    - Guy who gets angry that your post has an agenda (even before you posted any opinions and simply copy/pasted an article)    - High quality push back from very knowledgeable commenters that I very much value (please continue)    - The person who ties politics into every post    - Person who doesn't really follow the stock market and is just very confused but tries to learn- Never directly state things are looking up or good unless you wish to anger the hornets nest and obtain angry responses from people whose worldview is centered on being aggrieved about something. It also comes across as tone-deaf.  It doesn't matter how good or bad the economy or stock market--they will *never* be happy, and arguing with them will never make you look good.- Instead, when it comes to positive developments, sound as neutral as possible. Frame things as a question rather than an assertion. No need for neutrality when talking about negative developments. - If you enjoy arguments, disregard the previous two points.And finally, a word of appreciation to the Daily Discussion bros and gals: Ignoring the noise/trolls, there is a lot of high quality discussion every now and then, and pleasant exchanges to be had. I shall continue poasting data/graphs, glorifying coal stocks, and linking to Unhedged columns from the FT. And I may even post more memes of PutsRNotDaWae arguing with SeanK11 and InternationalTop2405.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 14:34:54'] TIL that when you purchase goods or services by sending someone crypto, you could end up in jail if you don't properly pay taxes.  So every time it goes up and you decide to spend some it's the same thing as cashing it out for fiat as an investment.Since everything on the blockchain is basically public and permanently visible for all to see, it's even worse than trying to secretly exchange gold for cash and the like.  This thing is even more useless than I thought.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 09:52:38'] Am I the only one that thinks NET is a screaming buy after it dropped as hard as it did on an earnings beat? TA wise, RSI just crashed to 27, good support at $43

Nearly 7% above estimates.https://i.imgur.com/1z7WPYt.pngClearly indicating that as I predicted, for all intents and purposes "recession" and earnings compression was actually last year, ber completely missed it bc they were too busy reeeee-ing about doom.Remember that **market will always bottom before earnings** that's what June was about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 17:11:28'] Edit: I am wrong, apologies.  FRCtards are probably screwed.  Some unsecured debt might be fucked too.  Still, this seems like an orderly outcome for the banking system!https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/29/first-republic-frc-jpmorgan-chase-bank-of-america-asked-for-bids.htmlSeems like FRC is likely to be saved.I think PNC should bid high and try to win.  Feels like they become TBTF and it would take them up to the megabanks.If they win the bid, I expect it to be very bullish for them as well.  As far as I can tell FRC is otherwise run fine despite duration risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 19:38:27'] Anyone who thought SVB would be the last Bank failure is deluded. So much for the Fed acting “swiftly and robustly” to stop the banking crisis. When Janet Yellen and the fed said that if your a big enough bank where failure could spark a contagion then all the depositors would be covered, that pretty much screwed the smaller banks by encouraging Americans across the county to pull there money and put it into the larger banks like Citi, WF, BAC and JPM where they know their money is safe. Just look at the deposit outflows at FRC, this will not be the last bank failure. Can’t wait for PutsRnotDaWae to reply with how this is actually bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 02:14:54'] From a shareholder perspective I’m happy that JPM is acquiring FRC, so the market doesn’t completely shit the bed with a bank failing and not being bought out, but does nobody else think this is a problem in terms of the big banks getting even bigger? I thought JPM was already at the legal limit for deposits size. Isn’t this essentially the government deciding what companies (JPM this time) get a windfall?

POST_TEXT: b'You would think with the cost plus contracts Pfizer has with the US government and the opportunity to sell their Covid vaccine to the rest of the world that Pfizer would be selling around $45 or $50 per share. Instead its fallen in the last six months\nIs this stock a laggard or just dead money'
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 10:25:07'] The hopefully effect of the vaccine on the stock price was way over blown. Another vaccine for Pfizer is like a new grocery item for Walmart - yes there will be increase in revenue, but its just one of many they have.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 12:10:24'] Pfizer is basically giving this vaccine away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 10:49:33'] The time to buy pharma for vaccine increases was March/April 2020.They're a solid company with a decent dividend tho for the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 10:43:16'] 10 45 call contracts at 41 went to 44 then dipped to 37 and stayed there just as the vaccine got approved and was shipping out. Biggest loss I've had
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 13:31:30'] Holding for a couple years. DCAd down in 2020 to $30. Now it's 3% of my portfolio, kind of a bond proxy with upside. Pipeline is really good, also eliquis is going to be a blockbuster for years to come and will be more utilized as the population ages and gets fatter/needs thinner blood. Sales will skyrocket especially with all of these covid blood clots. The covid vaccine is going to be seasonal for a while then who knows. Not expecting huge growth but I have a good price, getting dividend, still adding slowly
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 23:42:48'] Stock has been dead for 2 decades
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 04:47:21'] At this price they have a really good dividend yield. Was doing some research on dividend yields at current prices for a few big names. XOM of course is up there, but PFE and T were very nice as well. Only worry about T is if they will cut dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 10:18:08'] Pfizer is total dogshit unless you are wealthy and can afford to hold 500K or more shares for the divided, otherwise pure DOGSHIT!!! Not many companies get a few billion INCREASE in revenues and go on to bleed for months, takes a real deal PIECE OF SHIT!!!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 11:10:33'] Lol enjoy your  pfizer, here is a prediction it will be between 30 and 40 dollars next year just like it is every year. Hey like I said if your rich and you can hold a bunch for the 1.50 divided your good, if you want to invest hoping for the shareprice to go up you will be sorry you bought it. Funny how some get sandy snatches like bitches when you tell the truth about something they want to pump.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:15:29'] Don't think there's a lot of profit made from covid vaccines, I was under the impression that most would be sold at cost or a little over cost so that poorer nations could be subsidised
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:00:08'] I’m guessing here but as more vaccines get approved that means there is less market share available for them. Also a chance that the market doesn’t think this will need to be a recurring shot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:38:19'] There is no profit in vaccines. Most developed countries have laws preventing profiteering and under developed countries simply can’t afford excessive prices. Not sure why anyone thought a vaccine would be a cash cow...

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 23:07:57'] Their market cap and revenue is so large that the revenue from covid vaccines is not significant enough to move the stock price. Lots of people probably bought in and then sold after once they realized this as well.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 08:24:16'] Market cap
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 08:32:04'] PFE is a great company it’s mature/established and will manufacture whatever vaccine wins. It’s not prone to parabolic movements. Hold it and enjoy a bit of steady dividend and growth.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 08:26:23'] Just compare the market caps. Pfizer has been one of the leading companies in its sector for wayyyyy too long.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 08:47:01'] The headwind for Pfizer is that they are spinning off their off-patent drug division at the end of the year. Once they’re through that, it will be a smaller company and they should have some better growth prospects.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 09:30:51'] Random guy on the internet mentioned Moderna, so incoming 3% increase. Pfizer could cure cancer and theyd rise 0.015%Yes, Im exaggerating. But yeah, pfizer has a massive market cap.I think Moderna is going to live/die stockwise based on if they are the first and main covid vaccine maker.But I get what youre saying, everydsy pfizer has great news and little happens to their stock
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 10:20:17'] It's got a 4% dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 10:05:53'] I think PFE in this day and age will only move on extremly good news.. Such as big ER beat or approval of a pipeline drug. I bought a call with long exp date because i know it will most likely trend downwards for some weeks maybe months before it starts to push up. It was setting up for a triangle break out but it seems to have failed so will probably continue to trend downward until they have news of a pipeline drug or their phase 2/3 trials but they wont come for many more months to go, but if you are willing to hold for 2-3 years+ it should give you a firm growth. But its not a good stock for swing trading in my opinion.

POST_TEXT: b"$SGEN was acquired by $PFE earlier this year for $229/share and set to close \\~Q4 '23/Q1 '24. Currently trading at $198 for potential 15% gain. The merger is all cash and concerns about anti-trust regulation seem to have been quelled by recent divestments. There is a huge multibillion dollar penalty if it were to not go through, so it seems good motivation to get it done. Shareholders still have to approve, but seeing as it was bought at quite a premium, I can't imagine that will be an issue. The biotech realm may be a little spooked about regulation blowing deals up, as was done with Illumina's acquisition of Grail, but this feels more solid. Many ADC companies in the same space are being snapped up, so I would expect this will go through. Money isn't cheap anymore and likely isn't getting cheaper, so I could see how this may not be as attractive a play as other parts of the market for a longer hold. But 15% in <12mo would be a solid return for anyone I would think!\n\nWhat are your tho"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 00:24:27'] If it goes through great.  If not you've held a stock for a year while it basically does nothing and now it's share price has cratered.  But then again I'm just talking out of my ass because I have no clue what that company does specifically and what regulatory hurdles Pfizer faces.  Biotech to me is a few huge companies, hundreds of mostly scam ones and apparently companies like this which have reached the make it phase of fake it till you make it.And the penalty is immaterial at least as far as Pfizer is concerned.  It's a rounding error on their balance sheet.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-16 12:35:09'] Pfizer is a brand name drug company that relies on its brand name products for revenue. So a few reasons why their pe is so low. It’s actually 11 from what I see on yahoo. It’s a yield company as in their revenue is no longer growing so you are looking at it from a yield perspective and in this environment that means dividend as earnings is fairly volatile. You also have to consider that in order for them to maintain profitability they have to constantly invest in brand name drugs which is very expensive and does not guarantee a blockbuster hit like viagra for example. They also are in direct competition with generic drug companies. There is also potential risk with regulation in the future which is a REAL risk. As such 11pe 4.5% dividend yield sounds fairly valued to me from just a broad view glance.But yea, considering in this market everything is overpriced fairly valued is undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 10:55:27'] Even relative to the S&P500, DHR and TMO had absolutely insane runs off the COVID bottom, because their EPS was going bonkers.  EPS is returning to trend now, and the hype is boiling off.Anyway, the proximal reason is that tightening financial conditions and "the year of efficiency" meme means biotechs are spending less on picks and shovels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 11:03:28'] Not that I work for either of these companies but I work for a smaller company that manufactures instrumentation for clinical and biotech customers. Simply put, capital budgets are tight and unless the product is absolutely a must, it’s getting pushed out into next year. During COVID, companies were receiving crazy amount of capital money from the gov’t, even for instruments that weren’t directly involved with COVID. Contrary to this, their consumable and disposable revenues should still be pretty healthy since they’re needed to run the instruments (the margins are probably very good too) and companies are now heavily relying on ROI associated with tech time, sending out samples, etc. I think eventually things will rebound, perhaps 2023, but things are tight now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 21:00:50'] Because the housing shortage, shortage of doctors and increased inflation will probably drive most of the baby boom generation into poverty, health care companies are probably planning on spending less because there will probably be declining sales in the future.Even though the need is expected to grow drastically, many people in need to health care are going to do without health care. They won't be able to afford it, can't access it and can't afford health insurance. Spending on medical equipment isn't profitable if you are not going to have increasing sales. People will probably vote against government funding of "free" health care.

They just had the spin-off the Upjohn division, and people got shares of VTRS as a result, so there’s some loss of PFE value commensurate with the spinoff, as well. That was about a week or two ago. (I don’t recall except seeing the VTRS shares drop in. It was maybe the 16-17th-ish.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 09:36:49'] would you recommend holding PFE in a brokerage or ROTH
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 22:08:45'] PFE also had part of it (Viatris) split out which will reflect in the value of the stock.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi all, \n\nI'm looking to invest ~20k in the pharma sector. I usually like to pick one large cap and one small/mid cap in each sector I invest in. I'm looking to buy and hold (2-3 yrs at least). I'm having a hard time choosing between ABBV, PFE and AZN for the large cap option. All of their drug pipelines look solid, YTD growth looks good, a couple enjoy covid related tailwind, dividend looks promising, etc. \n\nIf you had to pick one, which one would it be and why? \n\nThanks in advance!\n\nPS: Dunno if this is relevant, but the small/mid cap I'm eyeing to go with this large cap is LVGO."
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-27 00:46:07'] I would go with ABBV, great long term stock. Solid dividend.Great article on the company: http://thinkingforward.site/abbvie-inc/
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-27 06:49:42'] I'd pick Pzifer over the rest. I don't like ABBV's balance sheet and they bought Allergan because they're about to lose the patent on their blockbuster drug.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-26 18:39:40'] I actually own all three. If you want to go with safe and stable company: go with ABBV. If you want with risk and possibility for higher growth, go with AZN. Don't go with PFE: they have not invested much in R&D and it shows: I think, they will be flat for awhile. I am holding to PFE to see what's going to happen to their Corona-virus vaccine in partnership with biontech.

PFE is a giant and a rather non-volatile blue-chip.BNTX was over 10x small than PFE pre vaccine news, their portfolio is much smaller and the impact of one success is therefore much bigger. BNTX was a mid cap at much higher risk, therefore the reward is better than with PFE...We also have no clue how much money will be made off off this by either company, so it's all very speculative right now.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 07:33:26'] I got into PFE at about $35. It's slowly and steadily worked its way up, and I would expect that to continue. It's not gonna be the volatile rocket that MRNA is, although I will hold both for a long time as PFE is just a good stable company and MRNAs technology will open many doors for them long term.

I have beaten this dead horse for years - reduce the position and invest in other things.  However,  if i were to have an emotional attachment to money (never, hah.), PFE isn't a bad name...You need to love, understand, and appreciate....management. PFE's CEO impressed me on a recent earnings call when he went ballistic on an analyst asking for more stock buybacks. PFE's CEO in so many words said we aren't buying back any stock when there are opportunities to grow retained earnings and invest in the business.  Period.  There's a good chance the stock sees some lower levels, but I like the setup for the long haul and I really like the current management telling folks that profit from short term gains to get bent, we have a long term business to run.

They are all followed by very smart analysts who make a lot of money trading them and our market is very efficient (especially at the levels of the mega companies).  BUT they are correctly valued for today.  They trick is the value in the future and no one knows 100%.  It is easy to picture a company returning to its 1 or two year high (many are 50, 60 or more % off).  Two months ago I would have said SWK and VFC were my two favorites.  GSK has a P/E of 4.  INTC seems pretty cheap.  MMM is cheap but maybe for a reason (litigation) -- but I have still bought it.  Bottom line I guess is be careful about looking at 2 to 5 year charts and assuming a stock will get back to where it way.  Just go back to 2000 and see how long it took the NASDAQ to recover.  It will again, but how long?  I owned MSFT and Oracle back then but gave up on them after a few years.... Mistake!  Best of luck.

But on a comparative basis, if macro is good, I'm assuming more upside than other potential ideas I have.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 18:58:33'] If you are looking for a stock that has returns similar to a CD, why not just put the money in a CD? It would be the same return with less risk.

You can withdraw the principal amount you have invested in your Roth IRA at any time. In addition, you can withdraw the invested funds at any time prior to retirement without being subject to penalties or taxes on early withdrawals. It is a very useful retirement account that provides you with many flexible options that can help you achieve financial freedom

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 20:19:28'] HIG- trading at 6x FCF and 10x earnings. Insurance companies tend to do well in high interest rate environments because they earn more returns in their portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 03:30:36'] I like your thinking here. To me, Google is a MUST core holding. Trading at 18.9x current year earnings, the stock is just downright cheap. Love your Adobe pick as well. I think this is an underrated stock and the valuation has been as cheap as it has been in years. I started adding to this position a week or so ago. Take a look at Visa as well, which is starting to look more and more attractive.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 04:07:07'] You're gonna do very well long term. Nice picks. Looking very closely at TROW and DOW right now.Check out trinseo TSE as well as an industrial... bears are crushing it due to debt but the company will sell a division for around 1.4B when credit markets loosen. That's 70% of their net debt. On an average year they generate half their market cap in FCF. Once debt is gone bears are fucked.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 11:25:36'] Why do you want to throw yourself under a falling knife?  There’s no such thing as a “good” price when a further fall is nearly inevitable.  Play the market as it is, not how you want it to be.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 22:33:53'] A deal isn't a deal when the price is still dropping.  There is no reason to buy into something right now.  It's not like you're going to "miss out" if you wait for the market and these stocks to truly settle.I took a look at every single one of those stocks.  Not one is a good buy right now.  They will be good buys, certainly, but every single one is dropping, some worse than others.Wait, there's one that sort of ok, GILD.  You might be okish with LOW too.  I'm also a fan of NFLX. I think a deliberate bad marketing ploy pushed their prices down to stupidly low levels.  Their metrics are rock solid and among the best they've ever been at.  Despite this, they're priced like it's 2017 which is nuts.  I honestly expected them to recover fast.  Surprisingly, the marketing seemed to work, and they've stayed unusually low.  I made a little on their initial ramp back up, but they stagnated.  Long term, they're still a solid bet.  When you actually compare them against every other streaming service, they are basically a titan in comparison, not just in raw subscriptions, but their growth has constantly been better.  They should have been back up to $600 by June, frankly.  I'm expecting their October financials to be well above estimates.I don't mind deals.  There's a lot of stuff that are deals.  I just think most of these will see better sales.  Nearly everything you mentioned is still going down and there is neither confidence nor investment momentum in any of them.  The only outlier looks to be GILD, but that's it.There's a few things that are green right now and that will make you money right now.  But a lot of what's paying out right now is Bear indexes/ETFs.  You're betting against nations, real estate, various markets, or commodities like gold (which oddly should be good in a down trend...but isn't right now).  Think YANG, DRV, DUST, or EDZ.  Yeah, it's not long term buys, but this is a garbage market, and if you're looking to make or keep money, you're betting right for garbage.  For example YANG made 86% over the last 3 months.  Sure, going bear on China is kind of a sucky thing to think about, but this is the kind of stuff that's paying out right now.  When the recession hit late last December, it was oil paying out.  While the market tanked, you could have bet into oil and made 2x to 4x over just a few months.  At that time, that was about the only thing green.  Right now, green is betting on failure.  It's definitely a bear market, and (some) leveraged bears are making serious cash.But if you want safe and stagnant, you can easily just shove your cash in SPY or any equivalent, and it will sit flat for a good while.  This was a reasonable choice to ride the down trend early in the year.  You didn't really lose all that much versus a lot of other choices.  And it's still a good buy to just sit on and forget for 20 years.As for single companies, I tend to favor someone that's changing the world as we know it.  There's not a lot out there that I look at and think "wow, they're really doing something amazing and pioneering the next decade, the next century."  Tesla's about the only one that stands out to me.  People want to say that it's overpriced still, but there really aren't many companies comparable.  However, it's a stock that's dead flat right now.  I'm also curious how hard other automakers are going to encroach into the EV space.  Tesla's kind of had the luxury of being solo in the space for about a decade.  That's going away.  But the company is well run, and they're the only company self producing batteries and have enough batteries to actually build their cars.  No other automaker is doing this.  Others can make EVs, but battery production for them is limited.  Plus very few are in the market at any real volume outside of a couple brands like Ford are pushing real volume numbers into this space.  While Tesla's producing a million cars, brands like Rivian are targeting like 15,000.  There is no comparison to the shear volume Tesla has in that space.  They simply dominate it.  And it's not just cars.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 04:15:45'] No. You are taxed on capital gains. If your cost basis is higher than the sale price of the stock, you would not owe any taxes because you would have a loss.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 16:16:29'] You only pay if you made money on them. Even then, you likely don't owe any taxes because of the tax bracket you are in which considering you only have 20 dollars, is in the 0% range.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 19:12:42'] Get robinhood. Screw cash app. You report losses which are when you sell something at a loss or you have a contract that expired. You wait for this in the mail to file with the rest of your stuff

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 05:16:35'] What I bought this week:\- T Rowe Price (not the funds they offer, but rather shares of TROW itself): this is a solid company with history of more than 100 years, and is (at least from my analysis) discounted right now. A relatively  stable stock to see me through relatively unstable times.\- Facebook: the cool kids prefer TikTok, but I expect they will grow out of it, start wearing cardigans, and turn to Facebook just like the "OK, Boomer!" crowd they mock. Plus, the company is a money fountain.\- GOOGLE: probably the most solid FAANG company, but shockwaves from Netflix and the Fed ripped into an insane discount yesterday: so I loaded up\- A Vanguard Whole Market Index ETF: because this should be the basis of any portfolio in an emerging bear market: sure, you take all the hits, but you also take all the gains, as money flies around through the rollercoaster ride.\- Alibaba: the most discounted stock I own. Probably a bigger risk than anything else in my portfolio, but I don't have paper hands, so am willing to see this rise or fall long term.

Bought some 1 day calls hoping for a bounce at 430, but we broke through bottom resistance instead.  RIP calls Puts and calls on Tesla.  We're trading around the midpoint of the bull flag.  Could go to top or bottom resistance lines.  Top resistance is break even.  Breaking top is $.  Bottom is $$$$.Puts on AMZN, sold at Friday close, may grab one next week in hopes for a disastrous earnings report on Thursday.Puts on ENPH, sold most of them Friday.  Could go lower, just trying to simplify my portfolio and see what the market is doing next week after such a huge drop.Long term calls on TTWO, mid term puts.  I mean, GTA VI...  Been waiting for a major pullback for awhile.  Love this gaming company.  We're on the bottom diagonal resistance line.  Could break it next week,or could retrace back up.  Hoping we see a short term breakdown and big bounce by September.Mid term Calls on NFLX after it tanked...big bet...but added some short term puts just in case.  Probably should have added short term puts earlier, already lost half on this one because of that.  A bounce to 300 would be interesting for my portfolio.Long term calls on AMRS, because ya neva know.  Probably a dumb bet tbh.Puts on AMD, sold Friday.Puts and Calls on BITO.  There is a case for BTC dropping to 20000-23000 before running back up to all time highs.  The short term calls are to play the bear flag band... We're at the bottom resistance line.  Long term puts if the bear flag confirms.  I'll be buying all the calls if the bear flag confirms down to 23000.I'm a SPY buyer if S&P drops to 3900-4000 and begins consolidating against strong resistance to the downside.  4300 was where I expected a bounce if we were confirming a reverse head and shoulders, but it broke through that and I had already taken profits on most of my puts.  Blah.  If it gets to lower bull flag resistance line at 3900-4000, I'll be big on calls with a put for protection.  There is a weak case for S&P breaking the lower bull flag resistance and dropping back 3600.  Not a high chance, but it's there.Once it bottoms, I'm hoping to see another run up to all time highs, before we move into recession / bear market either late this year or early next year.

I couldn't resist starting a new position that I will be building over the next couple of months.  GOOGL - I have MSFT already and never really had too much desire to get into FAANG  but recent prices and the upcoming split got my attention enough to start a very small position. I won't be expanding on it until after earnings and the split though.   BE, NRGV, MNTK, ARIS, BAC, & AFCG - expanded on my desired portfolio of greens in renewables and cannabis. BAC in particular would have been a curious choice for me when I first started investing but I've been aiming to diversify, wanted a banking stock with a good dividend, and their movement toward sustainable finance has me interested enough.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 10:34:27'] Right now I am thinking about starting a small position in Lowes(LOW) and Starbucks(SBUX). They seem like good plays right now as they have the most negative news around them and they are both great businesses. Both the stocks are getting hit the worst in terms of the overall Market. I am currently researching and I am still holding a lot of cash on the side right now in case they run down even more which case I can DCA. Overall just not a lot of good buys all my stocks I am green on and pretty overpriced. I am still buying my weekly Vanguard share but I havent bought any stocks since Target(TGT) ran below $200.00 and as soon as started buying it ran up. Just not a lot of good buys right now sadly except Intel(INTC). I am already satisfied with my Intel position I built and not looking to add more unless its get extremely stupid cheap to the point I cant ignore it.

	COMMENT: ['2016-07-28 08:14:00'] Best way to learn is to jump in and start making some mistakes. Why not buy small lots of both? Sure you could research it, but you'll remember the little things way better if you have real money on the line. Pick an amount that you are okay losing 100% of and start from there. 
	COMMENT: ['2016-07-28 09:48:47'] According to this: http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/07/27/with-40m-bid-pfizer-set-to-buy-and-close-bankrupt-bind-tx/ it seems as if owning BIND at this point is super risky in the sense that even if the deal goes through, you still may end up with no value. Is this correct? Even though the bid is for over double the current market cap, your shares could be rendered useless?

	COMMENT: ['2015-11-21 17:22:47'] The thing is in a merger the acquiring company usually goes down in value, while the acquired company goes up. This deal is weird, because its not exactly clear who will be the acquirer. 
	COMMENT: ['2015-11-20 13:19:51'] It should open green on Monday, I strongly believe the deal gets done to make a merger. But who knows... 
	COMMENT: ['2015-11-20 13:29:25'] Will there be an inversion, which would cause a tax hit to shareholders? Will Allergan buy Pfizer instead? Some discussion on CNBC that the deal will be 11 shares of PFE for every 1 share of AGN, but who knows. I'm somewhat interested in how this plays out, but I feel as if I can wait it out and see how this plays out rather than trying to figure out how to jump in now. Additionally, Pfizer has not exactly handled prior acquisitions that well.Still, I think Pfizer's ultimate goal is splitting up the company.

	COMMENT: ['2015-02-10 12:22:55'] As of today I'd say PFE. Due mainly to the growth potential being better. T is definitely a less risky option giving you about 5% dividend growth and appreciation consistently.  But in all actuality....these are in different sectors...why not both for diversification??

As a caveat, I do own SCHD which has exposure to these areas, but Im looking to build my defensive side of the portfolio. \n\n1. Consumer Staples (already have KO and Pepsi with SCHD)\n\n2. Healthcare (already have exposure to Amgen, MRK, and PFE from SCHD)\n\nIve been looking at COST, WMT, JNJ, and a few others, but Im curious as to what others opinions are. Thank you in advance!'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 15:44:01'] Not comfortable with Costco at a PE 2x Google
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 14:37:27'] I like utilities. Just buy VPU if you don’t wanna research.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 16:45:07'] Keep it simple. I'd recommend looking into two ETFs: VDC (Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF) and VHT (Vanguard Health Care ETF). The top 10 holdings of both ETFs are excellent businesses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 11:35:28'] How about McDonalds? They didn’t budge in 2008 and have been on a constant ascent since. Most predictable stock I can find.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 03:46:11'] I preferred diversified manufacturers like HON.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 18:05:48'] Look at actual defense. I just opened q position in Lockheed Martin recently, and will be adding more if it goes down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 20:21:56'] HRL and GIS - the packaged food sub sector of the consumer staples sector are probably my favorite defensive stocks SO and AWK - utilities are another solid defensive sector

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 07:45:42'] Buy bonds.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 14:54:21'] Wanted to come back and say after looking at some etfs to play defensively, HDV actually looks fairly solid. 65% of the allocations are towards Healthcare, Energy, Consumer Staples, and Utilities. Perfect combo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 05:41:08'] The energy stocks had a much different reddit history than the growth stocks. Everybody hated them a couple years ago now they are quite popular.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 09:16:02'] Do opposite of others have an edge. That is the tradtional contraian strategy.  90% gain is already factored in when one finds out. The 10% contrarians potentially gets the new 90%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 09:25:54'] My bachelor's thesis was on this. My dataset consists of just posts that mention S&P500 tickers, and spans from 1st January 2019 to 25th April 2022. I used r/stocks, r/stockmarket, and r/wallstreetbets. From the research I've done I found the direct correlation between sentiment expressed on Reddit and the price movement of particular stocks in the S&P500 to be 0.45 (using the Pearson correlation coefficient). It's a small correlation, but certainly not negligible. Definitely something you'd want to only be looking at from a macro-level, weekly/monthly movements and not daily-charts.I've been intending to get back into the project and wrap things up with a short-and-concise publication, been too busy with work-work (and procrastinating). 😅
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 03:22:51'] your 3 year time horizon is not a good sample size, also the interest rates have been so low.  look what has happened since they have increase rates.  if your study had a 15 year time horizon, i think it would have more validity&#x200B;BTW you probably chose some of the most liquid and largest market cap and widely held securities in the US equity market
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 04:49:05'] Way to pick and choose certain stocks to fit your bias. Reddit favored way more stocks then TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, and AMZN. Stocks like PLUG, ARKK, XPEV, NIO, NVDA, WKHS. Stocks that have basically went down the toilet this year. Also no serious investor looks at 3 year returns then calls themselves a winner. Investors that are most successful are the ones that pick stocks that outperform for many many years.

	COMMENT: ['2014-10-24 12:32:16'] I just watched a TV segment on PFE on CNBC. The analyst they just had on was bullish stating that in the past years since the debt crisis, PFE has had 3 major pull backs of approx 5-6% each time, then rallies significantly. Looks to be following this pattern right now.Plus if you look at the chart, you can see and upward trend with the price on the lower level. So the potential for a upswing is good now.

He is essentially the  only major hedge fund manager employing a traditional value investing strategy. Most others at this point are using more complex leveraged/quant/algorithmic trading strategies. He has been right more often than wrong. The SPAC was a disaster, but it’s not his fault people hyped the expectations so much, and we don’t know the final outcome of it yet. I have never had any money in PSTH, but it was by definition speculative and the current value rests exactly at its intrinsic and original value of $20.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 03:58:25'] This is some top class bullshit. Whatever your opinion of Vaccination and remedial medication for COVID, the tide of public acceptance for the current threat of COVID is diminishing.Beyond that, the public distrust in institutions and governments is palpable; at the centre of all that is Pfizer, this target is little more than hope that you will take their bags
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 13:14:49'] COVID franchise? Ok, well I guess that made my decision to not get the endless boosters a little easier.

And 6x more than tesla and tesla has been on the list for a year.  It only targets short low quality posts & comments.**update3** c'mon, it's not that bad, at least I removed amc, nok, bb, and a bunch of other stocks off the meme list since barely no one talks about them anylonger :D

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 12:08:52'] My condolences to FB dip buyers. On a serious note, I just cannot work out how the metaverse thing is going to work.MV doesn't really exist so it's a bit nebulous to begin with. When you have emerging tech like 3D printing or hydrogen engines that technology already exists. Sure maybe its primitive and it sucks in its current state and its not economically viable right now, nonetheless it does exist. MV does not exist right now and it's supposed to be the next big thing for FB. It's a bit iffy to say the least.Anyway, if you have read the MV manifesto you will know that MV is not VR, it's not AR, it's not living in a video game. That's like saying that my iPhone is the Internet. Ok, so the thing about MV is that it's completely open and interoperable platform. So how will that square up with FB's goal to make MV into a walled garden? It just cannot be by definition. There cannot be "Facebook's MV" like there cannot be "Google Internet". Internet is internet, if one website is polluted by annoying immutable ads you will leave that website and go to another one. But (and I've just checked this) FB revenue is 98% advertising and 2% other. So how will FB monetise this MV? People will simply flee away if is littered by BS ads. Well maybe they hope that if they build the first big MV platform people will stick around even if it sucks (just like Facebook...) I suppose if they are first to the game and they get the network effect going then maybe. Still that's a big IF.Ive spend some time figuring out what MV really is supposed to be and I just cannot see how FB will win in it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 10:23:23'] I can only speak to my own experience. I’m a multi-family construction executive in the southeastern US. We have had difficulty staffing for the last 1.5 years. Our salaries have gone up over 25% on average and we are having to adjust salaries twice a year to keep people. My lowest paid assistant superintendent makes over 90k a year now. Lead superintendents and project managers are making over 200k a year now, and we have a hard time staffing even with those wages. I know every industry is different, but the labor shortage is real in my industry and it means higher wages.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 10:54:27'] 10 year Recruiter here…Yes the market is very hot for candidates. Companies have increased wages 15-20% easily in the past 12 months. More options as well because of remote work (if that applies to the job). Competition for those jobs has also increased though - with remote work you’re competing with the entire country now not just your city/neighboring cities. And for more labor intensive jobs that can’t be remote - that plant down the street that’s offering $18-$20/hr instead of $15? Yea you’re not the only one applying. $20/hr is enough to hire some recent college grads these days.

A lot of my relatives work at manufacturing plants in Ohio, Michigana and Indiana, and they all gotten a significant increase.  I am in rural Ohio, and I have raised wages by 40% since the pandemic. Most likely by this time next year, we will increase it by another 15-25%. Last year's raise was because it was hard to find employees. This year we raised it because of the inflation and want to stay ahead of the competition. You can see some trends here. It's usually lags few months: https://www.bls.gov/ect/

POST_TEXT: b'Saw an interesting argument unfold in this sub recently on the topic of fundamental analysis.

Is doing analysis really not that advantageous?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:28:06'] Fundamentals do not matter when the Bull runs free... When individuals start taking heavy losses, all of a sudden it matters...
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 02:04:24'] The way I see it, fundamentals are the foundation on which to build your speculation
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 04:55:36'] A basic reason for fundamental analysis, you can avoid buying stock in a company that might be near bankruptcy.  If you were buying a car wash you would do fundamental analysis, so why not a publicly traded business?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:24:12'] In the short term no. In the long term yes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:12:00'] the interpretation of data is what matters
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 04:50:18'] I'd bet less than 1/10 people who pick stocks spend more than 1 hour on actual fundamental analysis.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 03:21:31'] If somebody (like in this thread) says that fundamental analysis is bullshit you know that you are right to use fundamental analysis. But don't use it the traditional way. Many numbers have to be corrected for what actually happens, many numbers are pure but legal... lies.And an example of a discussion I had lately: oil stocks or oil futures? I said with the right kind of fundamental analysis you can make more money, get a better leverage and less risk with stocks than with oil futures. With fundamental analysis you could find stocks that could not make money with the oil price but had cash to survive many years. So buying those was a bet on rising prices but with a big leverage and no risk of losing more than invested (remember, futures were and a negative $37.63 a barrel).You need any kind of analysis and you have to think always out-of-the-box.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 03:47:49'] This is the equivalent to saying "(almost) everyone has a body and limbs, but not everybody is a professional athlete so what you do with your body doesn't matter".Not everyone has the same brain that's capable of analysing that data, and not everyone puts in the same amount of work. So of course it matters. It's exactly the reason why some become millionaires and others don't.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:53:20'] They do, but they need to be followed by events that trigger the stock te become known. There are a lot of undervalued stocks that aren’t going anywhere because the catalist hasn’t arrived yet, so if you hold an undervalued Company with strong financials long enough you should be due to make money at some point
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:53:02'] Of course it matters, 1) Yes everyone has the data but how many people actually use it?Passive retail? NoActive retail? Not very well generallyDay/momentum traders? NoPension funds? Well they do but they have to stick to strict allocations so they can't act on itInvestment Banks? Well they do but their holdings are so large they can't action it wellHFTs? No, it's irrelevant to themHedge funds? Yes but honestly not as well as you might expect.2) Fundamental analysis obviously can't tell you how much you stand to gain, you can't predict the future either in terms of momentum or company performance. However, it can tell you how much you stand to lose which is extremely valuable.3) Because you understand what you have bought is worth it makes it much much easier to cope psychologically with volatility.People who don't want fundamental analysis to matter generally don't because they don't want to do it. Research should be 95% of your time spent.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 04:00:43'] I think finance has “fundamentally” changed. With the pandemic, the rush of retail traders that didn’t exist before, and the ease of downloading an app and making trades has made huge changes to the overall market.To answer though, I believe it still plays a part, but to a much lesser extent. And as someone said, more long term than short term.This is anecdotal.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 00:56:11'] If fundamental analysis wouldn't matter, Warren Buffet would be one of the richest people of the world. The thing is just, that most people don't do good fundamental analysis
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:52:51'] Is water wet?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 04:54:59'] The basic principle of fundamental analysis states that:Value= present value+future growth discountedEverybody can easily calculate the first, but the second? There is no formula which can predict the future. Eventually it all boils down to projections and opinions. So if there is a company which you think is bullshit but the whole market thinks it has a great future, there is no such thing as "overvalued". And what's funnier, over time if the market trusts a certain company, this will probably eventually grow, like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Remember: the market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 02:41:43'] Fundementals are only a piece of the puzzle. Many people also say TA is like astrology, as if there aren't successful traders that utilize TA daily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 02:46:47'] You can statistically test fundamental analysis, and on average, it does seem to provide a premium over the market. The key is “on average”. There is a large academic literature on “quality” and “profitability” for example. However, it’s very far from a sure shot road to outperforming the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 03:26:06'] Doing your own fundamental analysis is probably worthless, but having a general overview, and finding those who know more than you and who you trust and who base themselves on their analysis is probably worthwhile.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 05:50:57'] Analysis matters in a free, natural market. But we don’t have that, particularly now. Forever going forward, we have big banks and governments who can move prices with huge funding during off hours. We have market makers who watch trading with 100% visibility of everyone’s trades, and they can ID and bet with those trends all day,every day, while that info is hidden from everyone else. Add microsecond high freqency trading and they can make small profits hundreds of time a day getting in/out of positions before retail can thell there is movement. All of that is systemic. So maybe you can account for it in your research. What is unusual in the last 20 years is the gigantic amount of money pumped into the markets by govt debt, via loans to the biggest wall st banks. $20 trillion in new dollars added to the world (Really $40 T if you count both the new dollars spent by govt and the T notes circulated as collateral.)What fundamental research can tell you the impact of trillions of extra dollars pumped in, and eventually, out, of the markets?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 01:45:23'] No , it doesn't matter , it's all a sentiment and decisions of wall street aka hedge funds
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 04:22:30'] Oh my god. Yes. You’ll lose all your money even asking this question. Ask anyone who traded growth between Jan 2021 and Jan 2022.x
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 03:29:09'] A short but simple personal experience of fundamental analysis.TER Teradyne a fantastic ROIC stock last year. I bought before earnings and made a good profit. It had positive momentum too.Now just recently it shit the bed after earnings came out
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 05:15:52'] Possibly a better question is does it matter enough today (or on any given day) with regards to how a stock is priced? That said I invest in index funds so technically in the very, very long term I believe that the market makes sense. Kind of.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 06:18:44'] They certainly matter for a lot of it investors. To me it separates the risk level of a stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 06:37:06'] Fundamentals in the long run ALWAYS mater. Because Bull markets don’t last forever and Choppy ame Bear markets last longer then most new investors think.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 06:42:01'] Fundamental Analysis is like an MRI a doctor might use while technical Analysis is like using a thermometer before the process. The stocks temperature is more like its volume , has it had a breakout or massive volume day with news, did it gap up or down.IMO Everything else related to the chart is 50-50.The temperature could rise because the stock was pumped or dumped and got excited, even with good or bad fundamentals, not all stocks trade the same with volume, some stocks have sense memory.Fundamentals are like using an MRI- it is more accurate as a clear visual of what your body aka the stock is doing with any issue you can spot aka bad management, weak sector, bad Roe. I Use both but fundamentals are everything in my 16 years of investing, as a dr. can't tell much if your temp is high. But his MRI can tell you just about everything for the most part as the dr. will talk to the patient and ask them questions , This last part is key. Investors can do the same for the stock and management. Easy to do but few people take the time to do it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 06:43:34'] The best thing about fundamentals is when the majority is screaming “fundamentals don’t matter” is that it’s the surest sign the markets are about a 12 to 18’months from the top
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 06:56:59'] Probably in the long run yes but short term is all based on macroeconomic and government policy. Hard for a company with low debt, good cash flow, and growth opportunities to go bankrupt long term but stock could go down heavy for no other reason other than people panic selling everything, and that's when you buy
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:00:23'] Is this a serious question?  You mustMean in regards to short term trading. Fundamental analysis just means is the company good or is the company bad.  Like if a company is a crap company avoid it, if a company is a great company invest in it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:45:39'] If nothing else- it could help a person identify an obvious loser stock. If I can rule out obvious loser stocks- I have a better chance of picking a winner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:51:25'] So called quacks drum up stuff saying fundamentals out the window saying shit like cup and saucer; they want you sit on the candle stick because they want you to trade often and loose more. Fundamentals always matter. Buy good companies, keep an eye on their quarterly and annual reports and know what management is doing and in the long run you will be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:53:01'] They (the folks swearing by their FA/TA) might as well be reading tea leaves or talking to an astrologist to make their predictions. The amount of pseudoscience and superstition in short term stock trading is staggering but not actually all that surprising given the type of mindset that would be attracted to a "get rich quick" approach to finances.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 07:59:13'] Everything reverts to fundamentals. Technicals is worthless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:05:20'] In the long term, yes. In the short term, not always.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:16:04'] I bought oatly at 20€.Well didnt know there was fraud involved but man that money burned fast
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:23:40'] Unpopular opinion here but no. If we were scientists or engineers modeling system dynamics then yes. But we’re playing a game of betting on future perception of current systems. Those systems will fundamentally change. How do you model a ball rolling downhill of the ball might turn into a balloon or the hill disappears? You can get some short term signals into market behaviors (other people making decisions based on lines and numbers) and it isn’t like the information you glean is worthless. It just is far outweighed by the inherent noise in the system especially as we extrapolate for the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:24:21'] First off, it takes a long time to grow to a million even if you pick winners most of the time. This leads the impatient to chase the new shiny thing hoping to accelerate the process. Second, I see so often investors not including growth as a fundamental, "xxxx stock has been around 100 years, no way the younger, up-and-comer with exploding revenue and margins ever beats the old timer".
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:36:40'] Well the concept a stocks price has to be somehow tied to its financial fundamentals is garbage. There's no rule whatsoever that says a stock has to maintain certain financial based statistics however much someone tells you there is. The stock market is 100% driven by the sentiment of the people trading on it. What influences that sentiment the most varies from stock to stock. People don't buy Apple for the same reasons they buy Tesla. Analysis of any kind is actually analysis of sentiment. That's why TA works. Fundamentals may not actually matter if people decide they don't. But if people decide they do then they do. Buying a solid stock that's currently considered undervalued is useful because there's other people doing the same thing for the same reasons. On the flip side shorting a stock just because you consider it overvalued can be very dangerous if it's investors aren't determining its value based on financial fundamentals. TLDR: yes and no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:44:16'] So we just randomly picking stocks for no reason then
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 08:55:52'] My opinion:People have myriads of reason to buy or sell.Usually these reasons are only important to the stock price when the decision-maker moves large amounts of money, or when a large number of decision-makers are captured by the same sentiment, leaning more towards selling or buying.In the first case: Big market makers usually dont handle their own money, but other peoples money. So they have to hedge for the case they dont make much or even lose money - and fundamentals are the best rationalization. But insofar they feel compelled to have a good justification in place, to that degree they base their decision really on p/e etc. But you can justify also by pointing to a widely known brand, e.g.In the second case, fundamentals are more often used as rationalization after the fact rather than really influence decisions in the first place. The same fundamentals can produce vastly different market reactions based on overall sentiment, influenced by politics, natural catastrophes or even just big sports events. Bottom line: Fundamentals do most of the time set "boundaries" for price movements and p/e-ranges relative to a given general sentiment. In this sense deviations from this broader range are an exception - but they also occur, see insane valuations like Teslas.It just has fans, so fundamentals dont matter at all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:09:03'] everyone has the same data, but only a few can interpret them in a way that makes sense. you can have all the data from bloomberg, morning star and still don’t understand anything
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:09:48'] That's a really naive way of looking at the market. It certainly matters but some things become detached from fundamentals at times.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:27:54'] It does. All my picks which I have both long term and short term trading positions on that have good fundamentals tend to see a steady price rise despite any volatility. All that show the fundamentals to be sketchy or something is wrong with debt and earnings ratios tend to drop very far eventually even if they have 100%+ in a year gains. You need to know which fundamentals matter most and how relevant they are to the business. You don't compare big banks, industrials, and consumer staples with the same metrics.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:29:19'] Fundamentals don't really matter because at the end of the day the stock market is a supply and demand market place. As long as the stock demand is out-stripping supply prices will go up. We see this with every big crash and every boom. People get optimistic, even if nothing has fundamentally changed, the price shoots up. People get pessimistic prices fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:51:26'] Short term trading - not really. Longterm investing? 100%
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:19:59'] I think it matters to the extent on evaluating how healthy a company is. There are lot of other factors that go into valuing a stock, however.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:21:09'] Absolutely fundamental analysis matters. It’s what separates investing from gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:47:21'] Let’s assume that you have 1B$ of debt. Would I invest in you and your future? Probably not. You might get to be a billionaire in the future. The probability is low tho. So I don’t „bet“ on you becoming a billionaire.Fundamentals impact your investment thesis.If you would have 0$ debt I would likely invest in you and your future. Even if you wouldn’t become rich.Value is the present value of all future free cashflows.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:58:38'] Well yes but actually no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:24:37'] No.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:29:54'] Everyone has the same data but what you do with that is different. Take the DCF model for example, you have to “predict” the future costs, revenues, etc. yea you base it on past data but in the end, it is still a subjective matter. Almost no one reaches the same price target. Fundamentals do matter for long term investors, but there are plenty of other strategies that are for more short term - momentum, event-driven, etc. if these didn’t work then there wouldn’t be hedge funds centered around them. So in the end it depends on what your trading strategy is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 14:33:07'] Fundamentals can keep you away from the risky and/or terribly run companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 15:10:39'] Fundamental analysis is the only thing that matters in the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 15:50:25'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 16:35:36'] "... fact that everyone has the same data" Correction: everyone in this sub THINKS everyone else is seeing the same data. Also, wouldn't this make "technical analysis" even more useless? because we can be certain that everyone IS looking at the same charts lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:28:43'] Not in this market
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:29:53'] Buy a fundamentally sound company stock, if it goes down and nothing changed about the business. Be thankful you are getting a discount! This is the part people forget! People sell because all they see is the loss. They Forget about the reason why they bought the stock!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:35:58'] IMHO, “fundamentals don’t matter” is repeated constantly by people who think “P/E and EBITDA” constitutes fundamental analysis.A stock is a share in a company that entitles you to voting rights, distribution of dividends (depending on company structure) and other things. Ultimately, it’s value is based on returns and risk. People just like simple things. High PE bad. Low PE good. High growth good. Slowing growth bad. But analyzing fundamentals of a business is a lot more in depth than that.Now — to be fair, your friend’s statement that the public access to fundamentals, combined with efficient market hypothesis, may mean that capturing alpha is a fools errand for retail (or even most institutions) by use of fundamentals. That I’m not confident about. I don’t know.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:58:52'] I think fundamentals matter but there are just a lot more factors and considerations than there used to be. There is simply a lot of information out there, more than there used to be, and there are a ton of factors influencing stock movement. For example, to undertake analysis of a stock, you now need to be able to analyse media, news coverage, cultural aspects etc. Bots now analyse entire news databases and make market decisions based on that - which will ultimately affect your stock. Is media analysis considered fundamental now? I think it should be. But most don't do it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 19:37:05'] put it this way: stocks almost always hit their "fair value" at SOME point or another, however, it is never guaranteed if/when they will hit that value and for how long it will be at that price, so fundamentals are not "useless" per se, it's just that you never know when they will actually matter to the market.. just think of all the stocks that were "overvalued" for years and then covid hit and suddenly everything dropped to extremely "undervalued", then look at all the stocks that were "overvalued" since the market started recovering from covid and then this most recent correction brought them back down to "fair value" or "undervalued" again.. and on the other hand, look at all the stocks that were "undervalued" for years and it wasn't until some breakthrough or a big event that they skyrocketed to well above their "fair value".. the point is fundamentals DO matter in the sense that they tell you what the stock is ACTUALLY worth and they will probably reach that value EVENTUALLY, however, fundamentals DON'T matter in the sense that the market values stocks well outside the range of their actual value literally all the time.. and the reason not everyone is a millionaire even with the same information is because of a) human emotions and b) everyone trying to get rich quick and time the market rather than sticking to a profitable plan
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 21:15:59'] The point of Fanal (fundamental analysis) is generally used to see if a ticker is worth holding.  Think of it in terms with your friend coming to you with a business idea.  When you look over their numbers to see of its worth investing in said friend, that's your Fanal.Investors may use Tanal (technical analysis) for gauging overall performance and trend.  You can add your T/Fanal together for confirmation bias.  This is in a very generic sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 21:28:16'] Fundamental analysis is straight forward, numbers and assumptions. It’s hard but the easier method vs qualitative analysis.The real money is getting it right about the macro trend, the company leadership, and the ability to understand a company’s strategic position and their pole position. Sometimes even inspite of the company’s valuation beyond the fundamentals, due to that positionz
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 21:46:54'] Nobody gives a shit about fundamentals in a bull market. Everyone only seems to care about fundamentals when the stock is down
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:04:55'] Street Value is King

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:50:28'] Bull market: doesn’t matterBear market: matter a lot
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:55:17'] Fundamental analysis matters. It's true, everyone has the same data, but a big chunk of market participants don't look at it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 08:42:39'] Go look at the most successful investors over the last 30-50 years.  The question answers itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 09:54:11'] It just gives a conviction. Fundamentals are narratives for justifying value of securities. Under no circumstances, share prices have to reflect fundamentals in both long or short term. Fundamentals also don't tell when to buy or sell much. It gives very lagging entry and exit signals unless someone can foresee disaster by reading cashflow statements
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 02:49:18'] Despite what some morons in this sub tell you, no, it doesn't matter because there's a million ways to interpret it and you won't be able to gain any edge whatsoever.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 03:37:30'] Data is data. Statistics and calculus the mathematical process to determine the significance of any detectable patterns so one can have a positive expectation over time.Example? It has been determined that low P/E companies outperform high P/E companies.  The price and eps are data, and it was statistics that determined how the pattern worked.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 05:28:56'] imo superifical FA matters in terms of determining e.g profits, earnings etc is generally a good predictor of what will be around. The longer something is around, the more likely it is to appreciate in price, provided demand for its shares stays constant or increases. demand for shares is something that changes.Most people are not going through quarterlies, sales, and coming up with actual estimates for their eps year over year. if they were theyd have an edge, assuming theyve been consistently accurate. analysts doing this will likely have positions set before releasing their estimates to the public.for your every day joe, id say your edge comes from risk management. w.e FA you do, youll probably end up 50/50, finding more success in bull markets and less during all else. look at everyone who bought into those hyped companies with their FA or ARKK. just pull up all the DD on those hyped companies and if you were to question them on it at the time, theyd probably come up with some forecast about revenue,fcf,, or w.e well today theyve likely lost 50-70% of their bet.what will guarantee success is risk management snd recognize what is and what isnt within your control.Am I genius for only buying the spy etf 10 years ago or a triple leveraged one? sure in hindsight.people like to believe their skills separates them from everyone else, that their analysis is something special, and that these shares actually give them something from the business (they dont. if the company goes bust, you will have no claim to any asset).
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:25:13'] You can't invest solely based on numbers, there are a lot of qualitative, social, psychological, and artistic aspects to consider. This coming from an actuary with a masters in math and finance.

POST_TEXT: b'As 2021 comes to an end through a bumpy last few weeks but an overall good EOY growth on the SPY and Nasdaq, I am wondering what your speculative, through research and DD of course, growth stocks are for the coming year. Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\nI am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.\n\nSoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nIm also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year. In 2022, venmo, owned by paypal, is coming to amazon which is exciting news!\n\nWhat are your thought'

Personally I am a huge believer that oil producers will perform great in 2022. Especially a lot of smaller Canadian companies break even at $40 a barrel and gush cash at current price levels. Some would be able to buy back all oustanding shares in 2 years if oil just remains at current levels. With continued supply restraints and questionable opec reserves, there is a lot of room for upside.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 08:20:43'] My advice is to get out of all of those stocks and DCA into a general market fund. Then, read some books on investing, starting with Richer, Wiser, Happier. It’s a great book to get you into a good mindset for investing. Edit: If you’re not going to get out of all those, at least get out of PILL.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 11:56:44'] You should have never expected a boost from PFE for a vaccine, the stock price has been mostly flat for years. PFE are a gigantic company, around a billion from the government to make a vaccine they will never profit from long-term is almost meaningless to PFE. If you want a vaccine play look at BNTX, but certainly don't hope for a big change with PFE.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-28 08:04:07'] From what I understand MPX can remain on surfaces for longer durations than covid. I was listening to the radio where the guests were discussing two patients who were under observation  in quarantine at hospital. Apparently the guests were part of the team monitoring the patients. Anyway, they were discussing how viral loads were found everywhere the patient had touched with the heaviest viral load on door knobs and in the bathroom. Considering there's a large subset of Americans who resist hygiene and public health measures as an assault on their freedom to be dirty and ignorant, it's reasonable to imagine monkey pox becoming a greater health challenge than covid - very quickly.

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-02 07:44:44'] WTF does "may work"? suppose to mean?   We still haven't had a single death from Omicron. So what's up with this bs headline. Is the media, pharmaceutical companies and FDA this broken that they have to pump non-news? "May work"   Does doing nothing count as a "may work" as well? Since doing nothing apparently works pretty well as we haven't had a single Omicron death.

What stocks to buy in case there\'s a crash? Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for \'crash\' or \'bubble\', you\'ll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.\n\nOf course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. "Scared money don\'t make money", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 03:38:35'] I think there is too much covid exhaustion. People will just live there lives spending money at this point and everybody will either get exposed and develope antibodies or they'll die, but people are going to go out to beaches, restaurants, sporting events and concerts regardless. There's no way people will tolerate another lockdown in my opinion. Even the governments seem over it. Overall the next 3 or 4 quarters will be steadily up, until rates start getting more and more talked about getting tweaked.I have hedged against the moratorium ending in the United States tho. I'm targeting commercial real estate puts prioritizing small and mid caps. Mostly puts around a November expiration at give or take -7%.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 06:09:48'] Those countries that were initially successful in holding off the virus, but are now dealing with outbreaks, made the mistake of not vaccinating their population with the same urgency as others like the US and Israel.I only follow the situation in Taiwan and Australia, and both of them had 1% vaccination rate when outbreaks hit them.Just because you were able to mostly keep it out initially, doesn’t mean you’re home safe. Now a more dangerous variant appears and 99% of your population has zero immunity to it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 04:36:23'] “You don’t get a warning before the rug gets pulled out from under your feet”. Meanwhile you are predicting a crash. So you are simultaneously claiming that there’s never evidence that a crash will come and yet you are predicting a crash. Therefore your prediction of a crash isn’t based on any actual evidence if we assume what you wrote is true.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-03 02:54:45'] Problem is the market crash was due to the reaction to covid, not the disease itself. Market won't crash cause you are sick. It crashes cause the business shut down after the government made them. The U.S. has too many vaccinations now for the government to react to covid with a shutdown. Biden already said there will be no more lockdowns. Not that he's in charge of it, but the main reason they did so easily before was to get rid of fat guy. There's about no chance they shutdown anything now that they are in power. Just like the country didn't shutdown under Obama with H1N1 with 61 million infected and 274,000 hospitalizations. Anyway, if covid comes back it will mostly impact other countries that don't have the vaccines and protections in place. This might hurt the world economy, but problem is when there is a world crisis the money will flow into the United States market as a safe haven. No, the risk to the market is actually after covid goes away and things return to normal. Covid is and has always propped up the market to new highs. The only thing that hurt the market was forced business shutdown which causes a liquidity crisis cause businesses had their reserve capital in corporate bonds which they couldn't sell to anyone during a panic. That's why the Fed has to step in to be the buyer. That's why currently we are in a "Goldilocks" environment, cause we are right in in-between covid reduction and reopening. So you get the best of both worlds, massive spending from covid stimulus spending and companies open for business. It's basically a planned economy with massive central bank spending that guarantees an outcome. Once covid is gone and stimulus is gone, whenever or if ever, then the market will be in some hurt.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 07:55:26'] This is getting out of hand. Every one of these posts say “I know we are seeing this everywhere right now but here is my opinion on it also.” No one is adding anything new at this point. The last new data point I saw was repo rate. This is the market. Invest or don’t. I think most people agree the market is overvalued but there is always opportunity somewhere. If you need to take a break, do so. I don’t think the fear mongering serves any purpose. Crashes require a catalyst. Until the catalyst happens the bubble will continue. Predicting a catalyst is near impossible unless you have unique information.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 02:32:52'] Tldr: me see article about big crash. Me scared. Anyone who says they know when the next crash just wants your money. The market is not going to crash in the next 8 weeks. Will there be a small correction in the next few months? Probably, no one knows. Earnings are going to once again show big companies are money printing machines and spy will only go up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 01:20:02'] If delta gets that bad the market will moon like we’ve never seen before. No one is selling stocks because of Covid anymore. That was a one time thing specific to February-March 2020. Those who got shook out when Covid first hit are not going to do that again.

Could be super fun.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 06:29:23'] Needless to say, at least in the case of the US, the ship sailed a long time ago on another full on crash that is directly due to COVID.I've got swampland for you if you think anybody is actually going to listen in this country on lockdowns. Doesn't rule out that you could see a change in approach because of worries over COVID. But that playbook has been seen already and ran at times after March last year. It's called "because of strength from the Nasdaq, not much else matters," and if you don't think it can't continue, you haven't been paying attention.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 02:20:08'] March 2020 had little to do with Covid. The Repo market broke down when a massive amount of off the run treasuries got offloaded, everything after that was knock on effects. Was it offloaded due to covid fears? Maybe, you’d need to find an international banker and ask him what happened.I’m still waiting for the moratoriums to expire. A wave of defaults could definitely spur a crash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 07:09:04'] The big thing from last Feb was the unexpectedness of how bad Covid would get. Now that we’ve had Covid for more than a year, scientists and the markets are able to understand it a bit better.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 07:10:46'] Despite the Delta variant and infection spikes in certain places, the virus is WAY MORE under control than in was last year. It's not even close. I predict that numbers will continue to plateau for a while, but anyone saying that we're going back to lockdowns is fear mongering.And you can't really compare the market conditions of March 2020 to now. During the huge selloff, no one knew what was going to happen. We still knew almost nothing about the virus, and governments hadn't started fiscal stimulus yet. The selloff priced in way more economic damage than actually happened.I believe the next financial crisis will be caused by excessive debt levels, and will play out differently than previous crashes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 07:36:47'] Man I love how much energy people put into explaining that it makes PERFECT SENSE a crash is coming in the next X weeks. Nobody gets it right lol. And even if some random dude got it right it'd be the 50th time he'd be predicting the crash.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 07:58:27'] Nice read-up, but consider investing in a few stocks to hedge against a crash rather than pulling money completely. Tech stocks, vaccine stocks will both get a boost from bad news with the delta variant front, while stocks like gold and silver can hedge against inflationWhatever your thesis, you should be able to identify a couple of hedge stocks so you don't have to completely withdraw from the market

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 08:16:07'] With the internet and higher financial education of the plebs, we all know how to buy the dip now. Sometimes I wonder if crashes like last year will continue to rebound as fast as last year.This environment is crazy, but where else are you going to park your money? Real estate made a bull run, commodities made a bull run, the fed is printing like crazy (so don’t hold cash), and good luck with buying 10 year notes (1.5% is under the inflation rate). Fed tapering will hinder the markets, but I’m not sure a crash is coming. Maybe just more sideways or choppy moves.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 09:09:29'] I doubt there is going to be a crash that soon. Although I wouldn't rule out a 10% correction in that timeframe.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 14:07:20'] My 2 cents as somebody knowledgeable in the field: viruses that are less symptomatic tend to be more successful in spreading, so it's more probable that newer strains will be faster spreading but less threatening. Oc it's not always the case, but it should.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 14:15:30'] Let me guess, and when the stock market is crashing you will continue to stay out because your afraid it’s going to keep dropping.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-03 14:44:16'] OP, I respect this analysis a lot since it has been on my mind for quite some time.  However, instead of completely pulling out of the market. I invest in assets that will thrive in volatile market and some even have crash insurance such as NUSI. If you worry about a crash, you might want to look into these assets: NUSI, ETJ, SWAN, ISWN, etc... These assets won't go up as fast as SP500 but they allows you to participate partially in the upside and protect you against the downside. That's to me is win-win.  I also started diversifying International as much as possible. I noticed that recently International has a drop so good chance to buy in. Crisis normally hits other countries first before it comes crashing down our shores. US situation right now is similar to a kid stuffing toys down the toilet and once something is stuck, all the shits gonna come out and you gonna get owned.  However, with some skepticism, I still recommend to hedge your bets and stay invested rather than completely pull out. The reason why pulling out might be even more foolish is because of all these money printing and trillion dollars of stimulus causing your money to lose value faster than you think.  There are also nothing else to invest in, let's see:  Cash: worthless  Real Estates: an even bigger bubble than the stock market  Virtual Currency: look into tether scandal, it gonna blow up this speculative market  Gold & Silver: the price movements look heavily manipulated. Inflation shoots through the roof and price of these metals go down or flat  Bond: with 0.00001% interest rate ? Fuck that  The only thing left is stock market. You get what I am trying to say...Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 22:50:51'] Just going to post this in a separate commentALPHA: R0 = 4, effectiveness of the vaccine = 90%+, assume 80% of people jabbed.e.g. 4 * 0.1 / 0.8 = 0.5You get a revised R around 0.5 without any other measures. R<1 means the disease shrinks every day.Disease disappears globally rapidly even without masks or distancing etc.DELTA: R0 = 6, effectiveness of the vaccine = 70%, assume 100% of people jabbed (very difficult to achieve!).e.g. 6 * 0.3 / 1.0 = 1.8Disease does not collapse.Virus persists going round the population repeatedly infecting about the same frequency as flu (1.5-2).Virus gets billions of continued opportunities over many years to mutate further to evade the immune system or higher R0.That 1.8 number is the problem and that assumes a) every single person gets vaccinated b) vaccine effectiveness is maintained around 70%.Those are both hilariously optimistic at present. We would need a new vaccine that specifically protects against delta at a level over 90%, jabbed in everyone's arms, just to reset the clock back to March/April 2021.Meantime, delta is not going to wait around, it has a large number of lottery tickets to improve and push up R higher, or push down vaccine effectiveness lower. It's being allowed to circulate in some countries with vaccination (UK, US, EU) which means it will be continually probing and prodding at people with vaccines till it finds a way round.This nightmare may go on for years and years. And the more people insist they're going back to everyday life regardless of what the government says, the bigger the problem gets.Yet the market is priced as though things are already far better than they were in 2019, pre-covid.Total insanity!

POST_TEXT: b'**Summary**\n\nThe three day rally in the stock market took a pause, with stocks finishing mostly lower. Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot neutralizes the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/o'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 22:08:38'] Here is some research I have compiled.- Pfizer is working not only on more mRNA treatments, but many other kinds. You can see here the number of Phase 3 trials [in their pipeline document](https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/product-pipeline/Pipeline_Update_08FEB2022.pdf?1LyL7HgKeLza5jVNXvCDNKZhykNz2IGT). They have between 25-30 drugs in each of the Phases (1, 2, and 3), and then 10 in the final 'registration' step. This adds up to a total of 89 drugs in some type of late stage clinical trial. Merck has about 30 drugs as well in Phase 3, but a much larger 79 in Phase 2. But Merck also didn't successfully benefit from Covid-19 like Pfizer. Both have similar P/E ratios.- Their P/E ratio is extremely cheap: 7.7 trailing, 12 forward; the sector median is 21.- They are constantly coming up with new collaborations, like using genetic editing to treat diseases. For example, there is a recent collaboration with BEAM pharmaceuticals [(Source)](https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-triple-partners-for-future-mrna-vaccines-and-genetic-medicines-/). Moreover, "PFE has bolstered its pipeline by multiple acquisitions such as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Array BioPharma, Therachon, and Trillium Therapeutics Inc since 2019." Source: a SA link I cannot post.- Free Cash Flow (FCF) is substantial, yielding more money to spend in R&D, share buybacks, dividends, and investments. "Sales of its COVID-19 vaccine have provided a windfall of cash for Pfizer over the past 12 months. In 2020 and 2019, the healthcare giant accumulated $11.6 billion and $10 billion in free cash flow, respectively. But over the past four quarters, its free cash flow surged to $29.2 billion."  The FCF figure of 29.2 billion is a third of Apple's FCF of 93 billion, for comparison. [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/12/3-growth-stocks-that-have-generated-179-billion-in/)- Moderna, by comparison: "Moderna had 14 non-Covid drugs in its pipeline as of a few months ago, one of which is late-stage. Pfizer has 100, 25 of which are late stage. Moderna is too Covid-dependent." [This is quoting a comment I made a long time ago, but I don't remember where I sourced that statistic.]My takeaways are: It's a very cheap stock; there is a lot more to it than Covid, although it will continue to reap benefits from it; it has tons of cash to spend; Covid demonstrated their innovative ability, not to mention their past history of success.Risk: they seem to have a patent cliff in 2024, but their robust pipeline makes this less worrisome. Also, mRNA vaccines may not be successful, since I believe a fundamental problem with this type of technology is poor longevity, compared to traditional DNA vaccines. [I need to recheck this again.]
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 17:06:20'] >Do you think Pfizer is undervalued right now due to incorrect interpretation of future vaccine and anti-viral drug sale projections?I believe Pfizer is trading at a very slight premium due to an incorrect interpretation from the market of COVID related sales going into late 2022 and, more importantly, 2023-2025. I expect such a revenue to actually taper off, not grow, sharply.>More a more general level, do you think Pfizer is going to wisely invest its covid windfall and develop great revenue streams?I think Pfizer already has invested some of the COVID related profits wisely, though they remain behind the industry average for R&D investments if I'm remembering right. Pfizer sports 89 products on their pipeline, ten of which in the process of being registered (5 COVID related).>Do you consider Pfizer a great buy or not? Is this a long term hold? The pe ratio is 13. Is that considered normal for drug companies?1. I think, despite saying earlier it's trading at a premium, it's still a decent *investment.* I'd wait before pulling the trigger though.2. Yes, Pfzier is a long term hold. Aside from sporting a healthy dividend TTM 3.04% yield (39.69% payout ratio), which is already attractive to me, Pfizer has a substantial stable moat in the Healthcare space. A diversified product catalogue and no patents expiring till 2028 (Eliquis comes to mind) alongside a strong distribution network all help to keep it's pricing power for drugs in the company's favor.3. Pfizer's p/e ratio of 15.83 (where did you get 13?) is fairly competitive with other companies in the industry. Similar to other companies like $NVS and $MRK that I'd recommend to others for due diligence research.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 18:01:58'] Overly dramatic sell-off imo.I am expecting a lot more than 22B for Paxlovid sales in 2022. Also remember that the shelf life of Paxlovid is around 3 years. Countries will want a ready healthy supply in case of future variants and to avoid overcrowding of hospitals.>(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it expects 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral pill to top $54 billion, but that fell short of lofty Wall Street estimates and its shares were off about 3%.  >  >Still, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said final sales for its oral COVID-19 antiviral, Paxlovid, could be “way bigger” than what Pfizer has forecast since its current outlook **only included contracts that have been or are close to being signed.**  >  >Pfizer currently expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment, compared with Wall Street estimates of $22.88 billion.  >  >"Clearly, this is only a fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture" this year, Bourla told analysts on a conference call.  >  >The company is selling 20 million courses of Paxlovid to the United States at around $530 a course, but Bourla said that was a special price because of the size of the order.  >  >The price for most high income countries, he said, would be more or less in line with the price of Merck & Co’s rival treatment molnupiravir, which the U.S. government bought for around $700 a course.  >  >**Pfizer executives said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to top 120 million courses if needed.**
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 15:09:02'] I bought the dip yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 16:59:26'] The article doesn't make much sense.First it says guidance is only relying on sales already made. Guidance is forward looking, not backwards looking.Second, regardless of revenue, they are still guiding down on vaccines. Who cares about revenue when they are missing guidance? Am I misreading something here?Edit: Looked up the article. Apparently Pfizer is breaking with all tradition in not using future estimates to guide future estimates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 20:37:15'] Honestly I held Pfizer for 3.5 months and it was a pretty reliable stock vs the markets at large. Got out at 12% up pre-earnings because nothing really moves the stock and I wanted to free up the cap. Solid fundamentals, low beta, much govt. backing from multiple countries, would buy again for an actual long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 14:57:36'] I’m bullish on Pfizer. This is a $60 stock easy just based on current revenues. When a new variant hits in the fall having more of this stock in your portfolio will at least cushion the blow.In the meantime, the dividend and solid floor provide protection.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 16:05:27'] Where's the dude who wants to constantly short this stock because of the coming red wave?I'm bullish but not because of vaccine revenues as much as the longer term pipeline of drugs, and any future treatments coming out of the Covid technological developments.

Few of my stocks were down 10% in the morning then reversed and ended up 15% -> over 25% daily range. Just insane stuff.Debt ceiling can't be used as a pretext to fuck with the market till \~2023. The next Covid variants should have weaker effect on the market.There's still inflation and supply chain, and some China evergrande, but better outlook for now.

The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded.

In the case of ABBV, the patent expiration of Humira did not hurt as much as expected, and the acquisition of Allergan produced stronger revenue growth than predicted.     This caused the market to conclude that these guys must know what they're doing, and the stock took off like a rocket.  They're still a good company , but IMO the big boost from this is behind them.   You can collect a nice dividend, but the stock probably won't double again.     What you want to find, what everyone should be looking for, is a stock that the market looks down on that is going to outperform expectations.   Those are not easy to identify.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 07:44:52'] Most analysts believe it is a good buy. However, it seems to have lost some momentum. At this price it is more likely a stock on your watch list.  Paying peak price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 07:30:13'] and why ABT isnt
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 11:09:27'] It and ABT are sort of my defensive stocks in portfolio. Will sell them when I believe this dip is over n buy some beaten stocks.Got ABBV shares when it split from ABT, so I probably getting a 10%+ dividend.Risk, I think if anything small negative happens, it will go down 20% easy, while ABT is more stable n safe play

POST_TEXT: b"Looks like I bought MRNA close to the peak at 148.  Been steady down since, now I'm wondering if all the upside from the vaccine is already priced in and the glow is wearing off.  Wondering if I should just cut bait on it?"
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 14:53:41'] It was priced in when the stock was 80 dollars. The only thing MRNA has is the one vaccine and a quarter of the production capacity of PFE. Look at what has happened to PFE since emergency approval. If you have made a profit, get out.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 18:44:43'] I think a majority of the vaccine revenue is priced into MRNA what people keep forgetting is this proves their mRNA platform and provides more validity to the rest of their existing pipeline which will drive the stock price higher.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 20:15:23'] That is as high as they get. Cf PFE stock price.  Unless other news will affect them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 20:31:03'] Well, the question here is what comes next, the platform is unlimited in potential, and they will be flush with tons of money and will have won a super bowl in their rookie season.   Moderna is the next Tom Brady.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 10:01:02'] I think Moderna is done. This is all they have ever dome and all they may ever do. I’d cut ties and get in something that looks good for recovery and has a dividend.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 09:05:25']  We can hit stat sig for primary if we beat SOC+placebo arm by just 20 patients.  Switching to vent free survival was an absolute Boss maneuver by management.  I think with vent-free survival as a target... we could see a difference as high as 30-40 patients between the two study arms.

Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket shipsLook, I know shorters have a bad rep and screwed up recently, but fundamentally this is not good news. It means people who generally have a decent understanding of the firm and the industry are willing to bet on a decline at substantial risk to their capital. I don't understand the pharma industry well enough to comment on the firm and its prospects, but please be aware that high short interest isn't just bonus money to be made.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 06:35:20'] Agree with you on HGEN being a good short term play but I'm betting on the opposite. It has a huge downside  but no immediate upside: if trial fails, price tanks immediately; if trial succeeds, there are still other obstacles before the drug can get to the customers. In other words, the risk is lopsided. I'm buying puts on this one. Or maybe a strangle, we will see.A different story if this were a long term play though. But maybe this isn't the best time to get in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 05:33:09'] What good is DD if it looks at everything through rose colored glasses? Are you trying to \*determine\* if it's a good company to buy, or are you just trying to \*convince\* yourself it's a good company to buy? Most drugs don't make it to market. Current mRNA vaccines are doing a very good job with COVID variants (despite what OP says). Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines result in far fewer serious symptoms of infection (i.e. reduced need for this drug). Other drugs are currently available to help suppress the cytokine storm. OP doesn't mention any of this. Is there big upside? Possibly. Is it already factored into share price? Probably to some extent but I doubt there's 5x-10x upside. It's not like COVID drugs are flying under the radar. If the drug isn't approved be ready to baghold at $2.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 09:27:56'] Unpopular opinion:  Most "technical analysis" is bullshit.  Especially RSI.Take a look at AMZN chart from last year.  RSI was 71.6 on April 14th.  Overbought right?  Should probably sell right?  Except the stock kept moving up and up and up despite the RSI being consistently in the 70s and at times the 80s.  The stock moved up 5 more months despite the RSI saying it was overbought in April.If you would have sold in April you would have missed out on a massive bull run.  Long story short...don't base your trades on things like RSI or you will miss out on huge profits.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 08:54:14'] I also use RSI and others like MACD to look for technical entry points. For the long term it probably doesn't make much of a difference but I think it's a good spot check not to jump in at the top. This market is just eerily familiar to 1999-2000, and even 2005-2007, at least to me. Still, I buy and hold stocks, though I try to steer clear of absurdly priced issues. Most of my portfolio is in cash and bonds for now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 13:21:18'] msft is on the list, I am holding. Amzn is not on the listing, I am holding. In conclusion, keep holding.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 09:14:56'] I've noticed the same thing -- I use RSI and MACD as additional confirmation indicators, but sometimes it seems a stock (especially a new 'hot' one can ride above that 70 easily for a week or more.   When I see that, I consider it to be the "new 70" if it continues to trade that way.  The RSI does adjust to that new trading level over time does it not (ie, does the indicator adjust for that price level over time)?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 10:14:12'] I don’t find RSI to be a particularly helpful indicator, especially when you are already scanning a list of top performers. Everyone knows we’re in a bubble, but it’s unclear how it can end. The fed’s plan is hyperinflation/stagflation. Everything is a sacrifice to prop the market up, because it’s the only thing they can point to and say “see the economy is actually good”.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 15:10:52'] When people pumped more money in the market the last 5 months than the last 12 years, a lot of stuff are overvalued and overbought.  The case of that market deli can attest to that.  Right I am seeing a lot of correction albeit more gradually than sharply like the last 2 months.  I think most of those money already rotated to blue chips and index .  The new money are going mostly to Crypto.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 12:35:16'] You are focusing on form not function my man, you need to go back to first principals. TA is for *finding* the pattern that whales of the day are using, not for fitting the lines to your preferred indicator. This is basic data analysis. RSI and MACD are fairly useless, simple moving averages are your time tested friend for entry/exit. Beyond that the golden rule is don't get greedy, take your profits when they become meaningful.

If you look though, even Buffett said it's not the only indicator to use.We will most likely remain overbought for at least half the year before any kind of major downturn.  It's more likely the fundamentals will catch up to the price rather than the price going down to the fundamentals.

Like, OLD, an ETF related to senior living management, or more broadly in a biotech ETFs or mutual funds (depending on tax situation). Perhaps focus on tech stocks while you learn more about the biotech market.You could also add consumer staples.

POST_TEXT: b'What do you think the best earning plays might be next week. I won last week with Amazon and Google. But lost on Ford.\nWatching both Amazon and Google I saw that it was going down 72 hours before earnings to an extreme point. Shouldve waited until the day of earnings to purchase. I purchased prematurely 48 hours ahead. Couldve had better pricing.\n\nLost 10% on my Ford investment but I know long-term its going to be OK.\n\nI did buy two weeks ago Cleveland-Cliffs when it was about $16.25. Earnings will either exceed todays value or drive it back to $16.25\n\nI am thinking Walmart will be similar to Amazon. Its pulled back from a tire of $145 per share to about $138. It would not surprise me to see it dip to $135 before earnings.  I cant imagine their fourth-quarter being a bad one so it may be worth the opportunity to buy the dip and then sell it after earnings'

Earnings for med tech have been solid, there's a lot of backlog for surgeries and procedures and as omicron cases continue to decrease, operating rooms will start back up. I have friends at huge hospital centers(like Baylor, Einstein, Cleveland) who said that ORs have been shut down, like 1/4 capacity, and despite that med tech has been making impressive revenues and earnings for the most part. I'm not as bullish on pharmaceuticals but still have decent positions in the majors and some biotechs and start ups.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 09:03:34'] Abbvie by far. Before the sickness hit pfizer had years of declining revenue. They are riding high with one event. Long term pfizer doesn't look a good bet. Abbvie finds ways to consistently grow revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 10:17:37'] Abbvie has that much debt? Damn. I think that the most important aspect for stock price is the pipeline and the portfolio. I would own both, and I do, but i own more Pfizer. They're 1) better positioned to capture revenue and grow business in chronic non antibody therapy disease. 2) more adaptable since the pandemic 3) in a better position financially 4) mRNA has more growth potential than antibody therapy due to lack of competition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 17:13:27'] ABBV without question,simply because they are loyal to the shareholders, as well as constantly staying ahead of the game.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 09:07:51'] I’ve got both but more in Pfizer. I like Pfizer because I think the pandemic actually permanently changed the business. Look how fast they were able to move and develop, and they were in a position to outmaneuver rivals in becoming the dominant vaccine company. Not only that, I think people are underestimating the business that will come from Covid being endemic. Their anti-Covid pill could end up delivering beyond expectations. Then there’s the fact that if another variant does become a concern, this stock could spike to $60 again in short order. A lot of potential catalysts here.

POST_TEXT: b"Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.\n\nSupply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.\n\nEquipment.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 10:34:35'] Just invest in TMO
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 09:01:47'] I strongly believe that Biotech is gonna be the next big industry to revolutionise our world and now would be a good time to invest in a long term play. So thanks for the insight here. What company would you say is stable but plowing back most of their cash into innovation for future technologies? Things like neuroprosthetics.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 18:58:48'] Right on. You can think that CRISPR is gonna cure all ailments and diseases in 15 years (which is an ambitious claim - if something sounds like science fiction the reality is often much much more nuanced and has a long way to go), but even if that was true, that doesn’t mean the small companies looking into it now will be around forever. Biotech companies are notoriously difficult to start, don’t return profits for a long time, and are dependent on the FDA, and I’m sure the owners are just hoping to sell to Merck, Pfiszer, etc. once the time is right. Trying to commercialize something that is intrinsically out of your control and left to nature (scientific results) is extremely stressful cause you can do everything completely right for 2 decades and wind up with absolutely nothing. If I started a company like that and it wound up becoming profitable, I wouldn’t start calling myself the new Bill Gates and stick with it. I’d sell to the highest bidder ASAP.Also love what you said about TMO. If there is one constant in my life as a graduate researcher, it is absolutely Thermo Fisher. If there is an option to buy something with Thermo, I will, even if it’s 50% more expensive. Their partnerships with research institutions like mine just make it easier to order from them than from competitors. Don’t even need to use a purchasing card - it’s all in the system. And they sell almost everything. They’re not going anywhere and if biotech grows, a small biotech company might not, but Thermo sure will. Cause almost every single item that went into conducting every experiment was probably purchased through Thermo or Sigma. And they are the masters of upchargjng for items, but have a customer base that cares less about being upcharged because “that’s just how it is in science.”
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 18:31:48'] Pharmacology grad student. I like BIO and TMO
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-23 08:28:13'] You're hugely simplifying the supply chain side of things. VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them. Corning and BD, as well as brands owned by Thermo like Pyrex and Nalgene, are big in lab plastics and glassware. For chemicals, in addition to Fisher and J.T. Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  I'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition). Mettler Toledo definitely deserves a mention for scales, pipets (Rainin is one of their brands), and pH meters. Sartorius also makes equipment of larger scale for manufacturing. There's also a ton of more niche equipment made by more specialized brands.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-23 13:22:28'] I work in biotech, my facility buys from, collaborates with, and even provides to multiple of the companies you mentioned. My advice? Don't invest in biotech. Don't get me wrong, the whole sector wouldn't exist if capital investors didn't give us money to make and do incredible things for the biomedical field, but investing here is nothing more than putting your money in a slot machine. For the average retail investor, you'll lose 99% of the time, it just is not worth the gamble. I myself manage several projects/collaborations with multiple companies, we get approached by probably 6-12 companies EVERY YEAR who want to use our facility/collaborate/do clinical trials/etc and maybe 1 a year is truly in a position to take the next step. Even the companies that have all their shit together, all their ducks in a row, capital backing, basic research done, advisers and connections in the field...maybe 10% of them actually succeed and make it past phase 2. &#x200B;Biotech is a huge future for every single person on this planet, in reality the vast majority of the human population will directly benefit from advances in biotech made over the last 30 years and the future 50+ years. But investing in biotech will more than likely make you a loser.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 12:48:57'] Hard disagree.TAK, BEAM, TMO, AZN, CRSP, PFE, VRTX... All doing revolutionary biotech work. All up between 100 and 600+% over the past five years. Yes, they dip, because progress and news of new products are staggered and sporadic. I'm long on most of the above. Not all biopharm stocks are the same, and shouldn't be bunched together in one generic post like this. Some provide everyday biopharm products/services (VWR, TMO), others are making leaps and bounds in scientific progress that are essential to our future in health, but come with a little unpredictability as to when the next price leap is going to come. Think of the changes to regulations around stem cells, the new existence of mRNA vaccines, psychodelics to treat mental illness... It's not if, but when.Biopharma and Biotech are not going away anytime soon. They are all growing, expanding their product lines, and producing new health tech/drugs/therapeutics continuously. You don't see what's happening behind closed doors unless you're on the inside, but the earnings from each of these have had positive outputs for a while.After 2020, I can't think of a better industry to be long on besides medical research and healthcare.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 08:08:31'] Check out their serious capacity constraints. They had promised capacity of 150 million doses per month by the end of the year, they have only managed to deliver 5 million so far. Markets rewards execution, not a solid product alone.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 09:44:13'] Some reasoning I've seen is that the Omicron variant spreads through populations quickly, hasn't been as deadly, and fewer people need urgent care which keeps hospitals from being overloaded. The market may be pricing in the possibility of herd immunity. Check the other covid vaccine companies. Are they all down?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 10:59:57'] Buy the rumor sell the news. Ever since omicron started getting out of control I bought puts on PFE and it's been doing pretty well. The more positive news I see on PFE the more my puts go green.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 23:28:35'] Its mostly the fda approval the people are waiting for. They promised to hand in documents to the fda until end of year which they then did 31.12 so literal end of year. Thats why some investors are pissed because FDA approval will probably take until end of January.Thats all peanuts though and fundamentally the story is playing out quite nicely for novavax so IMO its a buy/holdDisclaimer: bullish on Novavax, holding shares (1000€ so not really impactful but disclaimer nonetheless)

How reasonable do you think that is for this company and future sales of vaccines? Before covid, it's market cap was $100 million.

Feels high maybe so just start with a nibble with intent to buy more, higher or lower.Diversify into some of the big s&p names and other index drivers, you're likely missing out on broader market returns. Even though your employer may be exposing you, a few shares of any of the top names may return a lot better without all the fat of the rest of the s&p average driving it down.I see fractional shares aren't possible, so depending on you some of those could be hard to buy. A single amzn and googl share is enough, especially amzn imo as they have been a laggard for nearly 2 years.

I’ve been following this company for 6 months and I am in it for the long haul. this drug is immune to mutations of COVID-19, simply because it does not target COVID-19. This “in the weeds” company is called Humanigen and their therapeutic drug is called Lenzilumab. Lenzilumab, with other treatments including steroids and/or remdesivir, help prevent and treat an immune hyper-response, (cytokine storm). GM-CSF is responsible for activating macrophages and monocytes that contribute to disease severity, Mapping Severe COVID-19 in the Lungs at Single-Cell Resolution – NIH Director's Blog .[mapping severe covid](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/04/13/mapping-severe-covid-19-in-the-lungs-at-single-cell-resolution/) Fully administered in one day, Lenzilumab improves patient SpO2 levels within the first 24 hours as shown by mayo clinic study and can prevent progression to invasive mandatory ventilation by 54%. It helps get patients out of the ICU/ hospital sooner, making more room for other critical patients in need. Humanigen Inc. - Humanigen Reports Positive Phase 3 Topline Results Demonstrating That Lenzilumab™ Improves Survival Without Need for Mechanical Ventilation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19[phase 3 results](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2021/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19/default.aspx) One item that may be a concern is the cost of the drug. However, the need for mechanical ventilation significantly increases the costs of COVID-19 care, as well as having a prolonged stay in the ICU. I’m not sure on Canada’s numbers in our healthcare, but in the States, it’s 5x the cost Mechanical Ventilation Adds 5X the Cost to COVID-19 Care | Premier (premierinc.com)[5x cost ](https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/blog/mechanical-ventilation-adds-5x-the-cost-to-covid-19-care) The FDA has revoked EUA for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab because of its ineffectiveness against newer strains while being used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms , FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab (govdelivery.com)[bam is bad](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/2cd68e3)Of the currently available vaccines with mutations on the rise and reduced efficacy against them, I believe that Lenzilumab can help save lives and solve multiple problems that we are currently facing. Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it’s getting silenced from HF shorts. So much amazing news. Again please do your own DD but I think this is a diamond in the rough.

It’s been reported that in Florida, one of the hardest hit states, DeSantis administration has fudged with the way the covid cases are reported in the last several weeks. You were seeing 20k+ new cases every day and 500+ deaths and then all of a sudden, it goes to less than 10k literally in one day, with a few days of 0 new cases and 0 deaths throw in. It doesn’t make any sense. I think this might be happening in other states as well. These numbers are being underreported.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.\n\nMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks.

I get being skeptical, but is there any semi recent/modern precedent of the Fed/some other govt institution doing a complete surprise 180 on a policy or plan that they’ve talked about ad nauseam for months, that would justify such a jittery/skiddish sentiment?

	COMMENT: ['2019-10-18 19:18:47'] Looking at the holdings, I like it a lot.In addition, it might be worth it to consider buying some PFE and JNJ in addition to PJP (PFE and JNJ are both in PJP). PFE is at a pretty good discount right now and JNJ will likely be at a discount on Monday due to the asbestos issue today. JNJ closed down 5 or 6% today. JNJ has a 3% dividend yield and PFE has a 4% dividend yield.BIIB is also trading at a large discount, although it doesn't have a dividend.

And apart from the COVID vaccines, they have a good pipeline in general. CMV vaccine in phase 3 studies. Vaccine has zero competition the market is worth $20B.

The more complicated one is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model which adds up all the company's future earnings based on various assumptions and compares to what the market prices the company at today based on the stock price.A simpler, more approachable model you could use for your assignment is the Dividend Growth model - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.aspYou could also compare various valuation metrics of PFE (the P/E ratio, Price/Sales, etc) against other companies in its industry and use that to make an argument that its over or undervalued.

POST_TEXT: b"Roth IRA, so long term profits are the goal.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:43:55'] First of all I wish I just had a Roth at 19 much less one that is thoughtfully put together. Personal I would consolidate my Fzrox and VTI as well as Fxaiz and VOO. There is also a argument that you don’t need a total market fund and a s&p500 fund. The returns on them are similar with a slight edge to the total market funds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 14:24:29'] The below is an almost first copy pasta from my last comment, edited slightly to assist for your particularsWrong allocation. Check the ETF holdings and you'll see they cross hold many of the same names already so why punt on them again individually? Try some Real Estate is another good asset allocation choice. Think of David Swensen and his key lessons:1/ asset allocation2/ security selection3/ market timingSo, you're young and want to be mostly in equities. Fine, but think of 1/ above, so pick some long dated inflation protected bond ETF (for example) and tuck 10% thereDiversification brings benefits, but it has to be meaningful, so if you want that real estate ETF make it 10% tooSo now you know you're going to be 80% equities. But always? Perhaps some years (some big life events make you more conservative) you will lower that target allocation by X% and allocate it to other assets you discover: private equity, high yield credits, etc. Or to your bond and/or real estate allocation on a permanent basis. The market timing of the advice from Swensen will be taken care of by saying to yourself at each annual rebalance, when you reduce equities to the new target (80 - X next year), "are equities over valued" and if the easy answer is yes you simply rebalance so the target is missed by 5% and you put half of the dollar value in bonds and half in real estate over and above what you had to do to bring them to 10% eachNow for security selecting... the 2/ above. There are so many interesting ETFs that deal with the problems the S&P 500 has which are almost as cheap as Vanguard's flagships. You can find one that looks at value with momentum overlay in emerging markets. There are ones that go long/ short. Basically you can easily target some key factors: small size, high growth, high quality, high value. You pick funds that give you access to that globally, you'll be doing okay. Look at ETF screening websites for ideas.And you want to punt on names? Take half your dividend each year and have a punt. Break it up into 12 parts and pick a name (pick a guru to follow, but a system to trade with, do your own DCF on some screener output) or an option or an altcoin or a future on a commodity or a currency each month and have a dabble. And if you have fun and do well perhaps parlay those profits into something more in that field. And if you lose, think of it as play money. The rest of the dividends, plug back in to the portfolio at the next rebalanceDM me if you need more of a walk through
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:45:59'] According to the information on Fidelity Roth IRA for minors web page, you will have approximately $3 millions by the age of 70 (assuming you contribute 6k/year until 50 years old and then add 1k more + average market growth of your investments). It will all be tax free (except when extreme leftists come into power and take away all your money).You could have more than that if you can grow your money faster. You can have a fancy car now, or a decent used car and more contributions to the Roth IRA.Good start. I am hoping my son will be able to see your wisdom.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 12:56:25'] Okay, I sold VTI, VOO, and FZROX.  Still deciding on FNILX vs FXAIX vs FSKAX.Keeping FZILX because I like having some international exposure.FDKLX is nice because it'll automatically change stuff for me as I get older, but not really sure how much that matters at 19 with almost 40 years left for the investments to grow... Might sell that one and do the whole partial bond allocation thing myself when I'm a lot older.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:53:05'] Well you're doing it all wrong IN MY OPINON (not financial advice fyck you SEC)1) Lease a car or buy under $4k (probably $5k now after inflation). Buying a car is the biggest waste of money you'll ever make. Always add debt before using capital. That's the best motto in life. Doesn't mean go consume all your income on credit card interest. But leverage the shjt out of your income. It's harder to save than it is to make payments.2) Putting money into any kind of investment account is a waste. Only do it if you're set on never investing. Investing implies active management whether you're trading or investing in the literal sense. If you're no good at it, sure, create an IRA and throw money into that black hole and forget about it.3) Too many funds, not enough concentration. Pick 3 stocks/ETFs you like and focus on those. Probably something like: FNILX, TSLA, swap AAPL for a bank (JPM, BAC, GS) and then consolidate all the rest into those.That would put you on a much stronger footing than where you're currently at.You then manage those 3 positions as you branch into opportunities, treating those 3 positions as a kind of keel or ballast to your ship at sea.

POST_TEXT: b'I would like some suggestions for me to do some analysis. This year have been dreadful for me and my portfolio. I have always invested in hyper growth/growth companies with a good business. It always worked until it did not. I have only been in the market 4-5 years and I am never experienced current macro environment. I ended up buying dips on my holding which dipped another 30-40 percent and it devastated my portfolio. I started the year around 225k now I am down to 60k. I am still holding some companies I truly believe in but realized losses to free some cash.\n\nNow I am looking to pick some stocks that suits current macro environment and can offer some upsides. I am starting to look at some low valuation companies. So far I like some bio tech companies i.e. MRK PFE CCXI & other stocks like VALE VIAC. What will be your suggestion? Thank you'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 06:27:42'] Based on your post I think you need a lot more consideration then hopping on the next hot thing. Losing 75% of the value of your investment means either you need to just hold strong through a dip in growth stocks (assuming your picks are strong and this is the nature of high growth), or you need a new strategy. I would take a serious look at your current portfolio before just sinking more in. With that said I think if you like growth and have a high risk tolerance this is actually a great year to get into clean energy
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 06:40:15'] Just the list you posted there says a lot about your current holdings. In short, you’re trying too hard. I would die to have 225k disposable money. Anyway, to your question: when inflation goes up, some business are able to forward the cost and the consumer purchases regardless as it is a necessity. When people have to scale back spending, they can scale back on everything except food, inexpensive clothing and housing/roof over their head. So companies that make necessities will weather the storm. PG JNJ are good ones. Banks also tend to do well because of short term lending. Some health care also does well, but more like UNH than biotech. Search for inflation resistance stocks and you’ll get a few good lists. Aim to create a dividend portfolio first. You have a lot of money it seems like and loosing it, shouldn’t be your goal. Most companies that are goods based also give decent dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 07:37:05'] What macro env are you talking about. It depends on your assessment of the situation.I am assuming this pandemic situation will take 5 years to sort out. We are in year 3. Geopolitical landscape is volatile, so they say. Stock pull back is coming on, so they say, as bonds put pressure on stocks. Being in the market the last 5 years means you are experiencing a rare event or not as rare as they used to be. Inflation talk, supply chain, work force issues. There’s value there if you can parse it all. Any whoPersonally I would stick with stocks in the 5-10 years timeframe. Since my vision of the current situation is cloudy at best. Stick with company that produce products that sell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-08 07:43:22'] If you know economics then you know what's going on. Supply shifted left due to shortage, demand shifted right due to fiscal and they both moved up due to QE.The fed signals that it will shift them both down. Everyone is expecting demands to shift down while supply will slowly move if at all. This of course will reduce price as well as sales.This means staple, boring goods will probably make a decent profit because their demand curve is price insensitive. Of course, everyone knows this so they probably already in and you will be playing catch up paying a premium for the stock.

The big pharmaceutical company and partner BioNTech became the first to launch a vaccine. And that product now has fully vaccinated 49 million Americans. That's more than rivals Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer recently forecast $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine revenue this year.\n\n>But Pfizer isn't stopping there. The company is now ready to conquer another massive coronavirus market. That move could give it ownership of the entire coronavirus space...and this dominance could be right around the corner."
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 12:52:48'] I have BioNTech shares - for them this is a much bigger deal given their small size. Remember, they were the ones who developed the vaccine and hold the patent. Pfizer is the (very powerful) production and distribution partner.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 12:54:30'] I mean of course the CEO has every incentive to state that. It’s almost like his compensation is tied to the amount of hopium in the stock
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 12:09:10'] If this information was good for other companies then it would be great. However PFE is garbo for any type of news unless it’s HUGE. Good news? Bad news? Flat.

I'm sure the corona extension will help but I wouldn't necessarily count on it to make the company the number one player in any space. I have Pfizer in my own portfolio through an ETF and the stock itself. It's a great investment IMO, mit oder ohne corona
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 14:37:59'] They can't ever have total market dominance because its an absolute nightmare to ship the Pfizer vaccine compared to the others.You need it be at extreme extreme cold temperatures that struggle to survive global shipping.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-26 07:50:10'] I think that the recovery story is grossly optimistic. The unemployment numbers are at record highs and social distancing practices are going to continue throughout much of the remaining months in 2020. Many of the policy makers are trying to refrain from using the word “stimulus” because that’s not at all what it is. These are safety nets for a collapsing economy.Id love to hear everyone’s opinion on this because the stock market is not at all reflecting this. I just cant see how the economy can magically place those 26 million unemployed back into jobs when the demand wont be there for their products and services.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-25 16:07:26'] My trading strategy is a bit of an educated guess. I swing trade, but I’m looking at charts daily. I don’t enter a position unless the risk is minimal. Therefor, if I’m wrong, I’ll take a paper cut loss instead of losing big like some newer people do. Most of the time, you’re gonna be wrong. That’s the nature of the market. The point is to capitalize on the correct ones and limit the losses on the incorrect ones. So however you’d like to incorporate that strategy, is up to you. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 16:17:19'] All in on V. V launched a "tap to phone" service few weeks back. This should help push the digital commerce even more because setting/maintaining POS terminals is not cheap. It will hit SQ market share though
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 17:33:25'] Visa seems super popular around here, but Mastercard seems to have higher growth in the last decade. Why does everyone seem to favor V over MA?

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 20:32:41'] Hey man. I live in the nordics. The visa model might not be as safe and future proof as you think. Here we have a service called vipps. Basically u pay using ur telephone number which is used as an authenticator for ur bank account ( roughly explained). Its called bank ID on mobile. This is the real future of payments and i see it taking off in 1-2 years in the rest of europe
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 17:53:05'] Square and PayPal are moving into digital currency like how you pay in China. Basically scan a QR code anywhere and it deducts from your account. Carry no cards and pay with your phone.Was absurd visiting relatives when the ally fruit vendor in a small wooden cart had his QR code on a nice little plack mounted on the side. And people just paid for fruit that way and it went in his account.China already heavily investing into a digital Yuan and the US is following suit. Traditional credit cards still have time left but they'll slowly be replaced. It's about time credit cards get replaced.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 17:20:32'] Personally I favor V over PYPL, SQ, but I’m not sure why everyone argues about which is better. Shut up and buy all 3, that’s what I did with just a higher allocation to visa.

	COMMENT: ['2016-04-06 09:57:00'] Look at the rally across healthcare as the thought turns to who else may be of interest now that Pfizer/Allergan is off - Allergan or Pfizer go after someone else, or someone else goes after Allergan, etc.

POST_TEXT: b"Background: New to investing. Did some research on Pfizer some weeks ago and believed they were leading on COVID vaccine development. Not wrong in the end.\n\nI was expecting the price to go up quite significantly because of it (perhaps like 15%)? But since news on this Pfizer vaccine announced, the price has been steady at $34-$36, and no visible benefit derived from this breakthrough.\n\nMy other stocks have gone up but I couldn't seem to find any obvious rationale as to their increase (other than the market is generally going up).\n\nCan anyone kindly explain to me why Pfizer isn't going up? Thanks.\n\nI'm holding 40 shares atm.\n\nEdit: share position."
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:05:56'] The vaccines, from any and all companies, are not being priced for profit. Regardless, PFE is a good long-term hold with a strong dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:06:58'] Pfizer is huge company. Takes a lot more to move the needle.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:47:10'] Pfizer is a massive company, where it would need a pretty insane amount of buys for it to affect stocks.It shot up on announcement of vaccine by like 5-8% from what I remember, which is pretty significant considering how big the company is
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:08:09'] PFE did spike about 9% on the day of news. Then Amazon announced their online pharmacy and PFE took a hit.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:09:58'] I think they’s a hearing for emergency approval of the vaccine in mid December (Dec. 15th?), which is before moderna’s. I would be shocked if the FDA didn’t approve it. If they do, I’d expect a bounce then at least in the short term, however idk about long term prospects— the vaccine will help drug companies gain notoriety but probably not contribute much to profits.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 00:06:29'] a big pharma company means more than this. they make the vaccines so we can resume life and consume their products.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 02:36:44'] I also hold Pfizer stock. Part of the reason might be Pfizer spun off part of its business into a different company with a different ticker for regulatory reasons it seems.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-01 16:17:50'] It hit $40 today. Well.I sold at 36. Well.Money. Well.

While turning down an offer months ago from Pfizer due to fulfillment concerns. So maybe people think Pfizer growth in the COVID vaccine sector isn't looking bright.The crazier part is that Moderna is down too. After essentially doubling their revenue.

Novavax is good but tirals finish in January where Moderna is seeking FDA emergency approval this week (or next)Ibr been doing this day trading shit for a year. Im up alot but taxes, commissions and the time-consuming almost extra occupation of just reading has left me tired of it.The worse thing is how disconnected stocks are from the physical market. Its all hype paid for by some investment bankers with insider info. Selling us lies to buy or sell whatever they want. God forbid you do your own research during off hours just to see the stock you picked as a future onvestment just gain in the aftermarket until the buy in is peaked and heading down.Idk. This shit is fun but you really need to invest time and accept hard truths which I am struggling to accept.

You gotta get in beforehand, watch that shit run up and when the good news hits, start selling for profit. Run for the exits with fists full of moneybags while the suckers are just starting to pay attention. Remember, be first, be smarter or cheat. For retail traders, being first is the only option.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 22:21:29'] a company like pfizer has been around for years, so developing a vaccine won't raise their stock price more than what it's already valued at. as opposed to moderna, a relatively new company in the biotech/pharma world, their stock rises because it's their "first" product. another thing to consider is that pfizer won't really profit from the vaccine because they're trying to make it widely available at a cost (or none, haven't really looked into that aspect yet) that's more of a "good deed" for everyone

It seems like every week there is something people are waiting on that may spook the market. Not sure if this was common pre-pandemic? Any insight?

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 01:00:34'] Hi fellow eurobro, Italian living in Norway here!From what I read, you've little confidence in many of your picks, which is not a good sign. Do you know what Crayon does? Do you know 70% of their business is from a single client? (Microsoft, which is good, but still a single client). To know everything about a company you own will increase conviction and will be easy to stick with it in downturns. If you're a beginner, I would advise you to invest first in ETF such as VOO, VTI, QQQ or even SMH if you know the Semiconductors market. There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.Always keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.And remember that 99% of traders don't beat the market. Index investing and dollar cost averaging is boring but it works, especially because it removes the worst enemies of an investor: fear, greed and emotions in general.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 00:58:19'] I would get out of SBS, although it is technically a water company as you say, it is a government owned sewage/water company and the politics in Brazil, specially São Paulo are not that good.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 01:10:43'] If you only got in about a month ago, really don't worry about the "loss". Ups and downs are going to happen long term - you just came in right about when things started correcting.Look to put some ETFs in for some core stability. An S&P tracker like VOO, some geo-diversification and some industry specific.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 01:26:36'] \-Is your portfolio messed up?  No it's better than 90% of the portfolios you see here, at least you thought a little about why you bought what and didn't just go 100% US-Tech. That said I wouldn't recommend buying something just because "people are talking about it" that isn't a good strategy. If yo ain't 100% confident in your stock picks, you might also want to include some index funds. You could do something like 20% Total US market, 20 developed markets, ex US, 20% emerging market and 40% individual stocks. you can also do a 30/30/30/10 split and just follow two stocks closely, to really learn what it's like to invest in individual stocks.\-Is it okay to discuss EU stocks  Yes. We have a lot of people from the US here, and US stocks have done great in the past, so naturally, you get a lot of people thinking that US stocks are the only stocks that make sense to invest in, which is false. People also somehow got the idea that "they know US stocks better" something I can't exclude, but I highly doubt they know them better than any other stocks, at least to any meaningful extent. That said accounting regulation differs between countries, and you need to be aware of this if you invest in individual stocks around the world.\-Are prices too high?  Too high? I don' know, but prices are very high, which has a negative impact on future returns.  To quote every financial article ever written. "If things go well stocks might go up, but if things go poorly they might also go down"  In any case, it's better to be invested than not. If you are very worried and are sitting on a lump sum, you can divide that sum by 12, and invest it over 12 months.\-How did I get started.  Youtube inspired me at first.  I would start by watching the lectures Aswath Damodaran got on his channel. That should get you started with the basics. When you're done with that I can provide you with a reading list if you are interested.\-Have you ever doubted your trades  Yes I think that's true for everyone. Back in September when the market was setting all-time highs I was down 16% for the year. I was not happy. Today I am up 24% vs the markets 22% since 01/012020. every single person that invests in individual stocks will have periods of underperformance, in some cases, they will underperform massively.  For me two things really help. The first is just knowing what you are doing. If you know the companies you are buying are solid, you know it's stupid to sell when they are down. In fact doing anything other than buying more would be stupid. After all, if the price is down 16%, but the fundamentals are the same, my return must be 16% higher now..  Another trick I use is to only look at my portfolio when I buy and sell stocks. Not much is going to change in a company in a month, and the only time you get enough information to truly act is with the quarterly report, so unless you find a new company you want to invest in, you can't make a lot of meaningful changes outside of earnings season anyway, so just don't bother looking, or in the case of most people. Just fight the urge to look. It gets easier with time.\-Any suggestions  I already suggested the 20/20/20/40 or the 30/30/30/10 split between indexes and individual stocks, and I stand by that.  Next time ask one question at a time. I'm not even going to proofread this that's how long it is, so I'm sorry about all the errors.

Plenty of room to grow.ARKK - Had a bad stretch of couple weeks, nice entry point as of now.BRK.B - I don't have this stock, looking back I wish I bought it back then.. Been super steady. Great way to diversify your portfolio.Edit: down 5% is not bad! I was around 10-15% couple weeks ago, and then my DIS,AAPL,AMD, Tesla and Weed stocks recovered. whew.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 13:08:16'] Not going to respond to the whole thing but I’ll give you one advice regarding Apple. If you’re buying today because you think they will remain a dominant player in the phone market, how much do you think is the market going to grow to justify any further share price increase?Hint: not much. Most people in the world already own a phone or two and they simply won’t start buying more phones. The adoption S curve is flattening.What Apple needs to do to grow further is find other sources of revenue. If you look at their product line (or earnings), you’ll see a huge portion of their income is from other products (accessories, Apple Watch, etc.) and digital (App Store, subscriptions). In fact, Apple Store is where a lot of the revenue increase has been coming from for years. They’re already diversifying and been doing so for a long time.In conclusion, I don’t have anything against Apple, but be careful about why you pick stocks and how you justify their growth potential.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 10:41:35'] Here’s an idea. Come up with a list of sectors that make sense to you. Let’s say (for me) it might be tech, healthcare, banking, real estate and retailers. Think about things that are diverse and yet you interact with them in some way. We all go to Walmart & target, right? There are “official” sectors out there - you could choose from those. Making up your own might be more fun thoughNow, split your money between those sectors. Doesn’t have to be equal - you can be “overweight” in a sector if you want. That’s the essence of rotation - if you feel tech has ended it’s tear, and it’s time for retail to take off, put more in retail than tech Now, in each of your sectors choose two companies. I like number 1 and an aggressive challenger, but you could look for an undervalued player, a fast follower, clear leader, etc. that gives you that fun of picking winners - at the same time as reducing the risk be peanut-buttering your moneyUpside? Diversification should make you a lot less susceptible to sudden moves within a sectorDownside? If you screw up the weighting, growth j  one sector will be offset by a loss in anotherThis isn’t “set and forget”, though. If you do have the sector winner as one of your picks, that won’t change that often, but sometimes second place or undervalued player can change over timeFull disclosure - I had a system like this at one point, but got bored with the upkeep and also felt I wasn’t really beating some of the broader funds so I switched to “set and forget” with a few fidelity funds - mainly focused on small / mid caps

You basically have a 1 in like 5 or 6 chance of guessing the right company. The other 4 or 5 companies will likely fall sharply once one of the vaccines is approved. I own pfizer but I don't think I'd buy more now. If you could have bought them 2+ weeks ago, I would have. JNJ is the only other one I own and would recommend only because it's vaccine business is only an iota of their business, so decent upside for a successful vaccine, but a small downside for someone else beating them.

I ain't touching that because my balls isn't big enough to deal with that riskiness when I can do PFE and just earn dividends. AZN is pretty nice but I think overvalued.

I'm looking medium to long term, and I can wear through storms like this one or the COVID crash back in March 2020 as I don't need this cash any time soon.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:39:49'] Why not both?  I own both.Edit:  I see you already have AAPL. If that’s the case and you are happy with your allocation, DIS it is.Still has a tech component of it with Disney+ but it has business lines AAPL does not have.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:47:46'] Apple. I’m going to go with the Best company in the world. They are #1 sales in: Phone, Tablet, watches, Headphone, App Store, Accessory for products, and with their dedicated computer chips are now the best selling laptops for the price. They’re getting into EV and it will further explode. Apple is always the answer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:39:15'] You'll be averaging up on AAPL? I like the idea of going non-tech since you're tech heavy but I feel DIS is expensive at the moment... although I do love the mouse and watch it every week with my daughter

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:42:38'] ACTC at 28... :(I'd go for the AAPL at market open. You should be pretty close to 100 shares if not over it, which means you can sell covered calls for some extra income.DIS isn't a bad long term hold though and you may consider adding some later.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 22:04:52'] I mean. AAPL is at a $2.03 trillion market cap. If it were to double that would make it at $4.06 trillion. DIS is at $353 billion market cap. If it went up 300% it would be at a $1 trillion market cap. Imo, the question comes down to how high will Apple’s market cap go? People thought $1 trillion was impossible, then Apple did it, then $2 trillion was impossible, here we are. Will it soon hit $4 trillion?IMO both are expensive rn. Especially Disney. And this ain’t advice obvio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:32:26'] I have owned Apple for a long time and am always happy to buy more. I owned Disney for over 10 years and had kept reinvesting until this winter. I know it’s at a great price right now, but I cashed out. I don’t see why Disney is valued where it is, and I don’t think now is a good time to buy into it. That’s my personal opinion, but since you asked, I’ve shared. If you want to stick with some pretty solid performance, get more Apple. If you’re looking for something in entertainment, look at SIX. It was at more than $60 before the COVID shutdowns and is dancing around the mid $40’s right now. I think there is room to grow there.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:29:54'] I like both and own both. I have more Apple than Disney because it’s just been a strong horse for me over the years and the dividends is a nice bonus in recent years. I think Apple still has a solid growth story and it’ll continue to expand its subscription model. They might expand their product and services. Not sure what. You have Apple so I would add more to Disney to balance it out. I don’t think Disney will go back to dividends but those were nice and the only reason I held on to Disney at $85/share for so many years. It had done literally nothing until it added Disney plus. That recurring revenue stream is going to be a key business driver. I think the movie distribution industry is going to change a lot post COVID and Disney is poised to win here with their platform. Aside from movies, they have amazing content that they could spin off from just the marvel universe alone (eg Wanda Vision, etc). Parks will reopen eventually. P/E on these companies are high but who knows what investors are looking for anymore. Long term, I don’t think you can go wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 07:38:55'] Buy more of both
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 08:17:39'] I've owned both for awhile. Right now I plan on holding for another 20-30 years
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:07:44'] Honestly neither, they’re both very overvalued from a historical perspective. If you absolutely had to pick one I would go with Apple. Cue someone to tell me why this time is different and something magical happened to Apple’s business in 2018 which made a mid-teens PE diverge to a mid-thirties. Similar with Disney.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 22:22:45'] You should’ve gotten Apple at 116 on Monday! There’s still time she could still head back this week before skyrocketing again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 09:04:08'] personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the "apple car", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't "make" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 04:17:15'] I bought both
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 04:59:25'] Dis has exposure to several sectors all in one. Cruise line, resorts, theme parks, streaming, e-commerce, brick and mortar. It's bounced back from last year and has hit ATH all while running at partial capacity and shutting off dividends. Not saying it's a moon shot, but if you're already into AAPL, might as well pick up some DIS
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 18:02:33'] Little worried what happens to Apple stock at least in the short term if the Apple car goes the way of The Apple television that never materialized.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 19:18:22'] I wouldn’t look for the company that’s going to provide treatment for this terrible disease but instead invest in profitable companies that will generate returns for you so that you can afford to donate to research groups and organizations helping those with Alzheimer’s. That said, sorry to hear about your mother, I’ve heard it’s awful.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 17:16:57'] Don’t invest in any pharmaceuticals that are doing this yet.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 21:45:33'] I know someone, recently retired, who was doing basic research on Alzheimer's and his claim/complaint was/is that the research is EXTREMELY inbred. Basically (if I am remember the claim correctly--I'm not an expert myself, but have heard the beef more than a few times) all the leading "experts" were stuck on the theory that the symptoms were caused by the plaque from garbage proteins accumulating in the brain. He said that there really wasn't good evidence that this was actual the root cause, but rather a secondary effect of the root cause (sorry I don't remember exactly what he posited the cause to be) that caused both the plaque build up AND the dementia. However, all the leading Alzheimer scientists were/are absolutely invested in the plaque theory, would basically trash any research proposals that did not follow that dogma (that the experts held, who were also the most influential reviewers despite a conflict of interest)--basically if you had alternative theories it was extremely difficult to get funding, either from federal agencies (because the experts thought you were an idiot if you didn't tow their line) or from drug companies that wanted to follow a "safe" strategy even though none of the therapies based on this safe strategy had much effect on the disease (even if they reduced plaque).So, tl;dr would not recommend investing in companies involved in Alzheimer's drug development, because they are stuck on "safe" paths even those these safe paths have been shown repeatedly to be fruitless.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 19:53:11'] Not my personal experience but some of my family members have had similar stories to yours. If you care deeply about the subject matter rather than wasting money investing in a long shot stock I think we would all be better served if you invested it more wisely in growth stocks that are making money today and then use some of your profits to donate to the research and development of any organization you deem worthy of your money.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 08:15:50'] Hey friend I’m sorry what you are going thru.  I wanna tell you something I’ve learned since graduating with a degree in molecular neurobiology.  Alz is an EXTREMELY tough cookie to crack.  We can’t even figure out what causes it, let alone treatments and cures for it.  There are theories like alpha/beta proteins, prions, etc. The tough part for big pharma companies is that they invest millions of dollars into promising compounds, only for them to fail in testing.  Companies are getting burned by it so they don’t wanna particularly spend money only to fail.  Now maybe a company like pfe or someone might get it, knock it outta the park.  I hope they do. That will be amazing.  The scientist and philanthropist side of me wants to pile money into companies so they can do this, but the realistic scientist and investor side of me sees it is a gamble.  I believe that you should invest your money in companies that match your values, so if you wanna see alz go away, do it.  It will be a long run position is all I want to say. Just my perspective.  I only have a ba in neurobiology and a few years of pharma experience, so take what you will.  I hope you and your family the best.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 21:02:18'] Billions (not exaggerating) have been spent in the last few decades without much incremental progress in an ALZ therapeutic. There's still a lot of science that needs to be discovered. Several big pharma companies have given up in this space - Biogen is still in the ring but it has suffered both setbacks and some hopeful progress in the past few years. I would personally not invest in anything I do not fully understand.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 02:12:16'] Alzheimer's treatments are particularly difficult to predict. I'm sure we will be able to cure it somewhere this century, but it really is the medical equivalent to a lottery in terms of which cure will be the one to do it.If I were to make a guess right now, I'd say by far the biggest chance to solve this are CRISPR and Neuralink, and they're probably much better investments regardless, because they both have much broader applications than specifically solving Alzheimer's. You can't invest in Neuralink yet, but $CRSP or a CRISPR ETF seem like good bets.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-04 15:49:29'] While it is a really really interesting area, every clinical trial so far has essentially failed. Biogen's is like... Ehh I guess it may help delay progression in a small population for a bit. Until better basic research is published I wouldnt invest in a biotech that only working on alzheimer's as it would be super high risk

You can go to "Look Inside" on Amazon to read some of it. Basically they found research done that point to high insulin as the main cause of major diseases including heart disease, Alzheimer, etc. It's published in July 2020. So, hope you find it helpful. This book strongly suggests that you can lower your risk of diseases by changing your diet and lifestyle. That's a much better option than taking drugs.

Someday one of them will hopefully find something viable, but until then, they remain kind of the "long shot" of the experimental bio playing field.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 05:55:14'] My wife has Frontal Temporal Dementia which is a variant of Alzheimer's.  In fact, she has gotten to the point that we will be putting her in an Alzheimer's unit in a nursing home as soon as I can get all of the arrangements made. (probably later this month or early next month).Her neurologist is most optimistic about one currently undergoing FDA studies from Biogen (**BIIB**).  I believe this is the drug he's looking at:[https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/08/08/biogen-alzheimers-treatment-fda-review](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/08/08/biogen-alzheimers-treatment-fda-review)I see that a couple of people have already mentioned this company, but I'll just add my voice to those.  I don't personally know anything about the treatments (even though I work full time in the health care field, that's not my area of study); but if the neurologist who spends most of his time treating this disease thinks this one shows promise, then I'd say this one is the one to look at.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 06:27:12'] The sad truth about AD is that no real breakthroughs have been made in decades. Like others have mentioned, research was fixated on the amyloid thesis (protein plaques in the brain). This was the main hypothesis for last 20+ years and all they have to show for it is Biogen's NDA that has 2 Phase 3 trials which show inconclusive results. Even if Biogen's drug aducanumab is approved, it won't materially change much for patients. At best, it will be used more in future combination therapies with other approaches. This is the biggest benefit I can take from potential FDA approval of aducanumab. The industry also started looking at another protein called tau, which was found in AD brains. The first big Phase 2 (Roche/AC Immune) also flopped. No statistically significant improvement in cognitive/behavioral measures. New methods are needed and DNLI seems promising. But I would hold back on investing. All AD early stage trials seem promising when looking at biomarkers. The big roadblock is being able to show improvement in larger sample of patients. This generally happens in Phase2b. So I would play early stage AD catalysts (biomarker data, small sample sizes, etc), but would stay away from mid-stage trials looking for improvement in patients. Historically, they have had a VERY LOW success rate.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-05 17:58:39'] Its definitely not bad in any way as Nvidia takes up a small portion of that ETF. So if you believe in Nvidia then you may as well own it twice, you will make much more out of its individual success rather then its success in an ETF. A lot of funds will hold hundreds of stocks so if you are trying to invest in individual stocks while also holding ETF's there is a big chance of owning something "twice".
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-05 18:29:06'] No issues, I have multiple overlapping stocks.  It increases your exposure to that specific stock.  If it does well, so do you.  If it underperforms, so do you.  If you are comfortable with that trade off, go for it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-05 18:10:23'] I have ETFs and some  individual stocks of  that particular ETF. I see it as leverage like if I needed to sell off some shares for whatever reason I rather keep the ETF and just unload the individual stock (if that makes sense)
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-05 20:34:28'] There’s nothing wrong with that, so long as you feel like the weighting is appropriate.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-06 03:48:43'] It doesn’t really matter, as long as you are aware of this fact and your position relative to your risk appetite is within your limits. I own AMD at least twice, but I don’t mind.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 00:15:54'] Depends on your age. If you're under 40 I would think you should liquidate and contribute to the roth IRA. Not only will dividends be protected, but so will capital gains when you finally withdraw. Which will likely be the vast majority of the account. However, a lot can change in a year, especially for business owners. If I were you, I would wait until April of 2022 (deadline for 2021 contributions) to liquidate. In the meantime, I would see if you could save up enough to contribute and not sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 04:55:12'] Your Roth IRA contribution won't be a tax deduction, however depending on your income you won't have tax on your long term capital gains (less than $40k income). Check with your tax guy.I think it's an awesome idea. Get it inside your Roth!

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:51:46'] Mainly that Pfizer is a massive company and this vaccine isn’t really a major source of consistent revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:31:53'] A textbook example of “buy the rumor, sell the news” that usually drives the market. It wasn’t just Pfizer today, it was all of the Dow and SP500 to some extent.Although, the supply chain issues that they expect to cut their delivery in half this month doesn’t help them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:48:04'] pfizer is such a huge pharmaceutical company that the vaccine is just a drop in their bucket. I personally did not buy into PFE for this reason. and also the vaccine is questionable IMO.. but that's for a different sub
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:32:01'] My 2¢ is that there are several other vaccines coming, Pfizer will have a lot of competition, they can’t deliver enough to dominate the market in 2022. Lastly the Covid vaccine will be a relatively small part of their business overall.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:53:19'] PFE is a long term guarantee. Everything right now V is just short squeezes or balances with the whole dow. Don’t stress pfe if you’re holding long term, I’m not.

Id say I have around 22 stocks.\n- Income: very fortunate to be in the $250-$300K range\n\nUp until now, Ive been fairly safe with my investments and havent made any big bets on any singular stocks, largest position would be about $7-8K (not including ETFs). My returns have been modest, 60% in the past 2.5-3 years. However, when I look at my top performing stocks, which were the ones I had the most confidence in buying, I didnt make a big purchase and some are +100% all the way up to +700%.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 08:36:20'] I’m 35, similar position as you and I put a sizable percentage of my portfolio in TDOC a few weeks ago.  Probably my highest conviction trade in a long while.Yes.  Putting a lot of money on one stock is gambling.  For sure.  But it’s not like going to the roulette table and throwing it all down on 14.  A lot of these companies out here are doing great, even during a pandemic.  And you can bet with a fairly high probability will be worth more this time next year.You’re young with a great income and a decent savings.  Just choose wisely.  People were name-calling those who invested in TSLA at $400 in March.  That aged well...
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 08:16:20'] This is classic gambling mindset. Slot machine trickles in some modest wins to hook you and get you to bet it big and lose it all. With that said, do it. You have a portfolio over 250k, if you believe in a company you can put 100k which is less than half of it in that company while keeping the rest diversified. There are more risky things to do.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 09:24:46'] I did this with $TESLA a while back, I took out a 20k loan + 27k(my own money) and a 10k margin just to buy more... it was the stupidest thing that I’ve ever done but it definitely paid off.

Your long accounts is suppose to keep assets that have been identified as good holds for 5-10 years.Your short account, you can day trade, meme trade, momentum trade.  Whatever it takes so you don't feel like you're missing out.  Actually managing this feeling of "missing out" is probably one of the key things to learn as a good trader.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 10:08:49'] Definitely do it but you can also take a conservative approach to this method. Slowly build the 100k position over a couple weeks rather than throwing it all in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 10:25:38'] Inesting 100k doesn't necessarily have to be risky or a gamble, but you should absolutely be familiar with the company that you are investing in and you should do a good amount of research on it. Check the Income statements, Balance sheets and Cash flow statements of the last lets say 10 years, make sure everything is growing at a good rate. The company you would be investing in should have a good competitive advantage to make sure the business will be around in the future.  Pay close attention to the management and please don't buy some kind of overvalued hype stock because you want to buy low and sell high not buy high and then lose your investment. I would recommend you to buy below intrinsic value, that would decrease the chance of losing your money but that's just the way I see it. You can take some risks because you are still young and losing this money won't greatly affect your life because of this you can maybe look into mid cap stocks. Just make sure you do your research, also be patient and don't let emotions take over because it's a larger amount of money than usual.

If you are looking for some thrills with high risk, high reward, AND high maintenance - options. I know it’s a WSB meme, but you can make a buck doing that and it’s not much crazier than throwing half your portfolio into a single asset. You can scale $10k pretty well if you are decent at option trading (re: not greedy).

Even if your whole portfolio of $250K went down to $0, you won't go starving and you have plenty of time to recover. One thing to keep in mind though.....if you are looking for more aggressive growth beyond 60% over 3 years, you are somewhat entering the mindset of gambling.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if most of those gains came this year, which has been an abnormal year.I look back at my 25 years of investment history and 2 investments stick out in my mind, which allowed me to be in a position for early retirement:* Purchasing 80K shares of Nortel when it was $0.52* Re-allocating my proceeds from Nortel and went all in on Apple in 2010Both purchases were +10x'ers.  I definitely had/have a more aggressive investing mindset.  It's not for everyone.  My mindset at the time was I should be able to retire somewhere between 47 and 87.  :)If you want to win big, then you have to take bigger risks.  Just be aware of the risks and the losses that could accompany those risks.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 14:38:28'] Moderna is leading the STOCK PRICE race, but you're forgetting some of the critical success factors for "winning" the vaccine race.  1. Even if you have successful vaccine trials, you still need to be able to MASS produce the vaccine, which Moderna's small (by comparison) size cannot do.  Therefore, they'd have to either contract out or sell out to be profitable.   1. 1 Point for PFE, JNJ, AZN    0 Points for MRNA2. Moderna has virtually no vertical integration, meaning they will pay out the ass for raw materials and APIs, plus this will lengthen their lead times as they will have to rely on outside vendors to make their product, and the other big boys won't.  They'll crush Moderna in regards to speed and cost.    1. 2 Points for PFE & JNJ     0 Pints for MRNA3. If by some wild chance Moderna "wins" then they are likely lacking a VERY key part of mass producing the vaccine: Glass.  Big pharma probably bought up virtually all of the world's glass from Schott/Gerrsheimer in anticipation for producing billions of vials.  Moderna was late to the party, so they're either screwed on glass or they'll have to try and buy from one of the bigger (wiser) pharma companies...again killing their margins.   1. 3 Points PFE, JNJ, AZN  Still 0 Points for MRNA4. In case you haven't noticed, Moderna's shady CEO has sold a CRAP LOAD of MRNA stock recently...which doesn't bode well for investors.  Meanwhile, insiders at companies such as PFE have been BUYING stock.   1. 4 Points PFE (not sure about JNJ or AZN here) and still 0 Points for MRNA5. The most important aspect of a successful Pump & Dump Scheme is the pump, and to be the most successful at this you'd need to be in bed with Trump and his cronies.  In this category Modera is CRUSHING the competition.  Their CEO has spent more time pumping the vaccine than working on it, so kudos to the shareholders so far because nobody pumps like MRNA pumps.    1. 4 Points PFE, 3 Points JNJ & AZN and 1 Point for MRNAIn conclusion, MRNA is not leading the race, they are leading the pump.  The winner will be able to mass produce with the best margins.  If you got into MRNA early then good for you, the stock is booming.  But if you're on the fence, I wouldn't chase the stock from here; I'd focus on the beaten down big pharma stocks that are likely to be the long term winners of this race, like PFE, JNJ, or AZN.    Moderna is a GREAT swing trade stock, but I wouldn't count on them winning in the long run, so it depends what kind of investor you are.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 14:17:20'] I already sold my shares but I do like them as an investment.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 17:07:23'] Be careful with these. Moderna has soared before in recent weeks and months, all based on hype, just like novavax and vaxart and whoever else gets mentioned in a headline somewhere. Market goes crazy about it but it's a lot of hype and FOMO.if you're gonna get on then make sure you get off again quick before you're caught with your pants down
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 14:48:10'] They aren't necessarily in the lead. They have gotten the most press but BNTX/Pfizer is on almost exactly the same timeline and has 4 candidates (i.e. better odds for success and/or more effective success than Moderna). Pay attention to the dates they announce as the start and then full enrollment of PH 3 studies. Pfizer has deeper pockets and more experience with FDA submissions so even if they are a little behind they may be able to catch up. I also believe that Astra Zeneca is in roughly the same timeline but I'm not sure how close they are.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 14:32:32'] I shifted my % I had going into multiple pharmaceutical companies directly into Moderna a few days ago. I don't have much, but this seemed to be a solid move for now.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 16:34:14'] I shit you not. I sold a few hours *before* the vaccine news. I'm small game, but I would have easily made another 50%. Monday morning went up to like $67, a price it hasn't been at for WEEKS and WEEKS and I'm like, whatever, I'll just sell it. I'd seen lots of other news from other companies about vaccines. Particularly companies in other countries that won't nickel and dime people over price. I figured Moderna ain't gonna do much anymore. Not 3-4 hours later... my, whatever the *opposite* of midas fingers is, fucked me again. I'd been in since early April, so I mean, I was up 120%  but this stings a bit. Like THE DAY I fucking decided to sell. Luckily I was able to sell my Invio *after* it shot up.That said, Moderna likes to drop these hints to surge their stock prices.  Well, they've done it at least once before already. Not sure how serious things are this time, but last time it was kinda meh. Although prices shot up to $90 then did nothing but drop after that.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 18:33:37'] Lots of insider selling in modern. Not particularly long term bullish for me.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 19:25:07'] They are not in the lead, they are just loudest about it. And the results are iffy:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483"We conducted a phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 to 55 years of ago" ..."Solicited systemic adverse events were more common after the second vaccination and occurred in 7 of 13 participants (54%) in the 25-μg group, all 15 in the 100-μg group, and all 14 in the 250-μg group, with 3 of those participants (21%) reporting one or more severe events."There is a diagram describing the symptoms in the study. For people in this very low risk group, those symptoms are on par in terms of severity and more frequent than symptoms of COVID.Phase 3 will include individuals in higher risk groups, and there is a risk that this vaccine will have unacceptable impact on these groups.Now, vaccines from PFE and AZN/Oxford are ahead in the trials, but they are more careful in progressing and publishing, to avoid harming their reputation if something goes wrong.Moderna has never produced anything, so they have nothing to lose. I would be wary of them.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 07:58:54'] As someone who spends a majority of his time lurking here, I just wanted to say this is amazing and very much appreciated.Very nervous but exciting week coming up good luck to everyone
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 11:38:16'] tl;dr - early earnings reports and price multiples could also shine a light on what to expect as earnings season shifts into high gear.This is a great post, thanks for sharing! I have set aside literally this entire day to assess my biggest holdings (anything above 3% of my portfolio, to include AMZN, BABA, CWEN, GOOGL, MSFT, NFLX, NIO, NXPI, TSLA) and figure out what to expect with earnings, because there appears to be a trend emerging that inflated price multiples could be using this quarter's earnings announcements to dial back some inflated share prices. I believe that's what we've seen with companies like CYBE, INTC, and HYLN making significant shifts downward, and I believe it's also why NFLX owners shouldn't panic (I had my finger on the panic sell trigger this week, but thankfully backed away from the ledge). I'm worried NIO could be on the danger list.I'm working on putting together better data, and if my ideas are worth sharing, I may start a thread and post them, but just wanted to throw the price multiples drop into the bucket and remind people to continue to keep an eye out for lessons learned from the earnings reports that have already come in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-13 07:05:10'] I’m pretty excited about TMO and believe they are significantly undervalued. They’re not a pharmaceutical company, but they have the benefit of supplying a host of them. It’s akin to selling picks and shovels to the gold miners. You don’t have to pick the winner of R&D/trials. You just know that many companies are spending a lot of coin to get there, and companies like this are the beneficiaries. With over 90% of shares held by institutions, smart money seems to agree.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-13 06:36:46'] SENS for sure. FDA approval is coming and will rival DexCom in years to come. It’s more of a long game, Been sitting around $3 now, but looking for $12-15 EOY.

Finally awarded FDA approval and they are starting a marketing campaign to get their product advertised more.   They missed on earnings in the last report but the FDA approval was in Dec. I don't think sales had picked up yet.  Also, I don't think it can go any lower at this point. :)

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-13 10:09:42'] My pick has been Seelos Therapeutics because if their SLS- 002 trials go through positively, it can be a good sign for a new class of antidepressants (ketamine based). Ketamine's positive effects have been known for some time and now they are "being put to the test".There is a huge demand for this as there is a large segment of people who need acute help for their suicidal ideation and another large segment for whom the other class of antidepressants don't seem to provide a significant positive effect.Personally, I've used 4 different types of antidepressants and none of them have had a positive effect so I'm bullish also from the point of view of my personal experience.Positions: $SEEL 82 shares @ 3.6

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-14 06:19:19'] Probably Waste Management (WM). They still took a decent beating in 2008 (down about 30%) but did better than a lot of other major companies during that time (that were down 30-50%, some more). The early 2000s weren’t bad for them when a lot of companies suffered significant drops with the dot.com bubble as well. They did suffer a significant drop in 1999/2000 but I’m not sure from looking at the chart quickly if that was a split or something else that occurred. They deal with trash collection, dumps, and dumpster rentals which I feel is somewhat shielded from the harsh effects of a recession.It’s really hard finding companies that remain stable and perform decent during a recession. Basically everything gets hit, often hard, regardless of who they are and what sector they’re in. Stocks, by nature, are one of the more riskier means of investing out there. If you’re concerned about an upcoming recession or market crash but wish to remain in the market then your best bet is looking for companies with strong MOATs, little debt, experienced leadership, and good financials.

Even corrections like Feb and now only put it back to where it was a month or so prior and then it resumes going up. I use it as a bank account replacement and it's got a shitload better return than a stupid high-yield savings account. The need for rail freight isn't going away without American industry outright collapsing either, and I'd have ample early warning of that.I do keep a reasonable trailing stop on it though incase of sudden disaster due to the amount of money I have in it.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-08 11:22:55'] AMT/CCI, the cell tower REITs. People focus on high yield, but the cell tower REITs are quality dividend plays with growth/demand behind them. High yield does not automatically = good. People have hyped some awful dividend names on here for a while now just because of the high yield. All the Ford threads over the years - you get a yield in the mid single digits and a stock that's declined by nearly half in the last 5 years.  People talk up T - ATT isn't awful, but look at T's trailing total returns on Morningstar. The stock has done little over the years and that wasn't a good quarter last quarter. Look at high quality dividend **growth** names, not things that have been largely stagnant (or worse) just because they have a high yield. MSFT, AAPL, HD, JPM, etc etc etc etc.People need to focus on company first, yield second. If it didn't have the dividend yield, would you still buy the stock looking at the company itself?

Dividend payers in general* are older companies that are more well established and thus usually not growth names. Growth companies tend to not give out dividends since they need the money to grow. * This does not apply to REITS, BDCs, and MLPs and other outliers. Why do you want dividend stocks?

LTC pays monthly and is in the senior care industry.  It swooned in sympathy when OHI got clobbered, that was also a good time to buy, I added 300 shares.  WSR pays monthly and is in the small specialty shopping center business.  The management is overly happy with itself.  I sold my 1500 shares when it hit $14 something.  I would buy it again if it drops to $12.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 12:15:56'] As a beginner if you are looking to diversify across industries and build a solid foundation I might go with low expense ratio sector based ETFs rather than trying to pick one company from a bunch of different industries, then focus on one or two industries that you can research extensively and pick individual stocks from there. It's just an important to know the industry and competitors as it is to know the company, and trying to follow 8 industries will make this a lot harder. You might also want to mix in Small or Mid-cap index funds so you diversify both across sectors and across market caps.As the poster below said ARK ETFs are good (I'm an ARKG investor myself), but they are also entirely focused on growth (finding the next FAANG) and have high expense ratios. They also tend to overlap slightly, so they might not offer you the diversity and safety you're looking for.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 08:11:37'] Depends on your brokerage - they give a cost basis. Might need to wait a day or two.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 09:43:19'] Mine showed up yesterday. I did some research and it looks like you get 12 Viatris shares for every 100 Pfizer shares. my shares in PFE didn't change, but from what I gather it was just free shares of VTRS.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 12:09:09'] In my Merrill account, the tax lot details today show as follows:I got 117 shs of VTRS.They sold the fractional share for cash, I netted $15.14 cash for the fraction but I don't know what the fraction was.The tax lot details of the 117 full shares I now hold displays:86.8553 shs with a $7.44 basis30.1447 shs with a zero (blank actually) basisTotal basis on 117 shs: $646.15, or $5.52/sh.The shares are in a retirement account, so I have no incentive to do the mental gymnastics to try to figure out how they're getting those numbers.  Maybe someone else can look at that ratio and figure it out.Maybe it hasn't all settled out yet.Just because VTRS shares were trading $15 - $16 when issued and around the same of the first day of trading doesn't mean that's your cost basis.  It was a dividend paid in stock instead of cash.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 06:31:20'] Thank you for that comprehensive report on the upcoming week. Some very useful information in there! An addition I could make with regard to the continuation of the bull market is this info: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-26/hedge-funds-are-shorting-the-vix-at-a-rate-never-seen-beforeSuggests the continuation of the bull market, just slowly
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 08:10:38'] I remember when everyone was saying to short AAPL at $148. I rode that Warren Buffett train to the bank. It’s been a good few months, let’s see how earnings are.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 10:36:55'] I love these reports but the one think I don't see talked about here is the continued slowdown of the housing market. I buy rental properties and follow housing data and its disturbing how big the dropoff has been. Basically, not many homes are going up for sale and the ones that are aren't selling.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 13:32:59'] Thanks! I think AMDs price is a bit frothy right now, if there's a dip on earnings I'll load up on more though.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 08:25:48'] How do you think AMD will do?  I'm uncertain
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 13:43:56'] Should you really sell in May? What causes the markets to slow down during the rest of the year?
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 14:59:05'] Whats your thoughts on Kemper, Blizzard, AMD and Starbucks?I think im buying Kemper and Starbucks. Selling my AMD and Blizzard then buying them after the dip.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 16:08:39'] I'm bullish on Spotify and like that it was ticking up towards the end of the week. I think they will show positive results and it will bump 3 to 5 percent.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-28 18:08:45'] i have not been impressed with revenue gains, a lot of it is cost cutting/etc. i don't see how GE can report anything good when 3m didn't.

Here is a pretty good breakdown of each contender.\n\nGENETIC CODE VACCINES #mrna #pfe\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer candidates began Phase 3 testing in late July.\n\nNeither uses the actual coronavirus. Instead, theyre made with the genetic code for the aptly named spike protein that coats the surface of the coronavirus. Inject the vaccine containing that code, called mRNA, and the bodys cells will make some harmless spike protein  just enough for the immune system to respond, priming it to react if it later encounters the real virus.\n\nThese mRNA vaccines are easier and faster to make than traditional vaccines, but its a new and unproven technology.\n\nTROJAN HORSE VACCINES #azn\n\nBritains Oxford University and AstraZeneca are making what scientists call a viral vector vaccine but a good analogy is the Trojan horse.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 14:54:53'] No one should be buying vaccine stocks, profit margins are questionable. Better to bet on economies unlocking from vaccines.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 15:41:54'] Im into Pfizer. They pay a dividend and are so big they wont live or die based on vaccine.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 15:36:46'] Why not buy stock of companies like West Pharma that sell the little containers that it will have to be delivered in. Regardless of who wins the horse race, it still has to be distributed somehow. Also, I have read that the potential vaccines are incredibly volatile and need to be kept in sub-zero environments that pharmacies and hospitals don't readily have. I wonder who might be making those refrigeration units. Just idle speculation on my part. I am a total amateur at this, so there that is.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 15:26:14'] Moderna took money from DARPA to develop a bunch of its technologies.  Then claimed the patents for them without claiming DARPA was involved or FUNDED them.  Now if the govt wants said vaccines....  anyway Moderna fukt..DARPA Is investigating them...  there is nothing you can hide from DARPA...  nor can you win because they can call DCMA and just fine the shit out of you.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 15:03:54'] FLGT
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 23:30:24'] My bet is on PFE.. they were using the technology in 2017/2018 and when corona hit they started late 2019 to focus this new method on the corona virus.. that and using mRNA is going to be the new thing. I learned about it at university some 10 years ago and already back then people knew it was going to be the new standard
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 16:15:00'] The moderna and pfizer candidates require sub zero temperatures for storage, which pharmacies can't do. This severely limits where they can be given.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 16:24:44'] I put some money Into VBIV to see what would happen. They had 2 candidates that moved onto the next stage of testing and the only require one dose where other companies require two.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 13:45:53'] You are seriously late to the party. These all had huge runs and have lots of retail bagholders who bought in at the top.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 09:40:46'] The Oxford vaccine does, indeed, look promising, but I don't know how you can say it's the "most promising so far."  Based on the news I'm hearing, the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna Vaccine also both appear promising; and the Pfizer vaccine appears to be "ahead" from a schedule standpoint.That said, I think all three companies will see increases in stock prices if/when they get approval for a vaccine. No one company will have the resources to produce enough vaccine for the whole world. How much will each go up?  It's hard to say.  I own shares of both AZN and PFE, so I'd like to see them go up A LOT.  Realistically, I think 30% might be about as much as these two companies could expect to go up, but keep in mind I'm no expert on this sort of thing and I pulled that 30% number out of my ass, mostly, just based on what I've seen them move so far.

What are some of your fav dividend plays for the long term? I also like BRK.B, for although they dont pay out a dividend, they benefit off dividends'
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 23:28:24'] The best dividend play is the one that pays a nice 2-4.5% yield, still sees 10-15% annual growth and increases their dividends every year. For that I like HD out of all the ones you listed. For defense, LMT is nice. KO/PEP have great history, no rapid growth but theyre very consistent and weather market cycles very well.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 08:55:42'] Might be great time, might not be. If covid gets worse, there will likely be much bigger dips. Maybe try to DCA by adding small positions to solid companies while this plays out.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 09:04:51'] Definite maybe.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 12:13:33'] We're still near all time highs towards the end of an economic cycle. A great time to buy was 2012.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 10:45:01'] Yeah definitely wait a few months. Coronavirus just triggered the burst of the bubble of overvalued stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 10:28:33'] The thing thats worrying me is that the EU is keeping the shenghen zone open so there is free open border travel between all EU companies (apart from UK). Meaning any Italians with Covid 19 undetected could possibly spread it all over mainland Europe. Think this will dominate the next few months.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-24 11:00:26'] I am not buying. I think most stocks are overvalued as is, and plus Mr. Buffet state that people shouldn't buy or sell with these headlines from today. I tend to take the long approach to investing like him.
