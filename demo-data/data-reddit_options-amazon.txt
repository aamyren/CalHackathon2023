POST_TEXT: b'[https://imgur.com/a/kiXwNQ1](https://imgur.com/a/kiXwNQ1)\n\nIts a paper trade on tos, so any insight as to why so.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 07:30:01'] One idea is, even though the IV on the stock went down, the volatility on the options could have gone up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 08:01:00'] Stupid thought: is it because the dates are different in the 2 windows?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 08:41:54'] Gain/loss estimates based on the mark of the bid/ask get less accurate as the spread widens. Then add generous and unrealistic paper-trading fills on top of that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 10:13:52'] Price didn't move means Theta decay is eroding the values.IV dropping is also dropping the values.As you can see from the chart your trade has to have the stock move strongly up towards $132 or down towards $119 to start to profit.  Theta and IV dropping will both be headwinds to profiting . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 10:40:41'] The stock g he as moved from 127 to 121 in the last few days - the call end of the strangle was up and is probably piercing the down side of the strangle after the break even . That’s the whole point of a strangle or any spread .

POST_TEXT: b"I had been using 100 shares of Amazon stock as a vehicle for covered calls, but decided yesterday that the tiny stream of revenue just isn't lucrative enough to hold up all that cash is collateral. So I sold it off for a small profit yesterday from my original buy in November.  Back then, I was pretty bullish on Amazon but I'm not sure I can say that right now.\n\nSo I have approximately 11k in cash sitting around and I'm wondering where to go next. I don't know where to direct bullish moves (call buys, put sales).  I could ~~sell cash-covered~~ **buy** puts on stocks but I'm really not that bearish either.  \n\nDo you think just DCA on an ETF makes sense now? I know that sounds Buffett-like but that sure beats Cramer-like.\n\nOf course, you should feel free to read this post as a buy signal for Amazon because my record in such moves is quite solid.\n\n**EDIT**: comment about selling puts had wrong word.  Corrected visibly.\n\n"

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:12:47'] If you’re not bearish, then selling cash covered puts should be OK. One wants them to expire worthless most of the time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 13:57:06'] Seems to me you got AMZN near the lows and can make 1-150 a week (1%+) on your shares. Of course this whole thing could be giant bear trap and you timed it beautifully. But I'm not selling shares with $90ish dollar cost basis. There are good reasons the stock is where it is. I think they turn the ship around though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:35:39'] Kinda thinking along the same lines. I was mostly cash and decided to buy the 200ma retest. Couple etfs vti and qqq. Barring any changes holding from here out
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 12:18:53'] Kind of besides the point, but what about dcaing into an etf is Buffett like? Buffett has always been invested in stocks. I don't understand the enthusiasm behind etfs on the internet. It's like there is a collective wisdom that the layperson can't pick stocks, so an etf is the smart way to mitigate risk. Meanwhile, if you've ever looked at the stock market, you know stocks are correlated and their gains, if you measure them, dwarf the etfs that hold them. Any high market stock is going to move with the market and these happen to be some of the most popular brands. It's easy to pick stocks. Like you picked Amazon, that falls under the umbrella of what I'm saying. What is more difficult is timing the market and I think your question is really a timing the market question. In my opinion we are at a decision point for the market. Has it put in a low and will it continue upwards? Or will it recede to its lows and put in new ones? These conditions don't really fall into the criteria of any of any of my strategies, except selling naked options, which I don't do anymore. Maybe it's best to hold your money and wait for something more obvious?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 23:41:34'] Did something similar in that I sold the shares and bought Jan25 calls freeng some cash. Then been selling calls a month out against that to yield a premium of about 10% of the premium paid for the calls purchased. Then roll them a month at a time,Sometimes the calls sold would lead to a loss if executed but have been able to roll for breakeven at higher price.Till 2025 for AMZN to recover. Meanwhile make something on premium paid while investing cash freed elsewhere.There is risk similar to owning the stock but less money on the table.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:25:22'] Do not sell Put Cash secured puts. It turns you bullish! And when market crashes you lose a lot. Start looking at Delta Neutral (income) options strategies... But, do not lose time to look for stocks to use them. Just concentrate in one underlying...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 03:17:38'] I sell puts on TQQQ on red days when it is more than -5%. Works very well. I sell them 3 weeks out at a .30 delta. Usually, can close them at 50% in a few day's time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 05:39:19'] Sounds like you’re going from a conservative strategy to a gamblers // speculative strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 07:22:30'] Tesla, apple, rivn, amd are good buys at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 08:54:43'] First rule of successful covered calls: only sell calls on stocks or ETFs that are going up or are steady. Amazon has been going down so you are losing more on the stock than you are making on the calls. Also, when you say "tiny" revenue, you are selling calls that are far out of the money - so not much value to collect.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 09:34:11'] So my brokerage account is roughly $6,500 right now. I am working on diversifying in stocks that are under $20/piece AND that pay a dividend. I’m looking at this price point so I can buy 100 shares at a time and sell covered calls on the stock I own. One that I have right now is Ford stock. Currently $13.08/share and pays a 4.78% dividend. So I’m collecting dividends and options premium from covered calls. Another one I am looking at buying is AT&T. Currently $18.86/share and pays a 5.95% dividend. This week I sold a cash secure put that expired worthless, so I got a very small premium and didn’t touch the stock. I’ll sell another cash secure put this week and see if I pick up. Once I do, I’ll be selling a covered call with roughly 30-45 days till expiration. Another stock I love is GDV, and this is the exception to my rule. You cannot sell options on this, but it pays a 6.18% dividend that is paid out monthly. Currently I have this DRIP to buy more of the stock, so when I retire this nest egg will provide me with a nice monthly dividend that I can live on.I look at each of these stocks as resources that I can use to bargain with and leverage for premium. I also will run the wheel on stocks, especially if I want to keep that particular stock in my portfolio. TLDR; find cheaper stocks so you can diversify your portfolio.

POST_TEXT: b"so I have 1120 shares of amazon at $159 a share and I'm thinking of selling calls and puts to slowly start making my money back, now I've sold covered calls in the past but in all honesty, I don't know what to honestly do."
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:00:09'] Covered calls at $159 to begin with and as you make some money back. eg. 1.00 from 1 contract you can lower the break even price to a CC for $158 and collect more in credit and keep doing it.  Keep experimenting with it and to ensure your profitble my hard rule is selling CC at break even price or above. Another tip, when VIX is higher Volatility increases and so price of options increases which is ideal for CC.  I would  sell CC at varying price and varying times which means I would not enter int 11 contracts in 1 trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:04:26'] when I've had similar situations,  what I've done is start a call ladder.   Sell 1 call, 6 weeks out,  and each week sell another, until you have 6 covered calls.  By only covering half, it gives you some income, but in the case of a sudden spike up,  you could avoid having shared called away by rolling 1 call for 2.  I've been doing this with SHOP
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:31:09'] For starters, selling anything close to your cost basis will yield only a penny or two so not worth it.   If you are up for a little risk, 30 days out and around 110-115 you can get $1 so 10 contracts will yield about a $1,000.  That’s actually helping some.    If for some reason it really starts to run you should be prepared to roll up and out or let the position go for a loss and maybe wheel it if you want to stay in the position long term with CSP’s.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:43:40'] You have $178,000 position in AMZN, and your asking for advice on Reddit? Just roll the dice man. Seems to have worked pretty well for you so far. Best bet is sell cc’s just a bit OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:29:11'] I believe that AMZN is too far extended to the downside for this particular quarter. I would “rinse-cycle” them…. begin selling calls at strikes at least 1.5% above, weekly, then writing cash covered puts a strike or two below until filled. Yes this means you have to finally accept realized losses,   But at least from that point forward you’re increasing your balance. Don’t let FOMO stop you from making money. 💰
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:35:47'] If it were me,  I would hedge a percentage of the deltas (for me 25-35% if I were bullish and 50% if bearish).  So you have 1120 long deltas sell short dates 7-14DTE at .30 deltas,  then just roll them weekly.  If you see the stock rally add another call at the same strike until you are hedged to the tune of around 25-50% of shares.   You can buy them and sell them at your pleasure since you own the shares!  So for me it would be more about hedging all that long delta even if I was green in the trade I would still do this.  If I am red I do it more aggressively.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:09'] First and foremost, you need to decide if you are bullish or bearish on AMZN. Your past loss really doesn't matter. After you figure out your trade then decide which options are best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:44:26'] Sell the 30 delta calls against some of your stock.  Maybe 1/4 to start.  remember, if your stock gets called away, you can always sell puts and keep going. If the stock gets called away, it's not game over.  it's just part of the game.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 13:51:36'] What is your net stock cost including any put or call premiums you’ve collected up until now?  Or, did you buy 1120 shares outright and paid $159 per share?  You’re saying you’ve sold CCs in the past, how much has this collected?Ideally you’ll want to sell CCs at a strike above your net stock cost in case the share price spikes up and they are called away.  Read this for more info on the mechanics - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 14:32:44'] Sell 30 deltas with the dates staggered so weekly to 90 dte. The whole selling above cost average is for the birds. Your job is to generate returns not hold on to your sunken cost bias.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:43:35'] I have a good amount of money in Amzn too. Not nearly as much as you though. I bought 22 shares at 143. I’m holding steady. If it drops below $95 I’ll buy some more shares. I’m really looking at QQQ to make a decision. It’s been flirting with 315. If it does and holds…it’s a good sign for tech stocks. If it drops back down to 300 then I see a recession coming. Feels like speculation is boosting the market up. I don’t know if it can work long term. Aka fake it til you make it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:11:51'] Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Meaning, don’t plop down 1000 shares and sell 100 covered calls with one expiration date at one strike. Start with one covered call (100 shares of stock) and learn as you go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:27'] I will not hesitate to sell some consistently on a green day.  Selling cc cover at a lower price is risky.  For each contract itm you lose -$6K.  That is -$66K for 11 contracts.  If you paid way under 96 I would recommend cc for income. Even that is full of risk. I also read others comments but that sounds more risky.  Your current paper loss is a concern.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 17:22:28'] A covered put is short shares and a short put.  Is that what you mean?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:48:56'] For selling puts, are you bullish in Amazon? Are you willing to capture more shares if you were assigned Amazon at worst case? If so, what price? You’re going to picking up pennies if you sell covered calls on Amazon. Sure you can sell cc at a strike lower than your cost basis but is it really worth the risk of getting them called away and lock in the loss? If you’re no longer bullish about Amazon and just wanted to get rid of the stocks, then sure. Sell CCs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 21:09:57'] I bought a few hundred shares about 2 weeks ago at ~$99.  Did 1 buy write expiring this coming Friday for $101 … received $280 for that.  I think the price will get close to that by this Friday.  I’ve been watching a lot of indicators …so check those out before entering a position.  I’m watching for a run up to write a 4/21 contract and roll my other contract.  Also check out call open interest to see what expectation is …and also watch the daily call volume …and remember Amzn earnings coming next month …might see a run up.  I use Barchart and the Barchart app. I bought Amzn pre split for $120 and sold for $150 last year and have been waiting since then to jump back in.  I sold CSPs 4/21 $90 a few months ago thinking I might get assigned to no avail so I just decided to buy the stock …but received some nice premium on the puts.  Maybe sell some puts when the stock takes a dip to receive some more premium and lower your CB.  Put call ratio for 4/21 is .48 and the trend is up. I agree with others to sell a call or 2 (after a run up…even if it’s only to $102) then wait and see.  Pay attention to a possible pre earnings run up.  I’d choose .25 delta or lower in case there’s a good run up and you have to chase the call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:02:00'] I would not sell CCs on your shares, since the current price is so far below any reasonable strikes. If you sell CCs at say 110 or 115 and then the stock shoots up past that, you will regret having them called away. I think you should examine whether you believe amzn has good upside potential right now or you think you can utilize that capital more efficiently. If you think they are better opportunities, then sell and move on. If you think it can go back up to your cost basis, then hold. But selling any CCs below your cost basis has the chance of locking in a real loss
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:06:02'] Just reading your replies and not trying to be an ass, you need to dive a little deeper into options fundamentals and understand better which position your taking vs it’s outcome a little better before dicking around with a $100,000 position. I mean, even if Amazon is your only position you’ve got about a 6 figure portfolio so obviously some fucking around money available to you. Give an actual financial advisor a few bucks to talk you through this shit one on one and nail down your specific goals.Edit: $109905.60 Fuck what Reddit has to say brother, go seek professional advice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 04:38:26'] With that amount of money you could try practicing 0dte iron condors on paper. Buy back the losing positions and let the winners ride upwards and sell them for premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 07:31:26'] With amzn, isn’t it just easier to sell SPX calls since it’s such a big part of market? And European style settlement is so easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 09:23:42'] I agree with some comments. You'll first need to determine if your macro bias ..is bullish or bearish on Amzn & why U entered the trade (beside making $$). What's your time horizon for this trade? ( long or short term ). You scaled into Amzn w/avg price of $159 now, your bias feels slightly bullish or were you trying to avg lower hoping for bounce to exit @ breakeven? After U figured out your bias lean (bull or bear) and w/$100K + position in a single instrument do the homework (TA). This will determine how aggressive & directionality of your approach towards the options trade. Mistakes are inevitable, doing the analysis of instrument, group, sector will reduce but not eliminate chances of losses. Trading is about risk mgt and living to trade another day.

POST_TEXT: b'## Market View\n\n**Last Week **SPY rose 4.7% last week, outpacing to the upside the 2.7% move options were pricing. With that move higher implied volatility of options compressed slightly with the VIX now under 30. This week sees some of the largest cap tech stocks report. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta lead a busy week of earnings, with those 5 companies alone representing about 25% of the S&P 500. The dollar strength factors that have affected some reports already will receive attention in Amazons report.\n\nOn the economic calendar, well see GDP, Housing Prices and Consumer Confidence.\n\n**This Week **SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week at 29.7, its lowest levels since the first week of October, but still historically high.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**(via Options AI)\n\n* SPY**2.5%**(+/- $10)\n* QQQ**3.3%**(+/- $9)\n* IWM**3%**(+/- $5)\n* DIA**2.2'

I see an 11.58 percent in EBITA year after year. It barely beat the 10 percent mark. The EV/EBITA is 16.10 which is not good for me to buy it. So None of these stocks are good buys for me!

POST_TEXT: b"In first year of option trading, so I'm not proficient with all the lingo. Sorry in advance. \n\nI've been rocking poor man covered calls the last 2 months and have gotten lucky. Bought LEAPS on Shopify, Amazon, and Draftking.\n\nEverything has been shooting up after buying them, which is great. But when I sell PMCCs, I've had to roll alot and am -$1,000 on premiums.\n\nAny hot and fast rules for when to roll? I usually roll if the stock is at or above strike price a couple days before exp. I got burned (premium wise) when Shopify shot up last month and am trigger-happy now. Is this just the inevitable downside of my LEAPS going up?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 10:37:43'] A few things that may help.1) A diagonal spread (aka pmcc) can profit from the stock moving up slowly while selling and closing short calls, or if the stock "shot up" as the LEAPS call will gain value so both legs of the trade can be closed for any over all profit.  Look at the math, but if the trade was opened properly you can just close it up and go open a new one.  2) If you roll the short leg for a net credit then you are ahead and should have a profit if closed at some point in the future, even if rolling books a loss when traded.  Look at the entire position transaction and not just the roll trade.  3) Many set an order to close for a 50% profit to capture it and then open a new short call trade to keep things going.  If the stock has moved up too much then closing both legs should offer a net profit so may be better than rolling (see #1 above).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:57:17'] Listen and digest what Scottish Trader is telling you. No point in having a long leap if your short position is crimping you . Also when you roll you are closing your current position , forcing you to sacrifice premium . In my honest opinion , you aren’t experienced enough to be playing with PMCC’s. One day you will get caught in a snare , your short position will gobble up premium plus , and force you to cough up shares that cost more than your longs are worth - a lot more-  which is why a diagonal might offer more protection against a theta induced IV crush . You could very easily find yourself in a short squeeze if something skyrocketed on a binary event , a surprise announcement etc

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 13:17:11'] What did you pay? Add that to 110 and that is your breakeven (no profit) . If you think black friday , Bezo's birthday , will cause the price to rise, that could be a bad bet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 22:14:39'] I think you got a chance, it might go for that gap fill on the daily. I maybe would’ve gone with a monthly exp, the 12/16 110c is way more liquid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 22:22:28'] That long call is a bit more expensive now, so you likely bought at 2.35 earlier in the day Friday.  You’ve made 16, meaning you have 219 to go with about 40dte as of Monday before breaking even.  That’ll happen one of two ways.  One is a sharp move toward the strike since you’re already close, but sharper than today’s. The other is for the value of a share to exceed 112.35 before expiration at which point you STC, get your paid premium back as well as anything exceeding that.Edit:  Although I’m rarely a long option player at all, your better move may be the more distant strike with a less expensive premium and good volatility.  For example, -AMZN221223C130 & 135 will open Monday at around .35 & .23 respectively.  Sharp moves toward those strikes are much more likely to exceed the premium and produce some profit early than being close and nearly requiring the strike plus the premium at expiration.  You’d then STC early, take the smaller prize, and move on to the next.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 19:39:33'] I‘d be pretty careful about trading options in the future if you aren’t aware of how/when any impact from Black Friday/Cyber Monday will impact the stock price. That data won’t be available until after your option expires. Not to be rude, but you just bought a lottery ticket for yourself. It might pay, it might now. I hope it does for you but continue to educate yourself via this sub and other means.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 09:35:39'] none of the reason you gave are good imo. However it very well turn out to be a good trade. If no fed member comes out and tell the market to cool off + typical year end rally could push amzn over the line. The snag will be the Dec CPI print, if it spikes up again then you are screwed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-17 18:24:45'] Since it's a tax advantaged account, it won't matter that shares would be called away, in the event that that would happen, as there are no tax implications. More than likely, it will dip below that price sometime after they've been called away so you can buy them back, or you may already have enough money to re-buy them & repeat the process in case you don't want to wait for a dip.I am guessing you've already thought of this, but do keep in mind that after the 20 for 1 split, deep OTM call premium will be nowhere near what it is now & may be a bit trickier to manage not having shares called away.

If you are going to buy a long put it is recommended to buy at least 3 months minimum worth and close to ATM and ITM to have a chance. You can always sell to close earlier, or at earnings. If your wrong this gives you more of a chance to beat theta. Don't be cheap , because you get what you paid for when buying long puts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 11:01:29'] I would not compare a monster like amazon to a PoS like snap. Snap is a meme stock like GME or AMC.Personally I do not trade earnings. 1-2 weeks after earnings I would look to enter a trade from the bullish side if AMZN is below 90, a neutral trade b/w 110-130. Anything above 135ish is a call ratio with no downside risk.Always sell something against that long option to counter the effects of theta decay.EDIT: Actually snap is worse than a meme stock because it's social media... a cancer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 08:41:30'] I think SNAP has less to do with Amazon personally but with ad driven revenue that’s why stocks such as Goog and Meta fell. I think this drop in SNAP has been priced in for those stocks and if they beat, they’ll rocket. If they miss, I am unsure how bad they’ll drop. For AMZN, I think they may be okay as well, but it depends on revenue entirely and with a downturning economy, who knows.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 10:24:54'] Here are some key numbers so you know what to expect from put positions through earnings:[AMZN 122p 07-29](https://earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=AMZN&pos=;;AMZN.122.0.p.07-29s;;)\- Break even needed at day of release, so Thursday: -2.4%\- IV crush loss on the option price Thursday: -18.8%\- Average theta decay by day \~-14.3%: from Monday to Tuesday, position will lose -11.2% and last day Thursday to Friday, it will be -32.6%)So, if no stock move, you're looking at \~18.8% plus somme -30% of theta decay by Thursday, so overall you risk losing 50% of the position if no stock move.A slight +1% move in the stock will make the loss by Thursday to \~70%.If the stock goes in your favour:\- For -3% on Thursday, profit on the position will be \~20%\- For -4%, it would be around \~50%(numbers from graphs on the [link](https://earnings-watcher.com/#/positions?symbol=AMZN&pos=;;AMZN.122.0.p.07-29s;;), make sure to hit run)&#x200B;Now one interesting thing to look at is how much did AMZN move in its past earnings, to quickly see likelihood of such moves. Here are some stats for that:\- Average around earnings: +/-5.4% with std deviation of \~4.2% => most moves are from +/-1% to +/-9%After earnings, stock price:\- Kept same direction of move for 1.2 days on average\- Reversed initial direction 65% of the time&#x200B;So looks like a 2.4% break even is not so bad, though betting on a direction is risky as you should be ready to take a \~50% loss.Hope this helps, cheers1

POST_TEXT: b'I\'m talking about e.g. [Dynamic Hedging](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Hedging-Managing-Vanilla-Options/dp/0471152803) by Nassim Taleb, or the "replication" that they talk about when teaching Black-Scholes pricing.\n\nBut in reality who does this "dynamic hedging" / "replication"?\n\nAFAIK = as far as I know. AFAIK, very few (if any) retail traders do this. AFAIK, "replication" is esoteric black magic reserved for the bigger players on trading desks within banking institutions or hedge funds.\n\nAFAIK, the vast majority (if not all) retailers just create a suitable risk profile with only options (iron condor, credit spread, etc.). They stay in options only and don\'t bother to "replicate" anything by trading the underlying.\n\nIf I\'m wrong, I\'d like to learn about it.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 07:25:54'] The first thing I would say is that the Taleb book is for market makers, by a market maker. Additionally, a fair amount of time is spent discussing hedging exotic options retail will never encounter in practice, such as binary and barrier, and it can be hard to figure out in the text what is actually applicable for retail.A better handling of the issues and techniques for retail dynamic hedging is in Sinclair's *Volatility Trading*, and an explanation for why retail shouldn't bother is in his *Positional Option Trading*. For a good handling of what market makers do and have to deal with, his *Option Trading* has a great chapter on that.Rather than duplicate it here, I'll refer to a recent reply I made on this subject:[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/12j0n2y/comment/jfwn2ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/12j0n2y/comment/jfwn2ed)  Finally, I would recommend watching u/esInvests interview with Euan Sinclair here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDA449Fkwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDA449Fkwj4)In here Sinclair explains that it's often best for retail just to manage risk with position sizing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 07:18:48'] You either have to be doing high frequency trading or you have to accept that every time you hedge you are locking in MTM losses on your short or real losses on your delta hedge. It's a volume game because you are averaging a few bps return on every position across a broad book.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 07:59:12'] Delta hedging via delta 1 products is probably not that uncommon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 08:23:45'] I thought dynamic hedging was done in real time, and mainly used for arbitrage. Doesn’t seem possible without high frequency algo trading.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 17:59:11'] Most option traders hedge delta (if only with a stop loss which triggers when a sufficient loss has been caused by mostly delta).  The frequency (e.g. how “dynamic”) and whether they do it with underlyer or options is only variable among most traders.  Many (including myself at times) use the underlyer sometimes.

Like others have suggested I wouldn’t do anything till after Wednesday, more than likely the fed will pump the brakes on this as it doesn’t align with their goals.

Based on this price action history, I would close it. If you want to hold puts, I'd say you can get contracts again after the Fed meeting.

The two types of options are puts and calls, so this is really confusing.If I deduce correctly you are asking if it would be a good idea to buy a 270 call expiring 3/31.If you’re right about an eminent strong bull move it would be a nice position to have, if you’re wrong and the price only creeps up you will lose.Any time you decide to go long on an OTM option be prepared to lose 100%. Realize it’s a gamble. Long options should only be held short term, don’t wait around until expiration hoping for a move.If I had the same expectation as you and wanted a long option I’d buy the 4/21 $225 Call for $32.00 instead of 3/31 $270 call for $2.10 this will have more consistent reliable moves relative the underlying. Boring and consistent is better than lotto ticket excitement.I prefer to sell options so I’d be more likely to sell the 3/31 $260 put for $10.50 though. Just be sure you’ve got the $26k buying power free.…maybe ask chat GPT to rephrase your question for you?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-13 22:50:04'] You may be destined to having about a 34 minute career in options trading.  -MSFT230331C270 +1 would cost you about $215 at today’s Close.  At 18dte, your long call would need to jump in value quickly, at which time you take profit and sell to close.  Without following MSFT, meaning I don’t have all the facts, I have serious doubts it will make a sustained move towards 270.  Your only real chance is an early bump where you possibly make $50, and you then get out.I don’t like it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-13 22:46:40'] MSFT could hit that target but I don't know if the new version of Chat GPT would be the catalyst.If you think CPI numbers tomorrow and the FOMC meeting next week will be favorable for risk assets (tech), then it's game on.What I'm getting at is the market as a whole will need to be bullish in order for MSFT to go up. Market first, stock second.If banks continue to fail and the market shits the bed, the new version of Chat GPT isn't going to help MSFT price much. In my opinion .

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 14:58:08'] VIXY uses short-term VIX futures as their holdings, and is really not designed for long-term holding.  Basically it's designed to drop in value over time from my understanding.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 14:57:18'] I think the VIX rises on market volatility rather than just a drop in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 15:22:16'] VIXY is not designed for long term holding. While the VIX index goes up and down with the price of SPX options and somewhat reflects the level of fear and demand for hedging in the overall market, the VIX is not something that can be owned. So VIXY holds VIX futures which have an unfortunate tendency to decline with the passage of time. In mid August 2022 the VIX was at a similar level to today but VIXY has lost about 1/3 of its value in that time.

Volatility and Leveraged ETFs have slippage and drag, meant for intraday use. It becomes extremely noticeable on futures with significant contango.I would use /VX, /VXM, or the VIX. Even though VIX is not the current volatility contract, you can do options in there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 20:28:08'] Let’s say you buy 5 shares for the 2485 AMZN closed at on Friday. That’s $12,425 on an investment. If that’s a large portion of your portfolio and the share price goes to $2000 before split, you’re pretty far underwater and would have to write pretty far OTM calls post-split until the share price rebounded. If you’re okay with that possibility, and you feel that $2485 is a good valuation, I say go for it. But yes, IV typically spikes post-split. You could also wait for the split and start your strategy with a Cash-secured put, ensuring your starting point is closer to current stock price. A lot can happen in the next 3-4 months before the split.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-23 18:32:22'] What’s the current *market* IV gap between two identical ATM calls w except where one is 5/1 and the other is 5/8?Keep in mind market price drives IV not the other way around. Think about it: implied vol means the volatility *implied* by a given market price for the option. Also....I don’t follow AMZN but consider that expectations are through the roof for them. If they post a blowout quarter....the stock may be flattish. And if they give even slightly squishy outlook, lookout below. AMZN is a ‘safety stock’ right now - a lot of people are in it as a hiding spot and if AMZN proves not to be a hiding spot then they all leave. Do what you want to do, I’m not making a rec at all, but 1) fundamentals matter, and 2) ‘whisper’/expectations matter more.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-23 18:42:25'] I like this strategy. I have employed a similar strategy many times, quite profitably.There are a few things I would adjust in your strategy:* Given that AMZN earnings are on Apr 30th, you still have several days for the stock to move, and also a few days for volatility to go up. So, I would increase your short call to a higher strike.* Secondly, as IV goes up, you will benefit from vega. As the stock goes up, you will benefit from delta. As time goes on, you \*should\* benefit from theta, but you will not, as the vega move will outweigh the theta benefit.* Next, your cost calculation: you said this spread costs you $118. But you did not include the hidden cost of the margin \[which will be $4000 in your example, because of (2540-2500)\*100\]. So your actual cost is $4118.* I would, instead, do a true calendar spread, for example BUY 5/8 2500 Call and SELL 5/1 2500 Call. This would cost you $1375 (because no margin). The dollar returns will be similar, on much lower capital at risk. ... \[or pick a higher strike, based on my previous point\]* Finally, the earnings announcement will be after the market closes. So, on the final day, BEFORE the market closes, I would close out the entire position, since the IV crush is going to kill you. I would then replace this diagonal spread with an iron condor, also expiring on 5/8.* And then, close out the Iron Condor on the day after earnings.et voila!Hope this helps.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-30 14:13:10'] I played this - exited earlier.Each contract of the 2500/2540 diagonal spread netted $650, while the calendar spread 2500/2500 netted about 450.

If you adjust ic drop to just -30% , the guaranteed profit range narrows to small price range. Being said that, try have this play until earnings n if you see significant profit , book it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 14:08:14'] My thought is that, at least for the next few months, ev adoption will slow as people choose to continue servicing the current cars they have instead of spending on a new ev. OEMs cranked up average selling prices the last few years and shrunk incentives. Incentives are slowly coming back, but with current rates and general market sentiment, I think new ev sales suffer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 16:32:39'] People may hold on to their car for longer as they make spending cuts, so rather than buy a new car, try fix their old one and spend more money in auto parts stores. Or, they put off fixing their car completely, and spend no money in auto parts stores.Could go either way imo.The second hand car market is falling, which indicates this portion of the population is already hit, and not looking to upgrade, but maybe stay with what they have for longer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 08:40:04'] First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?Those aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.-------------------For the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.The best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.You don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.Now, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.For now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.You can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolioAsset allocation calculators:https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocationhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulationhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculatorhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:27:36'] I personally hedge with SQQQ.  Paying 20% in capital gains is certainly better than losing 25% of your portfolio value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:29:56'] If OP has been investing for 10 years it has been in a declining interest rate environment so the strategy has been great.  There is nothing wrong sticking with it but I wouldn’t expect the same results as the macro backdrop has changed and what worked the last ten years won’t necessarily work the next ten years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:57:39'] Hedging is twice the brain damage of market timing.  If you're hedging a potential bear, and get one, when will you take the hedge off ?   If you're hedging a bear and get a bull, how much hedge pain will you tolerate ?   If you are using options then time is money!  The more deltas you want the more the time will cost you.   Hedging each winning name would be wow: That's a lot of hedging!  Can you beta-weight to SPY or QQQ ?   You might look at futures.  /MES hedges 50 shares of SPY and /MNQ hedges 41 shares of QQQ.    /ES and /NQ are 10 times bigger.   Efficient and no pesky theta to pay.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 18:01:43'] You can sell a box hedge around each of your stocks, to negate a move in any direction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 10:21:05'] First off, this isnt a "potential" bear market. It is one. Secondly, the problem with buy and hold "strategies" is that you really have no way to know when to sell...and there is always a time to sell. Paying taxes sucks I know.1.) Tax loss harvesting2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.Theres an "Inverse Cramer" ETF coming online next month.Fortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.So step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out. Then overlay the above suggestions to tweak how much beta you want to this market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 08:25:51'] What do you mean by, "how options work"? Natenberg is THE textbook about how options work. It's not just a recipe book of strategies.McMillan is good too. Between those two, I don't think you can find better deep dives on "how options work." All the rest are more practically how-to books on trading. Or more tutorial like "Trading Options For Dummies".
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:18:13'] As I said before....Reading books is great... stay away from trade paperbacks. Natenberg is the bible , Hull is a college text 25 years ago required reading for students who built option software. I liked Chriss. NONE of these will teach you trading, although you really should read Natenberg (figure 9 months, then reread once a year). McMillian... one step above trade.Tasty has the best stuff. They SELL options, they do not try and figure out the next market move, and when they do are often wrong and say so in advance. There motto NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING, at least on future moves. If that is not the way you want to go , then listen to all the guys on these Reddits, buying an option for a $1, and cashing out for 10k.If you want to try Tasty , sign up , besides the courses, listen to some stuff daily it is all recorded on their site, and some on youtube. The book on their site pushes their outlook selling strangles or Puts. It is the closest thing to a book that teaches trading.If you are going to trade then get a trading app NOT ROBINHOOD. ThinkorSwim is great , and Tastyworks is Tasty's entry (they wrote ThinkorSwim 20 years ago).3
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 06:14:53'] If there is one book you need to read, that is Sheldon Natenberg's book you mentioned. It is deep enough  and starts with simple forward contracts, like buying a land, before delving into options. Reading the book twice or three times (and preferably doing the exercise book successfully) will give you such knowledge, that you will shake your head at the simplistic, inflexible and sometimes  dangerous tastytrade strategies/videos and their cherry-picked and incomplete "market measure" studies as well as their terrible risk management and one-sided trading tips. Been there, done that. Options are hard.Getting back to your question, if you REALLY and I mean REALLY wanna delve deep into the fundamentals of options, you need to read "Options, futures and other derivatives" by J.C. Hull and do the exercises. You need to have good mathematics knowledge for some parts. Calculus, Statistics, etc. It is college textbook and the Bible for quantitative derivative trading. It's almost as thick as McMillan's (which is obviously also great). McMillan goes into more detail than Natenberg and discusses trades management more than Natenberg, but doesn't have much math in it. Sinclair, as someone also mentioned is another good source.Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 08:34:26'] I have read McMillan on Options. It's really good. Does anyone have read both this book and option as strategic investment? Do I need to get the other one? What are the main difference of these two books? Thanks!

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 13:13:31'] When working the Wheel, meaning crowding that short put strike less conservatively, price movement up really doesn’t matter to me.  If the underlying price goes up on anything above 7-10dte, the option is going to offer you some money to leave.  A radical rise allows you to leave and keep a big chunk of the premium.  Whatever the BTC let’s you keep, figure out how many shares that’ll get you at the original intended strike price when subtracted from the new underlying price, 5 shares, 15 shares, whatever, and buy them.  Then you look at the underlying again, evaluate, and either sell another put with a higher strike or wait a bit for it to settle back into the zone it’s found comfortable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 15:54:10'] Keep selling the premium. Would you have sold the shares that day if you would have bought them? Probably not, using hyperbole in the market causes emotions to react, which will ultimately cause of catastrophic loss.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 16:47:33'] I’m currently in a similar situation. I’ll describe my situation and allow you or others to take what you will from it (probably nothing) Anyways, I own 1800 shares of WBD at $14 and Im confident I’ll look back wishing I had bought more. Problem is that I’m down to my last 5k cash avail. I decided I want to wheel options until I feel the stock is ready to breakout in an upward trend at which point I’d use the earnings to outright buy the stock….so I decided to sell 4 of the 11.5 put options with 30-45 days til expiry. This is my first time selling puts. I’m very bullish on this stock so I was scared to employ a new strategy initially. I’m glad I did though because I’m learning a lot. Just 2 hours later I saw an article in the news tab announcing there was unusual options activity. Someone sold $5,294,036 worth of puts. I took a screenshot of the article and sent it to my dad cause it was reassuring to know I wasn’t alone in deploying this strategy. I had told him what I wanted to do with the put selling weeks before all this happened and how I was just scared to try it even though I understood everything. I played the what if I lose all my shit and then some because I misunderstood the risk or premise of the strategy itself. Like I could’ve bought straight shares like my dad did and now I have a tiny bit of fear about it. My dad only has one strategy, buy low and sell high and it’s gotten us in some sticky situations so I’m constantly looking for ways to mitigate risk and one up him. Hope my though process can show that you’re not alone in that fear and what if crap. I think it really comes down to the timeframe and how badly you want to own the stock. If you think this is advice then don’t take it cause it wasn’t. Simply laying out some discussion material about my thoughts when I do the same thing.Edit: this is basically me venting

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 08:10:32'] Just buy shares through DCA. Even if you only can buy 1 share a month, that's fine. Solves all of the problems of not knowing when the recovery will happen vs. theta decay, as long as you are really confident in your long-term bullish forecast.Fractional share brokerages are perfect for this situation. You can spend $50/month and DCA 100 delta exposure for 100% of your holding time with no theta decay.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 21:45:06'] Dude forget options, just buy shares and thank me 30 years from now. You have what is likely a once in a lifetime chance to own Amazon at these prices. This is a company that outside of recessionary conditions is making $25 BILLION a year in net income, expected to do $500 billion in revenue this year and $560 billion next year AND STILL PROJECTED TO CONTINUE GROWING at an incredible clip. You’re paying about $900 billion for a company that has the best e-commerce, and cloud opportunity of any company in the world going into the future and is already the undisputed king in these sectors. MOAT? Think of what it would take for a competitor to come in and compete with them, the billions in infrastructure and talent required, there is no one even close to the level of market dominance that Amazon already has and no one with enough money to even put up meaningful resistance.$911 billion for a company with $186 billion in assets, and $19 billion in cash, which means you’re really paying about $700 billion for the undisputed king of e commerce.Think ahead into the future, do you think online shopping will become bigger or smaller? Cloud/web services? I doubt brick and mortar retail will stage a meaningful comeback any time soon. Amazons total addressable market is expanding every year AND their share of that market is still expanding.They’re in so many different businesses already, streaming media, e-commerce, advertising, groceries, cloud computing, the list goes on and in, soon to be gaming, hardware, software, services, delivery/logistics etc..This is a company that is competing with, and winning against, companies like Netflix, Disney, Microsoft, Shopify, google, Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Walmart… They’re slowly taking over the world one sector at a time and you have 1 shot to get in at these prices.Options will give you crumbs, you should seriously consider shares and get the whole cake.I wouldn’t be surprised if after this recession amazon goes on a decade long bull rally and ends up somewhere near $5 or $6 trillion. 30 years from now they could be paying quarterly dividends HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE OER SHARE. Don’t mean to write a whole novel but companies like Apple and Amazon are in a whole league of their own, with the advantage going to Amazon in my opinion. It’s a company that’s designed to take over nearly every sector in the worldwide economy, while apple is limited to hardware, software, and services.They will introduce all sorts of whacky shit that no one is even thinking of right now. Imagine putting Fedex and UPS out of business because they get so good at automated drone delivery that sending an item through the mail costs 10x as much.Imagine a 90% reduction in google shopping searches because it’s easier, cheaper, and better to just buy everything from Amazon instead of shopping at individual websites. Imagine instead of companies building websites to sell products, they list it on Amazon instead. Imagine amazon acquiring Netflix and Disney and integrating all streaming media into one amazon prime membership instead of people having accounts with 5 different services. Imagine shopify going out of business because it doesn’t make sense to have a e-commerce website any more. Imagine every 99% of the western world having an Amazon prime membership because they have expanded and dominated all the other countries out there. Imagine no one hosting their own servers, and businesses not having any computer hardware anymore because it’s better do just cloud compute with AWS.20 years ago the bulls were saying imagine shopping malls closing down because e-commerce is better, it’s already happening and the rate is increasing.Just crazy to think of what this company is going to be doing in 39 years, all the different lies they will have their finger in, the truckloads of money they will make for their shareholders.Shares dude. Don’t settle for a few thousand bucks today  when you can have hundreds of thousands or even millions down the road simply by exercising a little patience and taking ownership in something.

Maybe you'll get lucky.    However, the best thing that you could do would be to forget about options and spend 6 months learning as much as you can about options.  You need to understand the ins and outs of each strategy as well as how to manage them in up and down scenarios.  Then, you might have a shot at surviving the game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 18:50:17'] I am bullish on AMZN.  I currently have one short put contract on $86 strike with expiration of 16DEC22.  It's a wheel strategy; I want to own AMZN at these levels for a long term hold.I have also hedged this position with a long put spread on $87/$88 strikes on the same expiration.  All of these positions result in net credit of $0.22.  It would have been greater but I didn't apply the hedge until 2 days later.I arrived at this position due to the oversold signals from RSI.  I would eventually do the reverse of these options once they show overbought signals in a few weeks or months.  If it takes longer, then I am comfortable holding AMZN in my portfolio.  It's a profitable company and it's name is just about as ubiquitous as "Gillette" is to the razor market.I hope this helps you come to a decision on the trade.  Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:40:06'] I’m still heavily bearish on this market and because of that I’m bearish on Amazon.  The Fed is in Layla land if it thinks it can engineer a soft landing while beating the inflationary monster.  Not gonna happen.  Which means less people buying, less revenues and yes, lower stock prices.  Amazon is going down, way down.  They won’t see growth again for another five years when this is said and done.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 21:15:27'] They're still absolutely the 600 lb gorilla in the someone-elses-datacenter world, and arguably the same for online sales, though deservedly have gotten a ton of negative press for employee relations.  I see them as a longer term (1-2 year) buy and hold, but I also kind of suck with money, so there's that to consider.As said elsewhere,  they are pricey for a beginner.  There are better choices for you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 01:13:01'] I mean, yeah, probably at some point Amazon it’s going to stop talking and climb back up, but in the past year, from down 10% to 20% to now 40 something %, it kept looking like the it’s reached its low but it kept going down. Sure, at some point it’ll go up, but what if it tanked more then recovered slowly over a year?  You’d have your capital tied up and then with time decay, you probably wouldn’t make a killing in that case. You have to decide upside vs. lost potential. What can you make with that money otherwise? If you planned on buying something and holding a year, then you could go in smaller and see, but I don’t think you’d make a killing unless the market reversed and took off. Not saying you’re wrong; just saying that people have waited for a reversal for two years and lost a lot of money, and they market is still squeezing out brick after brick.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 08:41:03'] The market is cooling off and a recession is likely.  AMZN had amazing numbers while the economy was hot, so these will make tough comps to beat for at least several quarters . . .The stock is down considerably, so some of the above may already be priced in, and since you are bullish, it might make sense to sell puts if you are good with holding the shares if assigned.  Selling 42 dte around the .30 delta could bring in about $2.50 at the 83 strike and a net stock cost of $80.50 if assigned.  The Trefis estimate still shows a $160+ valuation, so this still seems cheap in the big picture.  These puts could be rolled to lower that NSC even more before being assigned and might avoid assignment altogether.  If assigned then selling covered calls at or above the NSC can keep bringing in premiums and lowering the stock cost more and more.  This is called the wheel strategy and is popular when you have a stock you don't mind owning.  IMO long calls are more of a gamble as you will not make anything if the stock stays sideways or doesn't move up enough as IV dropping and theta decay eat away the value . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:11:43'] Put credit spread or a Call debit spread are good for beginning.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 20:27:16'] Amazon stock analysts develop future earnings forecasts and ascribe them probabilities.  Then they intentionally understate these probabilities to be conservative and build in a risk premium.  Then the stock price, and all derivatives, are priced to be “risk neutral” - meaning on average you expect to make more money being long Delta and lose money being short Delta.This, by the way, is true for every positive Beta asset, not just AMZN.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 19:35:07'] Leaps.It’s weak Q4 outlook. Not weak earnings per-se. OTM leaps for Jan 24 -Jan 25. Or deep ITM calendar spread.

POST_TEXT: b'So, lets assume i have 5k remaining buying power AFTER i sold a CSP on amazon. If i get assigned it means i will have to fund my account another 6 to 7k to buy the shares or its already calculated that after a possible assignment scenario i will have 5k remaining on my buying power?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 17:27:59'] If it is cash secured the amount required to cover the assignment is already subtracted from the buying power.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 20:19:44'] Your original post says you have the Amazon put as cash secured. This means you have enough cash as collateral to buy the shares if assigned. However, you also mentioned it is in margin. So I'll also answer this too, under the assumption you have your terminology wrong.The buying power requirements for a short put (on margin) is similar to buying the shares at the strike price (on margin). You won't lose buying power on assignment, but you will lose buying power due to the value of the shares dropping. All assets have something called a loan value and margin value. The loan value drops as the market value of the shares drop, thus increasing how much buying power is being used. To remain solvent in the eyes of your broker, you must maintain positive buying power.This is generally speaking and you should speak to your broker to see if they do have different margin requirements for short puts and long shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 19:47:22'] Cash secured means that cash gets tied up when you sell that put, it’s deducted from your buying power until you buy to close or it expires worthless. Are you sure you’re selling cash secured puts and not puts on margin?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 20:58:30'] The assignment is already factored in when they reduced your buying power after you sold the put. You would be buying the shares on margin if assigned and just need to worry about keeping above margin maintenance after being assigned so you dont get margin called later on.

Also somebody can just be locking in some tail risk on different types of spreads. If I’m going to close a short position and there’s no liquidity in the stock, the obvious thing to do is buy deep itm (no extrinsic premium). Buy my stock back at the open market(to close), price runs up, I sell the calls to close, and then I’m re-initiating short/adding at a higher price as I most likely know I’m the reason for the price run up. Some call it manipulation, but it’s just market forces at work in an illiquid market where short squeezes happen frequently

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 17:04:55'] "could be" doesn't mean "will be".  Do yourself a favour and look back at past corrections/crashes.  A good place to start is SPX in May 2001, which exhibited similar price action to what we are seeing right now.  Back then, following a 30% decline over about 6 months, SPX broke the 100d SMA and touched the 200d SMA after rallying 22% off the "bottom".  Sounds familiar, right?  After touching the 200d SMA, SPX then pulled back just like SPX did this week.  If you were trading then, you might have thought it was just a little pullback, it'll come back up next week.  Sure enough, it did come back up a little for a few days allowing plenty of punters to buy up all of the inventory that the big money was trying to sell, but that was as far as it got before SPX fell a further 40% over the next year.That doesn't mean the same thing will happen now, but you could have been fooled back in May 2001 just as easily as you could have been fooled in March 2002, May 2008, June 2010, Oct 2011, Dec 2015, Nov 2018, or possibly now.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey Guys, I am learning about call options, I was guessing Amazon stock might go up since there is Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I assumed 3100 was a decent estimate and I bought 2 calls on AMZN 3100 , expiring Dec 04 for 106$, at that time the stock was around 3020$ . I am noticing that even though the stock price is above strike price (hovering about 3100 to 3150), the call value is tanking. Last week the call price went upto 150$ when the stock crossed 3100 and this week it is around 95$ even though it is above 3100. I could not understand the co relation which I was thinking as linear. Any advice will be great and Thank you!'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:09:22'] Why did you not start with 1 contract like Ford or GE to get a feel of outcome before committing massive premium?
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:10:05'] Time value of money (theta) and Implied Volatility.  Google these.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:06:27'] if you have bought calls before earnings, then value could have dropped due to IV crush. check the IV chart for your Calls(not for AMZN stock, but your call)
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:15:07'] Your break even is $3206. IV crush and theta are working against you. Your contract only has $18 of intrinsic value at the time of this post. Theta is only going to accelerate extrinsic value loss so if you dont think AMZN will hit $3206 by 12/4 you better close your position at a loss.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:35:52'] Your theta is imploding due to the expiration being quite close. Options are built to fail due to the time value eroding exponentially as you approach expiration. Additionally implied volatility plays a big part in the pricing. If there was an earnings report recently, your IV would be imploding.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 12:01:39'] IV. If IV was high when you bought, and is now lower, then your option value drops. Don’t buy when IV is high
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 13:16:55'] APPLE premium is quite affordable. Assume you try 1 contract  call  \~6 months away. It is reasonably safe.  I surely hope it will be $130.... You can always close it before taking profit and run. My commission is 65 cents x 2 round trip.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 11:25:28'] IV is probably going down. The underlying stock price is only one factor in an options value. Trading on events like that or like earnings probably wont be a good strategy for options trading since the volatility is usually already priced into the options premium in the lead up to the event because there is uncertainty about the outcome of the event, and once the event like earnings or black friday is done then IV will fall, because the event that is causing the uncertainty is over which will make the option price also fall.

Because the actual market value of stocks being traded is $405 billion, whereas the market value of options traded is going to be significantly less than $450 billion (when WSB buys a TSLA 2000 strike call, that call has a notional value of $200k, but the market value of that call is significantly less). If we're going by notional value, futures and futures options have significantly higher notional values.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 18:32:45'] Um, excuse me. Do any of you actually know what notional value means? Jfc this sub is sad sometimes. Notional value is the value of the underlying shares in the option price. In the US, options are on 100 shares of the underlying asset. If I pay $3.50 for an option on a $100 stock. I pay $350 for the contract on a notional value of $10,000. If I wanted the same value on a stock purchase I would have to actually pay $10,000. The notional value of options surpassing the notional value of stocks means absolutely nothing because their transaction basis differs by two orders of magnitude. You’re comparing a state fair competition sized pumpkin to a miniature pumpkin that sits on your desk.

If they shut down regional sellers but allow billion dollar companies to still maintain services, the government is giving an unfair advantage to my competition.  Either we all go down, and everything stops except US MAIL, or we all are allowed to provide our goods.  Does Amazon and many other large companies hope that they get the ability stay open when everyone else has to close?  Sure, but it is not legal to do this unless we are in an extended situation and only if the US Government takes possession of Amazons services until the crisis is over.  No one should profit from an extended closure, I don't care how much amazon invested in home delivery.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-07 05:40:29'] Too much for me to try to do. I just take gains quickly. I only buy at very clear spots based upon a variety of technicals and sell very quickly, usually 5-10% gain, scalp or swing trade. It’s been working very well for me last couple months

This strategy should pull an average of about $300 per week and as long as the semis continue to see demand, the underlying will rise as well.Yes, it's a 3x leveraged ETF, I know, but that volatility will eventually pay me back as I rotate through the week...

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:02:39'] I Bought 10 of those this afternoon for .56 each.  Hit the lotto!  Congrats!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 15:55:58'] IV will probably collapse now that earnings are over.   Theta will take a bite.   You're looking at a relatively deep ITM put with minimal time to expiry and collapsed IV.  Your option should be worth just a little over $10 at open if FB opens at $250.Congrats on the big win!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:03:23'] I bought (1) $322.50 call and (1) $325.00 put. Total cost $2570.00. Now worth about $7500.00. Not bad for 30 minutes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 17:59:36'] Your $105 investment should be worth about $4700 if the stock opens at $250. https://i.imgur.com/uw4eleS.jpg
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:00:37'] What I typically do is take the strike price and subtract the hypothetical stock price from it, in the case of a put option. With such little DTE I just calculate intrinsic value so in your case it’ll be worth AT LEAST $10.00 if FB opens at $250. Add a little more for extrinsic value but expect $10.00 at a minimum

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:46:59'] Why is everyone buying puts? I thought I should buy calls because the stock will probably bounce back from 23% loss right?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:03:46'] Nice, I rarely buy puts but I just had a good feeling about getting them for fb. I went in with 2x $295, 7x $270 and 5x $220 these expire 2/11. Going to be a nice day for us tomorrow, hopefully
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 17:23:33'] I bought a 350 CALL. I don’t have to struggle to come up with what premium it’ll be. I like dice 🎲 games.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:00:01'] Forgot to mention, I also have 1 $317.50p expiring Friday, but that one will for sure just trade at IV tomorrow. Hoping $250 holds so I can turn about $10k off these.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 17:16:13'] Here’s the [Options Profit Calculator ](http://opcalc.com/Hib) table for the 3 contracts. The prices next to the strike price are your total ESTIMATED profits for your contracts based on you costs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 17:29:02'] Assuming it opens at $250 (for easy math). At least $10, probably $15 at most?You would have intrinsic value of $10. While IV usually collapses after earnings, the considerable move *probably* means higher IV since this is well outside of the expected range of the move (The 02/05 322.5 Straddle was priced at 24.45 at close), so you're probably looking at some more $ due to the volatility.If it was me Id' probably take the W and close out immediately tomorrow. Of course it's possible FB keeps dumping and is the catalyst for the next leg down in whatever the market is doing overall... but it's also possible it rebounds to 280 or something. Your lotto tickets hit, but if you hold you run the risk of having that $$ destroyed by all the fun that comes with 0-1dte.Edit: opening share price of 245 lead to ~19, 15 of which would be intrinsic. Feeling pretty spot on about the pricing the other factors
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 18:02:23'] I would just wait till the am. I had 4 AMD calls I expected to be around 700 each this am and it dropped within mins of opening and I barely made 400 by the time I could hit sell. You will know what you made when you hit sell and the transaction is complete.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 18:16:38'] 3 to 4 million me thinks
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 20:14:27'] Congratulations. I wouldn’t get greedy because it could easily be pulled up by a gap fill in the morning.I would probably sell two of them at the open for whatever intrinsic value has.Then I personally would hold the third one until $225 or Friday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 03:26:40'] A lucky trade, given how far out of the money it was.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 08:41:38'] Congrats op! How did you know it would tank? Your puts are $17.45 each rn. Lucky. $105 is now $5235

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 16:38:24'] I was so close to buying 5 contracts of 2/18 275 puts for around 1k… bought gme calls instead because I’m an ape at heart Now I’m kicking myself
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 17:30:06'] Wouldn’t such a huge drop increase IV even though earnings are over?  Personally I’d close out one or two and see where is settles.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 18:43:59'] Link: [https://optionstrat.com/build/long-put/FB/220204P260](https://optionstrat.com/build/long-put/FB/220204P260)If FB opens at exactly $250 tomorrow, your options "should" be worth $16.37 each right at opening. The theta decay is so great though, that by expiration on Friday, an FB price of $250 would only price your options at $10 so I would advise taking the win as quickly as you can, don't be greedy.By the way, I seriously thought about this exact trade today, thinking FB would surprise the market and tank, but didn't pull the trigger, sucks but they'll be more trades in the future. Great job!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 19:53:56'] so what compelled you to buy a 260 put expiring in 2 days?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 19:54:52'] Option price = intrinsic value + extrinsic value.You can easily calculate intrinsic value.  It's stock price minus strike price, or in this case 260-250 = 10.Extrinsic value is more difficult to calculate, but it will probably be on the order of 2-4 dollars.So I reckon you can sell your puts back for anywhere between 12-14 dollars if FB opens at 250
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 15:57:20'] NICE. It's really just supply and demand. Profit is profit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 19:00:25'] Considering how much it dropped I’m not expecting a huge drop in IV honestly, it’s gonna be volatile near term. I’d say you will have a _solid_ $200 in time value on top of the inteinsic value. Imo $1200 each if it opens at $250

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 05:47:53'] CallsJust about to get started into options, my primary strategy to begin with being a Straddle/strangle. Now the Put side I can understand the profit on exercise, call options are a bit blurry for me.

Is there a way you can realize the profits instantly as opposed to buying and then selling the underlying via the call?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 13:22:04'] Trying to hedge my portfolio, but I ain't no financial advisor... wondering what the best way to approach this is.I have a mixture of stocks/ETFs across all sectors and also across countries (US, EU, CN). Don't necessarily need to hedge everything perfectly, but I do want to reduce risk a bit after today's rally and looking for something simple. Should I just buy put options on broad indices at a small % of my portfolio? Buy leveraged inverse ETFs? Short index futures?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 16:58:55'] I've been trading options for a while and learning my limits to better refine my strategy.So now I thought about using this strategy, a more conservative approach to long calls:1. Always set a limit order for 50% profit. If I feel like selling before that's ok. The rationale here is because all the time I pick my contracts, I saw it going really well, some over 200%, but I got greedy and I couldn't take any of these profits.2. Only buy calls to companies I see growth for over the past 10 years. My favorite picks right now are SPY (mainly), MSFT, and APPL.

For example I sell a Jan 2024 40P for which gives the buyer the right to sell me 100 stocks for 40$ each(with current price being 100$) and I collect 1200$ premium.That means I can't invest the 4000$ somewhere else, but I still get a 30% increase over 2 years or 14% and if the price does drop by 60% I still collected the premium and got to buy the shares at a cheap price.I feel like I'm missing something?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 10:44:02'] A lot of times in this sub I read that options shine at income generation as opposed to total return. The rationale seems intuitive to me - cash now is always better than cash later.To investigate this, I created a net present value model of a steady income strategy vs. buy-and-hold S&P 500, only selling after a year. Here are the basic assumptions:* **Risk free rate**: 1.8% (10 yr TSY) * **Options income strategy**:   * Trading Cost: 1% trading cost each month  * Taxes: 24% (short-term cap gains tax rate).* **Buy-and-hold S&P 500**:   * Trading Cost: $1 to buy/sell an ETF.  * Taxes: 15% (long-term cap gains tax rate)  * CAGR: 15.75% (CAGR over the last 10 years)Even after discounting cash flows further out in the future, I'd have to return **18% per annum (225 bps of alpha)** via options for it to be worth it due to trading costs and paying short-term cap gains.Are my assumptions correct here? If it is, that is an incredibly high bar for any viable options strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:24:31'] How do you decide when to exit a call spread?my short term goal was to get a better understanding of call options and hopefully turn a small profit.  I have a spread open where my short strike price is $5 more than my long strike price. It cost me $121 to get into this position. I've got 46 days until expiration.1. If both calls are ITM and my shares get called, I can exercise my long call for $5 per share less. profit = $500 - $121 ... $379 and finish with the same number of shares I started with.2. If both calls are OTM, I lose my $121 buy in.3. If price is between strikes, I can be between $121 loss and $379 gain.&#x200B;I had an opportunity earlier today to close out the position, recoup the $121 premium and profit an extra $50. I am bullish on the underlying stock and believe strike price will be above both prices near expiration as it will be a few weeks after earnings report and there have been recent positive events.  My long term intention is to sell 6-month to 1-year calls at strike prices well above my cost basis and invest the premiums into SPY.   Based on that, would you bail on your position as soon as it is profitable, wait until you are closer to the expiration date, or white knuckle it until expiration day?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 21:37:54'] Hey everyone!    Quick question: I was thinking about doing a few PMCC's on a few solid companies (HD, Apple, Nvidia, SPY, etc.), and I have been reading around how some people pick strikes that have an 80 delta or higher.    However, out of curiosity, I went onto TOS, and using SPY, I found historically, on a 2 year LEAP, doing an ATM LEAP vs. .80 Delta LEAP yielded better returns. However, the delta on that was usually around a .6, meaning there's much more risk and it's slightly better than a coin toss.    So am I better off doing a .80 Delta LEAP strike for risk rather than ATM for better historical returns?    To give you an idea, on SPY for 2 years, I got the following results.    https://i.imgur.com/5dvaKIg.png    https://i.imgur.com/a1h1xqB.png    https://i.imgur.com/uwOnmpA.png        You can see in each of them, the ATM call was the better historical return by FAR. Is that because SPY "usually" goes up, while other individual stocks may have more risk with all things being equal?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 09:16:05'] TL;DR: How would YOU defend a position if a 'black swan' event caused a major drop in value?I've reverted to paper trading as my theta strategies all got blown up last month, so I reset my account and am trying to learn before I jump back in. So, for this example, I really would like to know "what you would do" in this situation. Rest assured, no insight can/will be taken as financial advise as it's all theoretical.\- Last month in my PT account, I bought a 1/20/23@170 PYPL call for $41.10 (current cost basis is 24.94) with the goal of running diagonal calendar spreads, lowering my cost basis, and eventually getting assigned by selling an ITM when such a move was appropriate (again, this is for educational purposes. I realize that normally I'd just want to sell the contract).\- Current value is $9.75 on an apparently massive ER miss (guidance was pessimistic). I went over some 3rd party analysis and while I feel that the concerns are overblown, the fact of the matter is I'm down 80% so for the experiment I am proceeding as if my original thesis IS wrong.\- With this much time left, I feel that the best option is NOT to cut my losses as I'm throwing away roughly 90% of the theta I paid for. That being said, what would be the best move to make at this point? Another diagonal calendar spread at this range is obviously picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, but if I keep lowering my cost basis I could perhaps reach B/E sooner and sell the contract/exit the position (again, I consider the play a failure as market sentiment has proven that my thesis was incorrect) on some positive price action. Also, I do have a good amount of time to roll out, but my runway is finite so the fear is pinning myself into an assignment at a loss.\- My first thought was just doing [the repair strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/repair-strategy.asp), but given the market reaction, this could easily just be throwing money at bad money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 11:48:29'] Is doing vertical spreads a more appropriate strategy than buying naked options in periods of higher IV (ex: before earnings)? It looks to me that the price of spreads actually stays the same no matter how high IV's are because both the sold and bought option will have similar IV's. Would that be true? If it is, then similarly would selling naked options be more appropriate than doing debit spreads in periods of high IV's? I know it's unlimited loss potential and a bad idea in general, but would it be more profitable than vertical spreads in that case?

The only thing is none of  the videos really properly explain is what do you do if the stock is tanking downwards??

Here are the trades:  1 - Bought 2 SOFI 12.5 PUT @ 0.61 LIMIT  12.5 is strike price. 0.61 is limit price. Fill price stated in questrade is 0.57 and fees is 11.95  2 - Sold 2 SOFI 12.5 PUT @ Market  Fill price is 1.14. Fees is 11.95 I do not understand how I made 114 USD profit. This is my calculation: Profit = (114 \* 2 - 11.95) - (57 \* 2 + 11.95) = 90.1

I sell a CSP on stock A for 100 shares at a strike price of $10.Stock A is assigned to me at $10 I sell a CC on stock A for $11My CC is exercised at $11 So my tax implications would be $1100-$1000=$100 taxable correct?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 07:14:15'] I've ended up in a position with XELA, where my cost basis in all shares is under the lowest strike price available for the options. I'm expecting some upward movement in due to corporate action, that will cause it to IMO hover around that strike ($1) in the coming weeks. If I sell my shares outright I will get an expected $1 per share minus the cost basis of \~.75 per share (.25 per share). But if I sell covered calls against my shares, for expiry after the corporate event that is triggering this movement, I get a premium of $20 per contract and likely get assigned (which I am alright with). My return then is then .25 per share, plus $20 for each contract owned. Seems like I am missing something, but I am almost intending to be assigned at this point which is a new idea for me. Thoughts?

My general rule is I pull money off the table at +40%, but that's often for thetagang strategies. I'm a generally conservative trader, so I'm going to close out prior to earnings this evening, but I was wondering what the general consensus is around strangle management around earnings.

The trade when I opened it, and  2. now (out of hours)[https://imgur.com/a/TNuTcVa](https://imgur.com/a/TNuTcVa)***My question is this : why has the cost to close it dropped so significantly?*** Last night after opening it was $418 (net liq) debit to close it (see top img). This morning it is $84 (net liq) to close it (see bottom img).I opened the trade with the euro around 1.40 and as you can see it has gone up to 1.44 since, but the debit to close has dropped significantly.The only explanation I have is the IV. Which I think was around 6% on the Mar 4th contract last night, but is currently 11%, but I am still surprised by just how big the difference is. The only other explanation I can think of, is that the out-of-hours bid-ask spread is so huge right now, that it is not really *that* cheap to get out of this trade (I am trying to, but its not getting any love).(back story to this IC entry: I had a Call Credit Spread (bearish the Euro). The ECB meeting caused price to shoot up, and so I turned it into an Iron Condor in the hope of getting out for B/E later, thus allowing me to roll the CCS up for no additional cost).any other reasons why this might be looking so different out of hours?***EDIT:*** ***in the last hour it has changed and I am seeing $518 debit to close it now, which is more like what I was expecting. I guess it was the bid-ask spread and lack of liquidity causing it, but confused the hell out me. Back to damage control, like I thought!***

I can still make money, even if the call is OTM (400 < 500), because bid/ask has been improved drastically due to the rising stock price. I can basically sell to close. This is what I saw on a trading simulation.However, I learned this differently at school. Payoff is (stock - strike) x 100 per contract, if the option is ITM. OTM call is worthless.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 09:32:52'] Hey guys new here. I was curious about the chemistry of an options trade I am in. Looking for some insight. I just did a straddle bought a 4660call for 49.25 and a 4660put for 50.50. The market price of the /ES is now 4474. The delta is 55.06 for the call and -44.96 for the put. I would expect the price of each to be fairly close to offsetting each other or slightly higher for the call and showing a slight profit as the delta moves greater. Yet the call is only at a value of 55 and the put is at 38. I only purchased this within the hour. Why is there such a large difference in price? Why didn't the call appreciate in value as fast as the put fell in value? It couldn't have been theta burn and the gamma and vega are equal to each other. What do you guys think?

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-26 20:32:52'] In theory, about one third of strangles will win. The hope is enough big winners to overcome all the losers.In practice, I observe cycles. A few big blowouts and premiums go up. Then a few small movers and premiums go down. All in all playing earnings is a crap shoot. As to why 2/3 are losers, that covers one standard deviation. In theory, the market tries to guess how big the move will be. Most large sets of data come very close to the predicted outcome.

You should really understand why before doing any option trade.  Earnings especially.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 08:27:22'] AMZN has been a great trade for me weekly for the last 6 weeks.  I would think it may behave a little like NFLX, which dropped briefly in after hours and recovered.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 15:06:45'] Is there a reason why you believe earnings will be better than estimates expect? Big pops on earnings are generally more a result of substantial beats, not the actual numbers since the market haa priced in these estimates. Also, implied volatility is higher going into earnings making options more expensive. This earnings premium will be lost afterwards.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 09:30:27'] While I can't comment on Amazon, Microsoft was an obvious play, but it's probably too late. I bought May 17 calls when MSFT was trading at around $120 and, over a span of one week, they've yielded an unrealized return of 50% on the back of analyst recommendations and excitement over earnings (we're now at $123.40).I'm surprised by the absence of people simply riding calls up to, and until, a company's earnings. Quality names receive a large amount of anticipatory bids compounded by buy ratings or reiterated buy ratings at higher price targets. This is clustered right before reports are published. I'm doing the same with Facebook.For MSFT, I'll sell my calls before they release their numbers -- MSFT usually trades sideways following earnings and IV evaporates. I did this with IBM too, buying calls about a week before they reported and selling beforehand. In the case of Facebook, I might ride through earnings as it's not a massive position and so far my contracts have done nothing (more bad press). Hopefully FB receives a torrent of buy/overweight ratings and upward revisions to price targets next week.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 10:37:06'] Was in AMZN $1900s for this Friday. It was due for a pop but it didn't get the pop I needed. It's still trending, looks to have upside, will probably get in again after my new AAPL plan or LULU/HD/MTCH/ pay, or DIS pays again.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 11:03:57'] I'll be selling AMZN puts ahead of earnings.  But I won't mind owning some if it moves against me.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 12:21:48'] Options get very expensive the week of earnings until the day earnings are officially released
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 08:22:08'] I think amzn is likely to get pinned to kill the ridiculously high premiums
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 19:32:50'] I currently have 3 June 2020 1500 strikes on amazon. I tend not to do the short term stuff and typically buy fairly deep into the money.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-24 15:00:32'] Facebook trading above $198 after earnings!  BOOM!
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-20 08:27:18'] Certainly trade both - I plan on a long strategy for AMZN, selling OTM puts using the wheel strategy. FB, on the other hand, looks to be a good short opportunity. Based on FB’s business model and its ongoing privacy concerns, losing users, and Zuck’s call to regulated his own company, I don’t see a long term viable company. Hopefully there will be someone on the other side of these trades for me to exploit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 10:07:26'] All I can tell you is I have made a killing on Amazon calls with the same formula. When Amazon is getting crushed going in buy relatively close to the money or at the money calls that go out with plenty of time value. Even if the stock goes down 500 points on a stock like Amazon the time value will help save you from getting totally crushed and if the stock takes off the time value will decrease once they start getting further into the money.  If you find yourself in that situation you also have a very good problem to have.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-14 18:26:23'] This is not a good idea at all. You can certainly buy short term ITM options on amazon and go for the ride. No need to have $220,000 for 100 shares. Don’t forget amazon was at 1400 a few times last year. FYI, Nvda tsla aapl Goog nflx all provide great short term ITM plays. I’m up around 700% in the past 5 months with my strategies.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-14 13:49:59'] What is the single biggest risk of running the wheel on a stock? The stock price going down substantially.Even if you could afford 100 shares of Amazon, would you be able to manage that risk? Most likely not. Not many people can afford $228,700 in a single stock and still be properly diversified.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-14 13:53:17'] It can be done, but typically this strategy isn't the best on high flying tech stocks. You are very likely to get whipsawed.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-14 17:08:09'] I do this time to time on AMZN, but not the wheel part.  If the AMZN options are going to be ITM, I'll just buy back the short option.  It's ok, but AMZN has a lower IV actually and a relatively higher realized vol to that IV, so not the best name imo (look at last two days! - yes I know it went up, but imagine those same moves down, you would be scewed).  It also costs me about \~35k of cash secured margin (so no multiplier attached to the margin) to sell 1 slightly OTM AMZN option, so it's really really costly on your margin. You have to set aside 35k in capital just to be able to sell 1 of these.MSFT might actually be better AND it's a lower dollar stock so you can take on the shares and it costs way less in margin.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 18:08:41'] if it's *moved quickly* in your favor on a leap, that's when i'd sell it. iv's spiked. that's going to be your best price unless something crazy happens to make it spike more. i've watched leaps come back to earth. doesn't feel great. 😂
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 18:13:52'] Put your option into [optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://optionsprofitcalculator.com) and it will give you what it would be worth throughout its life. Above the results it has a little thing for raising or lowering IV.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 18:21:22'] The direction and how long it lasts will play a bigger role for your position considering how far dated it is.  This does little to answer your question but consider that the spread between bid and ask for your strike would be quite wide.  Delta would be the biggest contributor to the price of your option until it gets closer to expiration.  Your option will have intrinsic value once it goes ITM.  Until then, it is mostly extrinsic value.  Granted the price of the option will be greater the closer it gets ITM.  That may give you an opportunity to close at a profit if you choose.As far as managing your position to profit, that must be something to be considered pretty early in the process.  Saying "sell the option soon within 3-4 months seeing how quickly amazon is moving up" once you already have the position is a great thesis but how will your management change if that doesn't happen?  I personally close my options at either a profit or loss of 50%.  That's just how I've been doing it for a long time.  It gives enough time for the option to either work or fail.  Manage mechanically.  Winning processes must be repeatable over a long span of time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 17:40:42'] Following, also curious about this.  I'm new to options as well, and buying LEAPS feels like the safest play to make.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 18:07:07'] First before you start putting money you should understand how options work.  Only you can decide when the right time to sell is.If the stock goes to 250-300 by expiration it would be ITM and worth more than it is right now.  The only way it would be worthless is if it is under 200 by expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 19:25:47'] Hey dude i commented on your other post.Hope you get some help.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:48:01'] OK.  You bought an OTM call option.  All of the value of it, the premium, is extrinsic value.  So 100% of it will decay over the life of the option.  Even though the option increased in value...it is still OTM so 100% of it is still EV.  When you bought it at 2.85, 100% of that is EV.  Now that its worth 6.00, 100% of that is EV.  So it will still decay.It will decay non-linearly over the life of the option.Note that if AMZN goes to 195, and the option is worth 80 or something...that 80 will still be 100% EV.  Only when the spot price > strike price (e.g. over 200) will a part of the premium be intrinsic value vs extrinsic value.What are you doing to do with the option?  It went up 2.5x.  That's good.  You going to hold onto it?  I would.  I would pick a stock price in your head that AMZN needs to each by a certain time...and if it hits that would sell.  Maybe pick 3300 or 3500.  That seems to be ATH.  (oops..I meant pre-split.  Post split it would be 165-175 range.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 22:56:18'] BTW...I wouldn't worry too much about IV on this.  IV will go up and down over the next 2 years.  And usually it will go down as the stock goes up.  So it will be working against you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 00:26:11'] if u wanna know value at expiry just do underlying minus strike. if its gonna be $300 then ur $200 strike will be $100
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 00:08:04'] Same thought. Thats why i bought TQQQ options with Jan 24 expiry. If Nasdaq up 10% from now, i will be ITM Based on my calculation the chances of profit is high, considering current Nasdaq still at low-mid level.What are the risk i should be alert of?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 03:15:51'] Risking sounding flippant, but think about why you bought it?What did you expect the underlying to do in terms of price &/or volatility?Has it done so?  If you have achieved what you wanted to, pocket the profit.If it hasn't, what is your view now?  And is there a better way to profit from it?If you didn't/ don't have a view, it's a gamble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 18:04:42'] If you havent already sold, you could find a further OTM call and sell the further OTM call for $2.85 and net yourself a free debit spread for the potential to make the difference between the two strikes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 03:39:48'] Depends what you mean by “naked options”. Selling a call w/out the shares is just stupid, buying a call w/out the intention of buying the shares and just seeking to flip it…that’s fine and what most option traders do. Alternatively you could buy a low cost stock with a good options chain and just collect premium off that for a while
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 05:54:45'] No, not decent money, but you would have to start somewhere, and your broker will likely not allow you to do naked anything with that capital anyway (which is a bad idea regardless if you're new). Practice paper-trading first. Since you have TastyWorks then you're probably familiar with options and different strategies already. Focus on an industry you're very familiar with, and don't dump it all on one trade. You can be right on the data, and still be wrong on the trade for a large amount of factors that are out of your control. &#x200B;If it were me personally starting out in options, I would divide that $1,000 into 3-4 smaller trades with the expectation that I'm going to lose it all for the sake of learning, or you could just paper-trade...but you're not going to learn as much as you would with skin in the game.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 11:48:33'] Thank you for the unusually sophisticated analysis on dispersion trading.Do you ever buy the components when you short dispersion? It's extremely expensive and operationally intensive, but it gives you the true arb on the implied corr.The other benefit of buying components is you can hold to expiration. If you just short the index vol, you're relying on the market correcting this abnormally high corr. But if the market never corrects, then the only way to recognize your vision is to realize the implied vols.Lastly, do you have a screener to track all implied corr? If yes, could you do a correlation relative value trade? where you buy low correlation percentile indices and sell high correlation?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 11:37:35'] Great write up! Couple of clarifying Qs:1) Your friends who decreased PnL through delta hedging: was this mostly down to transaction costs or was the realized volatility in the period they held the trade high enough to eat into PnL?  2) "With this trade structure, I was leaning slightly positive delta. I had **very little theta** or gamma, and a LOT of vega. Basically, as long as the stock didn't trend to hard in one direction, I had a pretty linear trade."I think I answered my own question after writing this :) You would have benefitted from theta but I'm guessing in relation to your vega, it was relatively small.3) Did you consider some form of calendar spread (i.e. perhaps the dislocation of 1y IV meant that eg 60d IV was underpriced on a relative basis)? I'm assuming there was no need to overcomplicate a good trade - as you say, keep it simple.Congrats!

How would you go about this if you wanted a limited risk strategy? Asking because a news based event can get out of hand and move the underlying significantly. How do you manage that?2. Since you mentioned ATM of the underlying during your entry was $50, why did you go for the $58 strangle? Why not an ATM strangle? Thank you!! And please do keep these coming

	COMMENT: ['2018-04-27 11:32:11'] I'm bearish on this and am obviously down for the day, but I'm not exiting. Amazon failed to break the high range it's been consolidating in for the last several months. Their valuation is also still very very stretched up here and not all metrics we're that impressive. Net Income was obviously a huge beat, but OCF and Revenue were pretty meh and their 2-3% operating margin doesn't leave much room for either to start seeing decline.I'd take profits, but I'm down like 10% this year, so take that with a grain of salt.
	COMMENT: ['2018-04-27 11:59:45'] Take your money and run, very successful trade. Don’t be greedy for another 10%. I imagine potential downside being much higher than any potential upside. Dump the calls and pop a bottle of champagne, you did well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 21:57:51'] Take a break if you start to get emotional with trading. Occasionally, for a few weeks, and occasionally, for a few months. It is quite helpful. Trading isn't worth the anguish and frustration... If you're not in the appropriate frame of mind, you'll keep making poor choices out of desperation until your account is entirely blown.     Tell you what, you can try using a trading bot assuming you have a lot of experience this time around. For this, I recommend [Breaking Equity](https://www.breakingequity.com/?r=1). They help you stay in control of your emotions during the trading process, making it simpler to stick to your strategy and maintain your discipline.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 23:06:14'] I think taking some time off trading would be a good start.    Also when you come back, go over what you did wrong.  Write it down so that you don’t repeat it. Additionally if you’re doing straight up calls, start thinking about LEAPS and PMCC (Poor Man’s covered calls).   If the stock takes off buy back the short position and ride the wave.  Additionally when you get back on, go for base hits and not home runs.   Look at trends.   (Monthly trends, seasonal trends,  triple witching, earnings , controversy, new product announcements or basically “ why am I in this option or stock position).  Hope you get back on the saddle.

For those of us who’ve been doing this awhile, we’ve all been there.  Just get ahold of yourself and calm down.  If you don’t have a retirement IRA or 401k? Get one.  That’s for the long term.  If you have money left over to invest, put 80% into long term etf’s or diversified portfolio.  The other 20% is for the more risky stuff- options, margin trading, or the pump and dumps.

What a huge mistake, because about 24 hours later, the damn thing not only recovered completely, but went up by 40% to 60%.Instead of losing $1,500 cuz of damn emotions, I would have gained like $2,000 and celebrated with those same stupid ass emotions.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 22:34:01'] I’m a ticker watcher, especially if I don’t have anything else to do or work is slow, so I don’t have tips for that. But I have a couple others that help me. Use a different app than your broker app to check the market. This way if something is down big, you can’t just start trading because you aren’t in the broker app - it’ll gives you a moment to think before you react and check the news too. This helps me decide if the reason I bought is still intact or not and then I decide accordingly.The second thing I do is set a price target for the position and add a notification on my tracker app, once again, not my broker. As I mentioned it helps me from opening my broker and trading. If my PT gets hit I re-evaluate and then decide if I feel like riding it out some more and set a new price target and keep holding or selling. I mostly sell because I’m conservative on my short term trades as I just use it to help grow my long stock at this point in life. I do this for anything 3+ months options and short term shares. I just do earnings checkups on my long holds. Using a separate app in general has me in the habit of opening the tracker app instead of my broker, so way less trading and more watching for opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 23:56:04'] Congrats to you for realizing this. In terms of advice: 1. there is the concept of intrinsic value. Trying to understand what a company is really worth and understanding that in 99% of cases that is above or below the current price. That has not so much to do with options, but is at the core of value investing. For me, the price movements doesn’t make me very emotional, as I am more focused on intrinsic value. 2. Think in bets and not outcome. Maybe your decision to sell Tesla was the right decision. You never know about the future, you can just make a decision based on known facts. You have two aces on your hand and go all in: maybe not the wrong decision. You have nothing and go all in but somehow still win unexpectedly: well, good outcome for you but it was not a good play. So think in bets. Learn from poker and understand that outcome and good decisions are not always the same.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 01:49:40'] Well emotional trading works in a way - just do the opposite and you'll make money or at least break even. I also had the same stock and went through the same dip. Instead of panic sell, i just let go and treated as if it doesnt exist and just left it untouched and moved onto other stocks as i knew the company would spring back sometime later. Took longer than expected but did work out. As for emotional trading, i do believe it helps abit as most ppl think thee similar - if you have strong urge to buy, hold or sell as so many others would do the same. BUT always do some DD before investing unless you are just tossing fee cents here and there just to have some fun like playing slots.

There’s no shortcut to this lesson, and it’s the single most important and PRODUCTIVE lesson you can learn- congratulations! You’ve experienced what it’s like to trade your feelings  and you will be that much more equipped to be able to ignore them when you open your next positions. As you state, having defined exit plans, or any plans at all, is a huge step toward ensuring that happens. Stock prices never do what you “want” them to do, but will frequently do what you “think” they’ll do. My advice is 1), regularly reassess if your opinion about what the price will do has changed. If so, adjust accordingly. If not, do nothing (always an overlooked option), and if you’re not sure, do nothing until you are. Dont let your feelings tell you that you must always do something. 2) Keep track of how often you’re right and wrong so you can make sure the gains you take are large enough to offset the losses. You should be able to know what those ratios are, so if you don’t, start keeping track. Don’t stop trading! You’ve just learned what will help you make big gains in the years to come!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 02:47:16'] My two cents and where I believe your mistake was, is that you didn plan a strategy before entering the trade. Planning is fundamental to success. If you plan your trading from start to finish you are prepared for negative outcomes also. It is not a sudden event and gives you experience also to make better trades in the future. Don't focus of how the trade evolved but focus on entry and exit planning according to your risk tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 02:53:24'] The best changes I've made to my strategy after destroying my portfolio are as follows:  **1) There is no such thing as a missed opportunity.**  Yes, black swan events are rare.    However, there are so many cases of stocks going up or down by 100s of % in a day or 1000s in a year.  Chasing a stock is a fool's game and very VERY rarely pays off.  Don't try to force an entry or exit point onto a stock you're (emotionally) invested in.  If you have a strategy (swing trading etc) then look for opportunities that fit your criteria and don't try to convince yourself that there's an opportunity there otherwise.**2) There are only three things that matter when assessing stocks** ***(and they all affect each other.)***  Technical Analysis attempts to measure sentiment, what the market believes is fair value based on buying and selling pressures at different levels of valuation.  TA typically remains correct until something changes.Fundamental Analysis looks at actual data, news, numbers.  If TA is the driver then FA is the cop with a speed camera who will chase you down if you're out of line.  Sometimes TA runs away from FA but that's never done without the help of the last one.Sentiment Analysis, which takes things like social media posts and attempts to gauge the wider public opinion about a stock.  This one is fickle, full of liars and trolls.  However, it can be helpful to guide your analysis towards FA or TA if you're unsure.  **3) Leave your ego at the door.**This one might be the most relevant for you.  If you have too much ego/confidence you won't second-guess your DD when it's wrong.  If you have too little confidence you won't stop doubting your DD when it's correct.Be Confident about your DD but avoid confirmation bias, avoid FOMO, avoid unfounded FUD.Be Objective.  Take the information into consideration in a dispassionate way and use your chosen analyses to figure out if it's helpful to your end goal.Finally, sometimes results will have nothing to do with your DD.  A company gets bought up at a good price and you pat yourself on the back, even though it was nothing but luck.  That's your ego convincing you that you somehow earned those gains. You didn't really.Sometimes you had everything right and some news comes out that tanks the stock.  It sucks, but that's not on you.&#x200B;Hope this helps.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 03:46:21'] First decide if it's your system or emotions that caused the problem.  Often the two are confused because we select or create trading systems based on our emotions... how much we want risk on a trade, how we evaluate risk, how we manage our capital, how we determine if a   a particular system is appropriate for a particular market. Emotions can enter the creation of a system that will fail even if no emotions is involved in executing the system.  Review your notes - you have them, right? - to see why you entered and why you exited.  Take a break. Don't resume trading until you clearly and unemotionally understand what happened.

You've already identified your issue, so commit to a plan.  Write it down.  Consult it before checking your holdings and rehearse it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 04:29:18'] I use to be an emotional trader before and the way i learnt was to literally force myself away from my screen and think logically. Is it better to sell now? Is a catalyst coming up? Why did i buy the stock in the first place? If i hold for 1 more month, is the price likely to go back up? All these questions i ask myself first away from my screen and think, it takes 1 second to close the app and just walk away for a bit. IF im gonna sell right now, what difference would it make if i sell in 10 minutes from now? Thats what i keep in my head and then it keeps me thinking logically
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 04:29:44'] Trading is 40% strategy and size at most. The rest of it is psychological. Psychology by far is the biggest hurdle most traders have to overcome, and unfortunately, because it's human behavior, there is no set guideline to follow.You're honest enough to admit that you didn't plan ahead and didn't have an exit strategy. That's where you should start: have a plan going into every trade with a strategy to get out in case the trade both goes and doesn't go your way. Educate yourself on when to enter and when to exit if you haven't done that already.Other than that, spend time in the market. I was an emotional trader too for months, but time in the market and continuing to study charts helped tone down the emotions more. It's still a work in progress, but I'm processing information much more logically now than two or three months ago. While you're doing this, trade with small size; the second you feel the need to go big, stop and walk away.Always remember the old cliche: unsuccessful traders chase gains, successful traders manage risk.

Sure it could have been a bagger or even two (bagger meaning by 100% profits) but the point should be that you have to have your own strategy. Also if you think it's too much dont play option like tsla or shop start one with small cap like pltr fubo and etc.This will help to set your principle and when you feel confident on your principle you can manage it betterAt the end of days even if you lose fubo's earning yolo option play it's just meager 100$, but just imagine for amzn tsla mrna or shop.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 08:26:59'] I think being hit helps. You know it hurts and so afraid to do it next time. I just decreased my leverage, reviewed my strategies and now I sleep like a baby.Also, you know now, that waiting can help. Don't trade after sharp moves. There often will be at least some rebound. Sometimes a good company makes a dumb move and is screwed till next earnings. It is a waiting game, among other. The market is counterintuitive thing. I do the opposite of what my gut tells me to buy low and sell high.Also, maybe you just need to read some literature? Learn about [Kelly Criterion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/mn0ykx/kellys_criterion_for_gamblers/). It describes, how you are likely to lose, even when the chances are for you, just because of sizing. Don't be overleveraged, it is bad for your mental health and money. It is very important. Learn about the damn risk management! I size my bets, so my max loss on each is not that big. I have some naked puts against margin, but I'll easily stomach even a circuit breakers day.I think you should put it all aside to calm down and go read some books on this.And the literature says, that you probably won't beat the market, see the arguments for the efficient market hypothesis. I actually treat trading like fun and not money making. And what I do is often just a kind of leverage, I'm fine to have a bit and it is successful in the backtests.Stop loss is not a tool for me. Bad for options, cause volatility and not traded outside hours. Bad, cause not the best price. Bad, cause you cannot wait a bit after a spike. My stop losses would be at like -40% of the stock value, so I just don't bother. Maybe they are very useful for day traders or something.Or maybe you just screw it and go become a [boglehead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/)? It is not a bad decision, not at all. Just as I won't ever recommend trading, I always recommend passive investing.

But now I’m like, “Well I could see this happening all the time when I tested this thing and it kept telling me to ignore the static, so I will.”It’s quite liberating watching prices plummet and feeling like, “Well ok that’s just the cycle these things go through, no need to panic.” Then sure enough, days or weeks later it’s right back where the program told me it’d be and I didn’t panic sell.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive got a 7/17 $2985 buy/$2990 sell call Ive been trying to close since yesterday. Obviously one side is extremely down. Im wondering what is going to be the best way to get it closed or since the one leg is in the money should I just let the sell call expire worthless and then let the buy call expire in the money? Also since amazon is a larger company whats the better way to trade this option? Should I have done the spread differently? I dont have 8k to straight buy the option so Im just curious if theres a better way to trade the spread. Thanks'

POST_TEXT: b'Amazons prime day is coming up and so is its ER day. With the hopes of stimulus and overall market looking bullish, I am hoping to make some gains out of Amazon. However, the problem is that I dont have the capital to buy any option for Amazon.\n\nRecently, Ive been studying a lot of options strategies and actually applying them to make small gains. I came across Risk Reversal strategy that is mainly used to protect an underlying position. Risk reversal in Amazons case would be -\n\nSelling an OTM put option and then Buying an OTM call option. This way you receive premium for selling the option and can use that money to buy the call option. \n\nDo you think its a good strategy? Or what am I missing?'
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 22:28:15'] If you don’t have enough capital to buy AMZN options, you definitely don’t have capital to sell AMZN options. Selling a put on AMZN will require **A lot** more capital than buying a call or a put. For context, selling a put will require around $300K to cash secure it. And $35k-$50k to sell it naked on reg-T margin account. If you want a bullish strategy on AMZN consider a bullish vertical spread (a put credit or a call debit spread).
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-05 22:23:58'] > what am I missing?You don’t have capital. So how are you going to secure the short put? You’re gonna use margin. Which comes with a million risks. That’s what you’re missing
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-06 06:38:19'] Buy an OTM call calendar spread.  Set the strikes at your price target.  Short expiration just after the events you mentioned.  Long expiration AT LEAST a couple of weeks after that - as much time as you can afford for this particular trade.  Ideally, this will give you slightly positive theta on a directionally bullish position.  More importantly, you should be able to afford this.If AMZN stays flat, you'll make a little from theta decay.  Up, you'll profit handsomely.  Down, you'll lose it all unless AMZN reverses back up before the long exp date.  Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 15:22:15'] >d) don't hold shorts through dividendsJust to be clear, dividend risk applies to short calls only.  It is not an issue with short puts.>c) if assigned on a short position, simply close the long position to cover.You may be oversimplifying here and may actually understand this, but it's more complex than that.  If you're assigned on a short option, you now have 1) a shares position in the underlying, and 2) a long option.  What you wrote implies all you have to do is sell the long option, but this isn't true.  If you were assigned on a short put, you need to sell the resultant long shares and sell the long put.  If you were assigned on a short call, you need to buy the resultant short shares and sell the long call.>1) What happens if there's a large, unexpected move in overnight trading and my short position(s) are assigned on market open ... BUT ... because I'm on Pacific Time (and like to sleep in), I don't become aware of that assignment until the market’s been open 5 hours, and price has rocketed back up or down to where it was before the big move? Admittedly most beginner options articles/videos don't go into this so it's a common misunderstanding.  Assignment isn't instantaneous.  Exercise requests received by brokerages throughout the day are sent to the OCC after hours, and assignments are then processed overnight.  If there's a large, unexpected move in after-hours/the premarket, let's say Monday night/Tuesday morning, and because of that, someone chooses to exercise on Tuesday morning, if you happen to get chosen for assignment it will be *Wednesday* morning when you find out about that.If in general the idea of not finding out about something until the market's been open 5 hours is intolerable to you, then unfortunately sleeping in while living in the Pacific Time Zone is not an option.  However, it shouldn't' be a big deal, because any price moves in the underlying will also be reflected in the price of your remaining long leg.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 16:32:34'] Prior to expiration, the maximum risk of a debit spread is the premium paid and for a credit spread, the difference in strikes less the premium received.I don't see any benefit to arbitrarily closing positions 4 days before expiration.  There are reasons for closing early but a fixed date is not one of them.You should not hold short equity positions across an ex-div date because you pay out the dividend but it's not a big deal for options since the dividend is priced in.Debit and credit spreads of the same series are synthetic, aka fungible.  In a fair priced market, they have the same risk profile.  For example, a Sep +50/-55c bull call is the same as a Sep -55/+50p spread. The main differences are B-A width and possible closing costs.Now, your questions:1. If asleep and assigned on the short leg, you will not lose anything more because you own the long leg.  The only issue would be if you don't have the BP to carry the equity position.  If your broker's policy is to close them out rather than allow you to meet the margin call, then you'd have more risk.  Also, you never want a broker closing out your positions because they won't work the order for the best possible fill.2. If you don't want to lose more than 30% of your account value ($30k), total up the maximum potential loss of all open positions and make sure that it's below $9k.3. Do not select positions based on share price.  Making money with spreads involves getting the direction right, or possibly, not wrong.  Diversify so that one position never eats you alive.  Trade as many different positions as you can handle  (on a fast day, if multiple positions are moving against, you don't want to be unable to deal with them all).  Also consider a combination of bullish and bearish so that hopefully, if it hits the fan (market movement not single stock bad news), you have some winners that don't need attention while you deal with the losers.I'd suggest that you start small.  Some of the answers will come from the experience of trading and you can't learn that from us or from any book. When you know the game, increase your size.Geez, I'm as bad as you are at writing short posts  :->)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-31 09:10:59'] > a) I know many say the Max Risk is the Premium Paid.Well, you don't know as much as you thought, since that is not correct.The **maximum loss at expiration** is the net debit on the spread at open, but that is not the same thing as max risk. You can, for example, lose more than the max loss if you close the spread before expiration. You can also gain more than max profit (spread width - opening debit).> b) close all positions prior to expiration - no later than 4 days before>> c) aim for around 75% of max profit which frees up capital for new trades (I see some advocating aiming for 50% - better perhaps)?You have 2 out of 3 of the necessary components for a basic exit strategy, but what about your loss limit? When do you bail out if the spread is losing money?> What happens if there's a large, unexpected move in overnight trading and my short position(s) are assigned on market openEssentially will never happen, given your strat and correctly stated understanding that assignment on shorts prior to expiration is exceedingly rare.Examine the time value on the short to have a measure of assignment risk. Risk increases as the amount of time value approaches zero. Since time value is always zero at expiration, that is why most assignments take place on expiration day.> Should I limit my trading of debit spreads to small stocks (say $15.00 - 35.00 range) No. One of the main advantages of vertical spreads is that you can trade the entire market for a reasonable price. Why knee-cap that advantage by limiting your potential market of underlyings to choose from?

However, the company's market cap is about ten billion dollars and they only have 2.5 million subscribers which means a company would have to pay 4 thousand dollars per sub at the current market value which is the only asset the company has at this point. I don't see them surviving another year without seriously diluting shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 00:59:38'] Just some fun math for those that think someone is going to buy crap company Peloton. Current Market Cap 9.72 Billion, 2.5 million subscribers. That's 3,888 dollars per subscriber. Website says subscription costs 40 bucks a month which is 480 dollars a year. That means that it would take 8.1 years for a company to get their money back. Yet people who are buying the stock think they are going to pay a premium for the company. The leaders of the company were smart to ditch their stocks. Baghold at your own peril.

And after several months this can be a better profitable position than the measly $400 in max profit.  You can even play this thru Earnings and take advantage of fat volatility bid/ask spreads during the build up in Earnings. Of course roll accordingly if a wings is tested. GL!

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-21 20:05:53'] I just put in 3 leg order for SPY, and I think you're right.  Luckily, I'm only risking $1,800 or so on this trade at 470c/480c/485c, and if it does hit $500 like you say (and I agree), I'll be pocketing around $2,700 in profit!Thanks for this awesome post!

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 08:59:34'] Go to Tasty (right side of this page). They usually sell OTM options. I think you might get more details on this pagehttps://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/iron-condorTheir deal is sell at 42dte , close around 21dte or roll. They want to collect at least 1/3 of distance of the strikes. I do not like IC so check the article. Also they have tons of vids on IC you could review.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 17:55:43'] Iron condor is a safe bet if you are new to options trading, in the long run they are not very capital efficient unless the IV drop significantly and HV remains relatively low during. Remember to Delta hedge once the greek becomes larger than your risk tolerance.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-30 16:18:57'] There is something called going inverted, no, not like Top Gun, well, maybe like Top Gun . . .Rolling the put side or just the short put up to be at a strike higher than the call.  If done properly it can reduce the loss but leave a small range the stock can move back through to make a little profit.  If done wrong it can lock in a loss.  Google inverted iron butterfly and some links come up that should help.There is more than a week left so it may make sense to let the stock settle in before making any move . . .
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-30 15:58:53'] I would immediately remove the call side tomorrow morning, since you have a full week, I don't think you will take the max loss.The only I can think of after removing the call side is to sell re sell a higher call spread. However, given the way Amazon moves, I would book your full loss and move on.

POST_TEXT: b' My thesis is that Amazon will hit $4000 by year-end. I am down \\~70% on my call positions listed above. I still believe my thesis, but I thought there would have been more momentum past July (stock has pretty much traded sideways since end of June).\n\nShould I roll these out (or at least the Sep 3550) for a substantial loss to Nov & Dec?'
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-17 10:32:22'] I am in a similar position with Tesla.  A month or two ago I bought Oct calls at what was at the time a Tesla high. Implied volatility quickly fell and i sunk into a substantial paper loss position. My advice to you is “do you still believe in your thesis’. What may have changed since your purchase that may have diluted your thesis? Amazon is facing some antitrust noise from Congress. They are facing some legal noise in Germany and (I think) other parts of Europe. Last week a California appeals court rules that Amazon is liable for third party sales. There is a lot of downward pressure at this moment on Amazon. On the other hand, it doesn’t appear that we are any closer to an end of the covid era. Lastly, Biden stretches his lead and with it, almost surely an increase in capital gains taxes are coming (plus the possibility of a Democrat party sweep which opens the door to new taxes on companies with Amazon). Even if you think Amazon will successfully navigate these items, do you believe they can navigate them within the time frame of your options?On the flip side....a lot of people have left a lot of money on the table by leaving Amazon too early.Ultimately you need to ask yourself which would you regret most, selling out of your Amazon options and missing out on watching your thesis become reality OR staying in those options (even if that means rolling them forward) and riding them to a steeper loss. Obviously neither are desirable but which worst case is the more comfortable one.Lastly, consider selling an equal number of same type, same expiration, options at a higher strike price. This will allow you to bring in some premium to offset your losses. Yes, it will cap your gains but maybe the risk reduction is wise. I’m pretty new to all this but one piece of advice I read everywhere is most people should never own open calls or puts. Spreads are highly advised.When I was getting into option trading my father (a finance professor) told me only one thing, “Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.”. That’s not entirely true. He also told me “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “FOMO is not an investing strategy”.You most likely have many years ahead of you. Make use of that time to generate real wealth. Don’t try to catch lightning.Good luck with your position.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-17 18:33:41'] I think your perspective is skewed (whose isn't in this crazy market).  AMZN has done frickin phenomenal since end of June, where it was trading in the 2600's  It's almost 3200.  Nearly 20% in 1. 1/2 months.  That's an enormous rise for a safe company with such a sure business model combined with crazy innovations (like web services) whose only real worry right now is anti-trust investigations.I'm holding a  jan15 3600/3700 debit spread, among others, and yeah,  I feel the same way you do sometimes.   Why isn't it moving even more!  I thought 4k was possible by end of year, but was too much risk for my taste, so I opted for the jan15 3600c, offset by selling a 3700c (hence the debit spread) Less money?  sure, I'm definitely willing to give up some profit to lighten the risk.  3600 (at least) is very probably to me by EOY.

This tells me they likely already took the hit in eanrings on the news last quarter but if they didn't sell those properties in the past three months,  then they could drag down earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 12:41:13'] I have some wild OTM AMAZON calls that I’m holding onto past earnings. I do expect them to absolutely smash earnings but I suspect the huge pump this week already priced that in and honestly I think it’s already overbought. Check previous earnings. They always have a run up in anticipation (this time possibly already happened) but often lose steam and the price falls after announcing. My feeling would be if you expect thePrice to rise this week, I would buy a cheaper premium OTM and probably look to buy Tuesday. I expect a red or a flat day Monday with the country being open. Premiums will be cheaper with less time on them and probably lower price. That’s the advice I wish I gave myself a few days ago.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 12:08:05'] Depends if their earnings are -90% or +90%
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 13:18:25'] There is always a risk no matter what you invest in. ITM AMZN calls are quite expensive. A massive amount of intrinsic and earnings potential are built into the calls. Be careful! If you are thinking about entering a call, the timing is everything! Depending on how the stock trades prior to earnings, you may want to take off the option and wait. I love amazon. I own the stock and trade the options all the time. But be careful!!

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-16 22:20:57'] If you’re going to do long calls, and you’re nervous about buying at the peak, just wait a while until it hits a resistant point and retracts, then buy then at lower premiums? We already saw a bit of a dip during AH and markets have been pretty volatile lately I doubt it keeps running up, if anything short/midterm puts now then calls after you sell those Just my opinion idk what the fuck I’m talking about but when I’ve bought calls on companies on a run for more than 4+ days or so I get burned a few hours later or very next day
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-16 22:27:06'] Suggest you to practice on paper trade for awhile.  If you think it will go up with an Friday expiration you need offer $4550 dollars for 1 CALL Contract  $2390 to be in the money. But if you think it will be lower you pay just $2930 at $2400 for a PUT Wanting a longer time decay pay more for June July expiration.  That means $19,500 for paying someone wanting to sell you and lose it all.The likelihood lose $4550 is high. I suggest you not mess with AMZN rather find some affordable stock like airline, cruise line, hotels that you think will do OK 3-4 months later.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-16 23:37:40'] I would be very reluctant to buy calls on anything right now after this run-up. Do not chase a stock that's on fire. Wait, and watch the moving avgs/supports.&#x200B;It is my  view that the market becomes a black hole in the next 2-4 months as I think this entire rally was just a nice bear-bounce, but that's my personal belief.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-17 00:29:13'] I have been holding Amazon since the stock was like 160, and adding and adding over the years.So I'm very long-term bullish on Amazon.I sold a bit in this run  to rebalance my portfolio and decided to convert some of that cash into options and had a similar dilemma as yours todayI therefore decided to get in now (did so this morning) with a leaps (AMZN 06/21 3000c). If it keeps running up from here, great I'm participating, but if it drops, and it will at some point between now and expiration, I would play the average down game by adding to my position.So the key it to initiate a partial position of what you fully intend to allocate to it. But at least I have a foot in the door and I can work from here instead of just staring at it with FOMO.

	COMMENT: ['2018-03-03 22:14:26'] Great fill.  I'm surprised as it is almost mid price of the bid/ask.  I usually need to give up a little to get such a fill.  In anycase, nice trade.  The short legs are outside of the 20 sMA and upper Bollinger Band.  There's an ascending upper trend line that puts AMZN at a max $1550 and a lower ascending trendline that puts it at a low of $1480 by expiry.  If it breaks out of either of those trendlines, I would close this one out, albeit at a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2018-03-03 08:58:12'] Ok so on the topic of iron condors - I'm seeing something really freaking odd and frankly, it seems "too good to be true".I hopped on ToS and started throwing OP's AMZN iron condor in, just to see how things looked. And in doing that I noticed when choosing to sell an iron condor in ToS, it goofs with the order of the four legs. Instead of listing the four legs as buy call/sell call/sell put/buy put (basically ordering the four strikes highest to lowest), it shows it as sell call/buy call/sell put/buy put. The strikes it fills in (based on whatever call/put strike you started with) are in the proper places for the orders, though, but it's offputting.But, if you're starting out deep OTM for the initial call, the puts it's filling in automatically aren't all that far below. So tinkering with iron condors on AAPL (a tenth of the mark of AMZN, just to see), when selling an IC on AAPL (sitting at 176 currently) at 190, it defaults the potential order thus:Sell call 190 / Buy call 192.5 / Sell put 187.5 / Buy put 185.Now to do a proper IC, one would adjust the puts to be equally below the current mark as the calls are above the current mark, if I understand the concept of the iron condor properly. But the credit showing for the above setup is 2.37, far above what it would be if the puts were adjusted down to where they "should" be. Setting it up for a single contract on each leg, ToS says the max loss is $13, max profit is $237.This can't be right, can it? 
	COMMENT: ['2018-03-03 15:50:34'] I could see it hit 1560 during the next 2 weeks but come back inside your range by expiration. Collecting 70-80% of premium is a rather high expectation..

POST_TEXT: b'### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week ** **SPY** finished the week above its bullish expected move, up 1.5% vs the 0.8% options were pricing. The SPY has moved more than its expected move and established new highs over the past few weeks, while its implied volatility (and expected move) has compressed as moves have mostly been in one direction to the upside.\n\n**This Week  SPY** options are pricing about a **0.7%** move (in either direction) for the upcoming (4 day) week. That corresponds to about **$429** as a *bearish consensus* and **$437** as a *bullish consensus*.\n\n**Implied Volatility**  The VIX was lower into the holiday weekend, closing at around 15. Thats the lowest levels of market implied volatility since pre-pandemic. In January 2020, before the Covid sell-off, the VIX was as low as 12. Its historical mean is near 19 but that incorporates long periods of time of low volatility (and the VIX in the low teens) with occasional bouts of extreme volatility and spikes in the VIX'
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-05 11:35:05'] Thanks for the information. I have a question. Not sure if I am wording this correctly, but would the tighter premiums for spreads and lower VIX mean that a CCS or a PCS placed at a lower delta be "safer" from being breached than if premiums were higher?

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 19:38:22'] Do you intend to actually exercise the option? I know you said you did but I just wanted to confirm since if that's the case you should be selling cash secured puts as LEAPS rather than buying the long version of LEAPS. This way you get a credit, very high (50%+), immediately and can sell slightly ITM without concern of actually having to pay ITM if you think the stock will rise above that point.These are also easier to close out and if assigned usually would represent your desire to own at a lowered price or could easily be closed for far less credit if you had to pay to buy them back and close them. If you want to go long though I would recommend you look for companies where the share value has dropped over 70% since that is likely the recovery value, presuming they are going-concerned, and a sound entry point.

POST_TEXT: b"#9/01 Update: Now that these are up over 100% from the time of posting, it's time to start taking some profit. I would sell at least your cost basis, potentially more. Leave one or two for any additional run up/gap fill. To all those who took this play, particularly the ones who reached out to me after the fact, ily <3\n\n----\n\nLets not make this complicated. \n\n1. $AMZN has been consolidating since its past earnings disappointment and has found solid support at the $3200 level. At $3300, its the time to at least initiate a position if you dont have one already.\n\n2. $AMZN currently sits at an IV rank of 1%. That means over the past year the IV has been higher 99% of the time. What makes IV swell? Earnings. What happens when IV swells? The price of the underlying option goes up. \n\n3. The S&P 500 is up 19.26% YTD, 30.66% over the past 365 days. $AMZN is essentially flat in both regards and is the worst-performing FAANG name on a yearly basis. Comparatively, FAANG names like $GOOG and $MS"
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 09:01:09'] This is incredibly well said. I have come to similar conclusions about AMZN and it is my highest conviction play at the moment. I have 3550/3750 spreads open for September 2022. They cost about ~6,500 each and they payout ~13,000 if AMZN is over 3750 in a year. I went with a year because then it will be a long term hold and not a short term one. It's still speculative because if the whole market has huge issues between now and then they will become nearly worthless, but considering AMZN reached that price just a couple months ago gives me an extreme amount of confidence in this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 14:21:10'] I think you did thorough research and I agree with most of what you're saying here. My only hesitation and point that I would bring up is the both QQQ and SPY are both trading at all time highs, and we haven't seen a real 5-10% pullback/correction since April. With the market trading super hot right now, delta looming and inflation data not looking good in the short term, I think we are more than due for at least a 5% pullback across many sectors, if not more so in big tech.Another interesting point of bullishness I can see for Amazon in terms of TA is looking at the One year chart with weekly candles and the 50 day Simple Moving Average. In the past year or so time frame, each time AMZN has dropped down to its 50SMA, it tends to bounce off it as support. As of today it seems to be using the 50SMA as support again and a green candle is forming. I would be inclined to agree with you that it is at a strong support level and your position seems well suited for strong gains

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 15:30:37'] mannnnn, I really love the idea of an AMZN LEAP for next June or Sept but I can only afford a 75 delta (wahh wahh I know) and then on top of that it'd be like 95% of my brokerage account so it's a huge risk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 17:09:35'] The strategy for filling an order by entering at one end and incrementally edging towards the other is great. If you’re trading just a couple of contracts at a time the difference might seem small, but it adds up!I would add that if you’re not planning on holding to expiration you should set up your exit by entering a limit order as soon as you’ve opened your position. I’m more impatient to see profits than I am greedy to maximize them ;)

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 16:59:40'] I'm a little confused at the stop limit example. I haven't used stops on options (stocks only) so maybe I'm missing something. But I don't understand the following. >For example, if you bought a call for $5 and you want to stop at $4, you can set the limit for a stop-limit at $2. The lower you set the limit, the less risk there is that a sharp drop will leave your order unfilled. But that doesn't mean you will only get $2. You'll get the best price that is above $2.I have a Call that I paid $5 for. If it drops below $4 market value, I want to close the position? Why am I setting a $2 stop?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 17:56:55'] Another reason not to use market orders - you don't have the NBBO price protection. It is possible a buy order fills above the ask or a sell order fills below the bid. Another reason not to use stops. Some stops will trigger off the mark. A wide spread at the open can cause a stop to trigger, then you're out of the position.

This was a lot of condensed information that I saved and will refer back to later. Regarding your limit orders in increments of .05, would this have a higher probability of filling at a minor discount to the ask only if the trade goes against you (i.e. the ask is coming down because the contract itself is losing value as the underlying equity is losing value? Or is this something you are not concerned with because you believe at the end of the day that the contract will gain value before expiration? Do you frequently find yourself going to the mark or you keep disciplined to never bid that high? How do you keep or settle on the bid and ask spreads and find the mark and your eventual limit price with enough time to get all the info into an order placed before they all fluctuate due to the actively trading market? Is that only an issue with really volatile stock?

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 16:35:50'] What do you think about using the theoretical value as the basis or starting point for your limit order? I tend to do this because I figure it's the most neutral price, since the bid/ask can skew one way or another depending on which way the market is moving.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 16:57:06'] I feel like one of those WSB apes reading this..
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 16:58:15'] What do most of you consider to be high bid/ask spreads?  I personally have been shying away from anything larger than a .20 spread.  I am relatively new to option trading but from what I see .05 and .10 seem to be the smallest spreads.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 17:01:10'] People should understand this before trading options but often learn the hard way, or don’t ever learn.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 17:01:28'] Wow I just learned a lot about something I needed to know. Thank you for this, it’s truly helpful
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 17:17:03'] Well said

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 18:43:04'] Excellent post and well written, thank you for your effort! I wish I read this months ago, but I'm not sure I would have actually understood it all then. It makes me feel more confident not only understanding everything written, but also knowing I practice these lessons. &#x200B;Thanks!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 18:43:23'] I just got another wrinkle in my smooth brain, great info
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 19:01:04'] Thanks for the write up. Bought some 1$ bombardier calls for may 21 today as a first attempt at options. We'll see how it goes, I definitely wish I had read this first lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 19:26:49'] What if I'm willing to pay the ask when I buy, or to receive the bid when I sell? Sometimes I simply want to get in or out of a trade, and I don't care about dicking around for a few dimes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 19:35:40'] OP - awesome write up. Would love some additional information on how to interpret IVOL vs. HVOL (30) vs. HVOL (50)... And anything else that is related and should be considered prior to entering into an options contact. Thanks in advance
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 19:41:18'] Thank you so much !
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 19:45:28'] Amazing post, learned a ton! Question though: when it comes to placing a limit order on an option, how do you personally determine what you're choosing it at?Edit: I did the good old reread and found it...jk haha

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 01:20:05'] Lots of work done there!Please change one sentence though - " Sometimes you need to increase your offer to get a fill, sometimes you need to wait patiently for the market to move towards you. "It unreasonably triggers me when people use the noun 'offer' when discussing bids.  It's ok if you are purchasing a house or car but not when talking about buying a financial instrument.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 02:42:13'] Just wanted to join the others in thanking you for taking the time to make this post.It really helps to make this feel like one of the best places to keep checking in with on the loooooooooong road to learning.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 04:26:25'] What is considered a wide bid/ask spread? I know that this may differ between individuals, curious to know how everyone deals with this. Personally I feel 1$ is the max spread I am able to accept. Thank you for the writeup!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 05:34:48'] Hey, does the thing you said about liquidity also apply to selling CCs and CSPs?I've only just started but I usually go for rather odd-ball strikes on contracts ($17.5 or $27) because they seem to also be the ones with the best premiums.True that usually after I open a trade it opens red but as theta decays the price usually turns in my favor. I have yet to come out with a loss on a contract I've sold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 05:54:07'] >The price of a contract is not defined by some kind of central authority or by a pricing model, it is discovered by active trading.this might sound like a pedantic argument, but there ARE pricing models for derivatives (e.g. BSM), and they are used by market makers to initiate the bid/ask when there are no ACTIVE trading.  You recognize it in the post, which contracts the earlier claim.>It is worth noting that for the most part, the active bids and asks you see in the auction are market makers. That is why a contract with 0 volume still has an active auction, because the job of market makers is to, well, make a market. That means to act as a buyer if you are selling and a seller if you are buying.they are in effect the "authority", setting the "menu prices", until "active trading" affects true price discovery.  there are millions of low-vol new/recent listings you can see it in effect.  and an option chain of low/zero vol trading with very clear pricing set isnt just 2 market makers sitting at Ask vs Bid playing chicken with each other.  that's probably a single MM setting both the Ask and Bid, waiting for any to take them on either side of the trade.  they are, in effect, "setting" the price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 06:45:25'] one thing to be aware of for the "creeping" order strategy only works for highly liquid options when your order size is small. For SPY or SLV the strategy can work very well. For larger orders of less liquid strikes (EA, or CNK would be a good example) creeping your order will cause the bid/ask to move up!!! it can easily add 5-10 cents because you gave time for the algos and the Market Makers to respond. For size in the less liquid, you can use a block order (i.e. force auction), break it up into small orders at the mid, or use different tenors/strikes
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 06:49:15'] I agree with most of your points but if you try to walk a bid up and think it will result in a best execution, would not be so sure. Whether in equities or options, high frequency shops will try to discern those types of orders and snipe anything that comes in at say, midmarket or better.    Some posted $2-$3 markets are really $1.75-2.25 (MM's trying to prop up quote) and others are really $2.5-$3. If you don't have the experience to have a sense of that (no one does when they start out), stick with tighter spreads.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 07:26:44'] What bid/ask spreads do people generally look for when entering a position? $0.05, $0.10, $0.20, $0.50?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 07:56:23'] Can you explain what the minimum increment of price is in the example you give $2/$3?  How do we identify that?  Thanks!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 09:19:21'] Wow, that's a ton of information! I want to get in on this action, where would I get started? I have an account with Schwab, can I use it to get going?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 09:29:17'] Thank you. I'm kind of new to this and this will save me some heartache and confusion i am sure.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 09:54:39'] I always love learning more about options. Thx!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 20:32:44'] Great content! I’m wondering if the each brokerage holds separate “auctions” or if all brokerages are in the same auction? Lmk if this makes sense
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-22 16:57:25'] I faced an interesting situation with the "mark" and P/L:  I sold an option on the silver futures contract (/SI).  It was pretty far OTM and fairly illiquid.  Just prior to the trading halt, the order book cleared out and the bid-ask became ridiculously large.  The result is that the mark shot up, and my contract showed as -$4,000 on the P/L.  This obviously had a big impact on my net liq and remaining buying power.  I keep pretty decent BP cushion, but could envision scenarios where if you have too many of these open, an artificially high mark caused by wide bid-ask could force your BP negative and potentially into a margin call.

Trading on or near expiration day.In positive termsTrade small, trade liquid options with a narrow bid ask, have a plan, close before expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 10:01:52'] That is a fucking dissertation and award you an honorary PhD. Been selling some CSPs and loving it. Like you said having margin to use for that is awesome and doesn’t require the heavy cash outlays. I understand assignment risk and doing 90% success rate in like $TSLA and $BYND and now $PTON. 10-15% OTM and weekly or 2 weeks DTE for that big theta. Ok I I will finish reading the other half of pt I. Should almost be required reading to join the sub.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 11:11:24'] This is exactly what I've been looking for...I want to learn but go slowly.  I know a lot of people are trying to just in now since the market is "hot" but the loss porn on WSB should be enough to scare people away...it isn't.  I've been buying stocks long all my life and was afraid of options but I'm getting more comfortable.  I just got so used to people saying how they could lose all their money trading options or read so many stories about people saying they were millionaires then lost it all trading options that is scared me away.  It seems like there is a conservative approach that can be profitable without risking the entire bank every time.  Thanks so much for this info!  I just added the book to my Amazon cart.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 09:40:20'] Super noob here, not to the market but to options. Been already reading several sites and vids you've already mentioned just to get a basic understanding. Already have an Etrade account for several years, just got approved for my level 1 trade. I'll be ordering Understanding Options, and reading up on the rest of your post and links, and will likel place my first CC on Tuesday, something simple and easy just to get my feet wet. Thanks for all of the info and I'll 'put' it to good use, lol.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 12:02:44'] This is the best breakdown/advice/knowledge i have ever seen on Reddit yet. Its just that my account is up 300% doing the opposite of everything you said. Got to read this multiple times and start trading correctly
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 13:07:16'] eTrade is my broker of choice as well. While not really for beginners, Quantcha is the go-to for advanced options stuff for their users. Just wanted to suggest it since everyone eventually graduates beyond what eTrade offers themselves. Now that you can connect profiles it’s as good as being part of their platform. Do your own dd since it’s expensive unless you’re trading at scale.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 08:38:02'] The volatility of the market right now is great for a strategy you mentioned above which I practice a lot, which is selling DITM puts on dips.  It locks in fairly safe gains but I never execute at a price I am not willing to own the stock at.  This market seems primed for March of 2000 drop, I think getting in and out of trades is key at the moment.  Not sure when the drop is coming, seems like around May, but it is coming!You also mentioned research, it is a great point lost on a few newbies who called me about GME and option exits.  Never get into positions without understanding the fundamentals of a company.  I was able to talk a couple of millennials into selling their hugely profitable calls in the mid $300's range prior to the move to $50.  They all thought GME was going to $1K, never a chance of that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 01:42:15'] I have followed you. I like your post, esp the opinion, which is everything that comes out of a human's mouth. I liked your description of how you responded to the GME and the need to plan, when things are moving relatively fast.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 03:14:27'] this is awesome! Thanks for putting the time to post this. I am still reading / listening / watching a lot of useful info like this before I pull the trigger on option trading.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:01:22'] What is really impressive about this post is that you’ve covered a comprehensive list of things to be aware of and at the same time, you’ve addressed each issue in a well thought out explanation that makes total sense. I do thousands of trades a year and have done well, but I have a tough time articulating what I do to others. This post inspires me to keep trying to share, and remember that there is a lot to it, and you can’t explain it in just a paragraph or even a single page.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 06:13:54'] This was incredibly helpful; thanks for the taking the time to put this together.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 10:37:58'] Thanks, this was a lot of useful info for newbie like myself. I have start puts on stocks I want to own at support.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 12:05:01'] Nicely done. Yes, the post has opinions laced with definitions and could very easily lead people down a risky path in a bear market. But, this is easily the best 101 anyone new might need. I would suggest adding more resources etc. Thanks for putting this together. Fantastic job!!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 10:17:34'] Thanks for the write up! New to options here. I find that there are quite a few camps in terms of brokers: etrade vs TOS vs td Ameritrade (unless that's TOS, can't remember), and tastyworks-- although tastyworks appears to be the least of these.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 10:49:45'] Thank you so much for this OP. I suffered massive losses last year as a newbie trader (TSLA if you've heard of it :-), but had massive gains in terms of learning lessons! These are wonderful tips.I'd add my own "tip": suffer a massive loss. If you're like me, you'll realize that mistakes are not real. Lessons are. I tell myself there is not a successful trader out there who hasn't taken a big, catastrophic hit. It's a badge of honor IMO (to the extent speculation can be considered "honorable"). I can't say I'm a "good" trader now, but can definitely say I'm not a newbie anymore :-) Let's all get rich or go broke trying this 2021!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 13:18:34'] I know selling naked calls is always a big no no, because loss limit is almost infinite, but selling naked puts is alright as long as you have the capital to purchase 100 shares incase you get assigned? Is that by nature a CSP, ensuring that you have the capital when selling your puts?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-14 20:07:30'] One thing I don’t get is EVERY “how-to” and “beginners” options videos beat a dead horse with talking about how an option is only worth something when it expires ITM.They COMPLETELY disregard the fact that options can be traded.The analogy would be almost like teaching in a beginners stock market course that the only purpose of stocks is to pay dividends and to have voting rights in a company (sure, those are purposes... again, more relevant for the wealthy), and completely disregarding the trading aspect of stocks.

Basically left the company because she knew it was going to go tits up. I have no position with SKLZ and it's already dropped so much that I'm not going to bother shorting it because fraudulent companies (NKLA,RIDE) can last much longer than you think. Buyer beware.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 03:31:40'] AFAIC, "Options as a Strategic Investment" by Lawrence G. McMillan is the best option  book that I have ever read.  It's well written with many clear examples. 1,000+ pages book.      The early chapters will give you a fundamental understanding of covered calls, synthetically equivalent short puts, and spreads. Read them and then read them again.     It also explains a variety of other option strategies and should they intrigue you, you can read more.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 23:08:17'] It’s a great book. I’ve read it twice. However, it really isn’t a book for beginners in options. Better to read it when you know the basics already, have a little experience and want to dig in deeper. A lot of focus on the Greeks, setting up neutral strategies, and a lot of stories of trades from his past. It’s a lot of detail, and not an easy reading book.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 06:21:50'] I'm new to options. If I got a slightly older edition(3rd) would it still be a benefit or have options changed much over a few years?

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 18:07:15'] Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can’t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.So I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. Next day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.From my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.I consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-27 16:44:45'] You said you were new at options. First item is IV. With earnings coming up, you should be aware of IV crush that will occur the next day. You'll need a good move up to counteract the IV crush loss.If your intention is to hold through earnings, I would not roll. If you get a big move up, both calls will perform. If you don't get a big move up, either call will be screwed. You would be sending good money after bad.Earnings tend to be a crap shoot. I don't play earnings any more...

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 22:33:02'] Good DD, I think I'm employing a similar strategy. Premiums looked very good so I picked up 10k shares at $1.36 to sell CC. Ended up acquiring 15k more shares selling CSPs with a cost basis of $1.67 a share now. Planning on continuing to sell CC to lower the basis. The longer I'm in the play the more I think I'm gonna stick around, if volatility holds should be able to lower my basis considerably quite quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 23:15:34'] Good DD, if there was a chance to get in sub $1, and sell covered calls to take advantage of the IV and cost average down, would be an awesome play.Not sure if anything $2 and above is a good entry point unless you’re trying to catch a quick run up, take a quick gain and get out.

About to buy in again, and wait for another spike, it's inevitable. With the u.s. about to decriminalize I expect the Canadian market to boom along with it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 12:21:48'] The only interesting play on SNDL is if you believe volatility will stay outrageous for the 3-6 month time horizon.  Then you can buy now and sell CCs to keep lowering your cost basis very rapidly, to the point it doesn't matter if it's a P&D.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 14:35:41'] You can go to the OCC for the official way that options will be handled with a split, simply search your ticker here:[https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search)With a split you may find that liquidity dries up on the 'old' options, which will lead to wider spreads/slippage.  Personally, I'm more bullish on Google and Amazon and Not GME.  The former make money. GME does not.

POST_TEXT: b'I got on the wrong side of the ford earnings play Friday. Still have the contract for $19 2/25. In an effort to make up the losses I bought a $30 call 2/18 contract for peloton. When I bought the contract on Friday I want to say IV was over $100. It climbed most of the day and ended the day at 171. My question is I am relatively aware of IV crush after earnings but when there is an insane unexpected jump does IV crush occur then or will it open tomorrow at like 300% IV? Any insight is appreciated'
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 14:04:28'] You’re 30 call for pton is going to print tomorrow regardless of iv as long as it opens up around the same as it was after hours. Iv will also most likely go up with earnings coming up. I would close the position Monday and not wait for earnings. Your probably gonna be up like 10x

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:40:20'] The IV will most likely spike on the open Monday morning. After the market has time to digest the news you may see the IV come back off.I would think IV will remain elevated unless there is a 100% deal. Until then, many possibilities are on the table and therefore the IV should remain higher imo.&#x200B;Edit: If you are looking to hedge, remember that you control 100 shares with your option. SO you could sell, say 75 shares of stock and hold the remaining 25 as a lotto ticket. Or something like that.You would need to have the right accounts and permissions (margin) to sell short the stock

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 19:32:41'] I like your hedge. My only question is why hedge with DIA puts? It's my opinion that in the case of a correction, the DJIA wouldn't drop nearly as much as something like SPY or QQQ.As the Dow Jones is price weighted and contains mostly (if not all) value stocks, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are market cap-weighted and contain more growth stocks.The frothiness of this market haves me thinking that if there is a correction, the market cap-weighted ETFs containing more growth stocks will take a bigger hit (SPY and QQQ), with DIA receiving some flight-to-safety from sold equities in the former.Would love to hear your thoughts on this!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 21:03:01'] Big fan of the pltr play. Looks like that’s paying off already. I’d agree with some of the other comments on market correction plays. I think it’s very unlikely we see a major correction until 2022 with hopium, vaccines, and stims otw. Will probably wait to buy QQQ put leaps later this year
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 20:45:33'] Figured I'd post this here since you got me looking into it.QQQ April 300 puts currently have 60.8k open interest, with 1.2k volume (and 29.7% IVx).A 10% drop in Nasdaq within the next 54 days would be required for these puts to be ITM. Their current mid price is 5.07, and the current mid price for ITM contracts is 13.53.This would be a 266% ROI with no change in IV. 54 days isn't a huge window, and the ROI numbers are even better for March contracts (albeit a smaller window of 26 days).. but this looks interesting, and I'll definitely be looking into it more tomorrow.**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. This is chicken-scratch math I did running on almost no sleep. This is meant to provoke discussion on similar hedging positions.**

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 22:51:22'] Your math on the discord puts doesn’t work out exactly. 50 dollars down both ways is a misleading way to look at it since 50 dollars is a higher percentage of 150 than 330. This means the Dow would lose more value per dollar as a percentage of total  in the 100-150 range than the 300 range. Still seems extremely profitable and I will consider picking some up, but I’m not seeing a big market crash for a couple years. Way overdue for another September correction though
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 19:49:01'] If the Dow is below 9500 in a year we are well and truly fucked and a few puts aren't going to save us. Appreciate the frequent updates though!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 09:08:41'] That Dow put is an excellent idea. Thanks for that. I might go with the Nasdaq myself since it ran up more than everything else the last year. Or do a mix of both.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 19:56:55'] Great post as always, pleasure to read.How do you calculate the potential profit (or protection) on that hedge?I can understand the calculation of the cost, but how do did you forecast the outcome of possible 20x-50x?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 20:16:04'] I don’t like the hedge. The Dow is probably the least overvalued out of all the averages. And if we finally get the infrastructure push we expect to get from this administration, I see another 30% increase in the industrials.  That calculus has even better odds if interest rates start to climb back up, as they likely will, giving the banks more fuel. If you want a hedge play, why not buy puts on the QQQ?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 17:03:41'] Nice analysis man. I added small amounts to pltr and nio today, although disappointing to see nio crash below its 50 DMA today.I opened a 55/60 dec vertical debit spread on NIO today as well, I'm hoping it'll be atleast $60 by eoy and I can collect 50k off the spread. Its not guarantee though its trading almost a double to tesla's EV/S, so it's very over valued. Just hoping the sales growth can keep justifying the lofty valuations atleast through the end of the year. Oh my hedge is vixy calls dated July ish I believe. Pros to that are they can pop like crazy but the con is that they are expensive AF. I think your hedge is a little better. I thought of selling some puts at $10 to offset the cost, but the prems were so low.

POST_TEXT: b"**Markets**\n\nLast week saw short squeezes in a handful of names, selling pressure in the major indices and a huge spike in options volatility across the board.\n\nWith the VIX now above 30, **SPY** options are pricing a nearly **3%** move by Friday. Thats more than double what options were pricing at the beginning of last week. You can see what that corresponds to for a bullish/bearish consensus on the [chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-31-at-10.18.10-AM.png) (based on Friday's close)\n\nFor the full month we can compare **SPY**, **QQQ**, and **IWM**, with the largest expected move in IWM: [chart](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-01-31-10-16-23.2021-01-31-10_17_35.gif)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Meme Stonks**\n\nHeres a comparison of expected moves for the next month in a handful of the meme stocks, Gamestop, AMC, Nokia, Virgin Galactic and Blackberry via the Options AI calculator.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 14:29:52'] I've got a question. How come some calls at a higher strike price will be worth more than calls at a lower strike price but with the same expiry?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-01 01:04:42'] I've tried a few options in the past but I think the timeframe was too short, usually only a week.  Do most people target a month out? Also is the premium normally equal to the interest in the option? Like the higher the premium the more popular those options are?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-01 12:34:12'] I see you (op) have answered numerous questions here. If I could ask one more: when I am looking at the options AI charts, is that averaged across a range of strike prices, or one specific one? I assume a $10 AMC call will not move the same as a $30 AMC call. Sorry if this is low-level.Also, does this say that a 2/xx contract is supposed to move y% between now and expiration? Like thats the projected range it could vary to at any time between now and expiration?

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 22:26:36'] It could get pretty real next week.Settlement in the world's financial system is largely managed by the DTCC (through its subsidiaries the NSCC and the FTD).According to[ https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887\_Naked\_Short\_Sales\_and\_Fails\_to\_Deliver\_An\_Overview\_of\_Clearing\_and\_Settlement\_Procedures\_for\_Stock\_Trades\_in\_the\_US](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887_Naked_Short_Sales_and_Fails_to_Deliver_An_Overview_of_Clearing_and_Settlement_Procedures_for_Stock_Trades_in_the_US) (page 7) when a seller sells short a share that they don't deliver within the normal settlement timeframe, the seller is issued a "fail to deliver" (FTD), and the buyer is issued a "fail to receive" (FTR). The seller must then maintain a deposit with the cash equivalent of the security (that can sometimes be "marked-to-value" if the market value changes a lot) and eventually pay back the FTD so that the FTR can be converted into a share.If the seller screws up and doesn't have enough cash, the NSCC goes after all their assets and they're banned from participating in the NSCC in the future. If they don’t have enough money, the NSCC is forced to pay for the security to replace the FTR. It has a clearing fund of $USD 10,518,890,000 as of Q3 last year ([ https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/financials/2020/NSCC-Financial-Statements-Q3-2020.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/financials/2020/NSCC-Financial-Statements-Q3-2020.pdf) ) to pay for stuff like this.If the NSCC runs out of money to replace security for the FTR, the membership organizations are on the hook for the cash per Rule 4, Sec 4:[https://www.dtcc.com/\~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc\_rules.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf)Currently, there are like 3000 members including most major US banks (here's the list:[ https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/nscc-directories](https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/nscc-directories) ).The NSCC also has Clearing Agency Cross-Guaranty Agreements with other entities like the DTC and FICC that have tons of cash in their own clearing funds and are also required to help pay if the NSCC runs out of cash.So yeah, if Citadel/Melvin/Brokerages/Shorties go broke and don't have enough money to deliver GME shares to APEX or the NYSE or any other member of the NSCC, this is who ends up paying, and they have deeeeeeeeep pockets because they are literally the collateral backing up the world's entire financial clearing system.But they might have to pay out all that dough if Gamestop is worth infinity because no apes ever sell their bananas. 💎 🙌 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀 🚀We like the company.

POST_TEXT: b"I bought  WFM leap calls in Jan 19 about a week ago. Now, with the merger, my broker is telling me that they will expire  on Sept. 15th! When I originally paid for them, time value (theta) was built into that premium. Doesn't seem fair that I now have only two weeks left on the option when I paid to have 2 years of time. Can someone help clarify? Maybe I got this wrong."
	COMMENT: ['2017-08-30 07:37:43'] The final WFM stock price is set and won't change between now and when the leap expires. The final value of the leap was set when the final WFM price was set (it's a cash deal). All of the theta was drawn out of the option when the deal closed. There is no reason for the option to keep trading. It's basically an option on a fixed amount of cash.

POST_TEXT: b'Growth names were taken to the slaughter house this week. Why? Inflation headlines and rates are SPOOKING the market. Growth stocks and high-beta names are more effected by rates-headlines due to the fact that these companies need to maintain exponential revenue growth in order to maintain their expensive valuations.\n\nThese are risky times in the market with a lot of uncertainties and if you follow Reddit or Twitter youll probably see many posts about how the next crash is coming, but is it really? The dip last week may have provided for some opportunities in several of the higher-end growth names.\n\nAlthough these uncertain periods create volatility in the market, time has shown that buying the dip is a strategy that works and those who do it are usually rewarded. Thats not to say markets dont crash or go through corrections, but playing the long game and cost-averaging positions is one of the most profitable strategies. On the other end of this, and the most risky, is *day-tradin'

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-27 23:30:26'] This is cool but in terms of strategy you generally want to be long vega on options that have low IV relative to HV, or if you're doing a calendar spread you could look at the IV slope.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-27 23:38:19'] This is legit, 45 day IV rank probably works best to find cheapest premiums Most likely interested in option prices 21days to 45 days out. Anything shorter is fd and probably every stock qualifies just on theta decay alone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-11 06:07:52'] I learned from the first edition, an old copy that my dad had. Years later I bought the 4th edition. The worst thing I recall is that it talks about high commissions that don't really exist anymore, and the first edition would reference getting quotes from the newspaper and time-flow problems that don't exist now.2nd edition added index options and futures3rd edition added LEAPS, CAPS, and PERCS4th edition removed CAPS and added 5 new chapters, including volatility tradingSorry, don't know about the 5th edition.

They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep. This bet looks like they arent expecting earnings to move Amazon that much and are trying to capitalize on the premiums from high volatility at the moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmbnwrr56ub51.png?width=2748&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a4205ba840cb7a1aadc55cf4e07babe4b42d58b\n\n**BAB'

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 09:38:23'] Very good stuff.I agree that it's a terrible idea to revenge trade. You might buy a contract that eventually goes in an unfavorable position and close at a huge loss. Then you might attempt to open another position once you see the stock going back up and end up losing even more money due to it being a fake pump. It's better to take a loss and find another stock that has much higher potential (ie TSLA ;) )

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 18:39:30'] Hey, thanks for taking time to put this together.I have seen horror stories, but I don't understand how it's possible. Do you mind explaining the reasoning behind the need to close the spreads?  Robinhood uses cash collateral to cover potential maximum loss.  If at 4pm options are OTM they expire worthless.I thought options can only be traded between 9:30 and 4.  So how can an option be exercised after hours?  And if someone can exercise option I sold after hours, why can't I exercise option that I bought after hours?

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-24 16:57:00'] Congrats on starting out and actually doing it.I'd develop your ability to evaluate, value and otherwise perform due diligence, learn to be able to say why something will move the way it will, well, that's the nearly unobtainable goal but at the very least understanding the macro indicators so that when stuff is moving opposite to how your thinking you can also understand it. The market is rational, until it's not, each stock has its behavior that broadly follows the market and everything changes in time. Making money in this market is not the same as it was 2 years ago nor will it be the same 2 years from now. Beyond learning to evaluate Price/book, earnings, cash flow, debt and sentiment there's many methods of trading options. Butterflies are often used in trading, iron condors almost never, learning what options strategy to employ beyond call and put spreads can help develop your trader acumen. I'd recommend having multiple targets spanning sectors, start looking at the finviz maps and choose by sector. I think https://www.earningswhispers.com/ is useful for sorting and looking at different targets.good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 14:41:28'] One thing to keep in mind...If you own AAPL stock and some weird surprise bad news comes out this week, it will take a dip but you still own the stock and you can just wait it out until it recovers.Your money is never really at risk unless catastrophic news comes out and it turns out the company is a big fraud and goes bankrupt.I don't really see that happening. But the first scenario is a real possibility. Rare and unlikely, but real. Like when news came out that some iphones were spontaneously bursting into flames.But now imagine you have all your money invested in AAPL calls that expire a few days after that news comes out... If it is below your strike on the expiration day, then you lose all of it. Buying an option means buying something with an expiration date and you never want to be left holding the bag of flaming dog poop on the expiration date.That's why it is critical to diversify or to keep most of your account in cash. Yes, AAPL is an amazing company and the stock SHOULD always go up. But short term moves are normal and should be anticipated. Don't over commit to one position or strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 08:54:49'] While I am far from overly successful, I think the only thing that matters in an options trade is knowing when to apply your type of trade and how to construct it so the probability of profit is elevated enough that even if you get the strength of the move incorrect, you can still exit a trade with only a scratch at worst.For me that means trading spreads.  It cuts a lot of the downside risk out of these positions and depending on what my thesis is regarding an underlying's future move, I can construct something that statistically even if I am wrong, has a fighting chance of letting me get out with a little bit of something.  That means the majority of trades have a credit spread component to them ad only when certain parameters line up do I look towards a debit trade.This is what makes options in a sense easier than shares.  In shares, I am either right about the direction or I am wrong.  I either lose money or make money.  For instance in a credit spread, I can still be a little bit wrong or get the timing wrong and I still make money.  I think the biggest issue people have with trading options is they see that little infinity symbol on the long call max profit and they go braindead because to them, they can pay $10 for this call and turn it into a house.  When in reality, they turned that $10 into a $10 loss 99.999% of the time.

A few do it well, many don't even understand the risks.Adding complexity to try and become profitable. Almost all six or eight legged trades are bad ones. If a person can't make money with simple strategies, complexity just increases costs.So trade small, trade with a plan, trade liquid options and you have a chance. Odds are still against any single person being that unicorn.My number one suggestion is to keep a simple trading journal. Learn from your mistakes.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nWe use Linear Regression to analyse the Nasdaq Index (IXIC). Linear Regression analysis uses past data to predict future trends. A linear regression channel can be thought of as an equilibrium point and a standard deviation equilibrium line can provide support or resistance. 1 standard deviation means 68% of the data is within +/-1 standard deviation equilibrium line and 2 standard deviation means 95% of the data is within +/-2 standard deviation equilibrium line. The Nasdaq (IXIC) is now running at the top of the channel and has only moved through the top of the channel in the 2000, after incorporating 20 years of Nasdaq data. According to statistics, there is a 95% chance that the Nasdaq will move within this linear reversion channel, so be aware of this and be careful.\n\nAs we can see, the Nasdaq has now pulled back from the top, so we can watch out for a short period of overselling.\n\nHowever, we have mentioned before that the US stock market has been in a seven-year crash cycle s'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 08:55:19'] If the stock market were simple enough to be accurately modeled with linear regression, we'd all be billionaires. First of all, you don't even specify how long. Are you saying there's a 95% chance for it to remain within this channel until the end of time? Aside from that, how you actually interpret this chart is: "historically, the Nasdaq has spent 95% of its time within this channel", not "there is a 95% chance the Nasdaq will move within this channel". As you should know, price movements follow a random walk and lack stationarity, meaning they have no predictable pattern. What you are doing is assuming the Nasdaq will follow this pattern for no reason other than it fitting within your colorful lines of best fit and I can assure you the stock market is infinitely more complex than you believe it to be.

POST_TEXT: b'I am not a trader but an investor. This is more a general post for comment. In this post I share about how options work in tandem with my overall portfolio.  It is about 20% cash, 100% long on stocks and 20% short (net overall) on options, quite often covered calls showing negative value on aggressively moving stocks.\n\nCovered Calls (CCs) are a big part of  my approach. I use CCs to squeeze more juice out of my returns. It is my "go to" options move, but I am mostly in uncovered or long positions in stocks. Maybe 30% of the names will be in covered calls at a given time, but I usually invest in uncovered shares alongside the covered positions, so even here I participate in the upside.\n\nOne issue is I am constantly rolling each month. But the approach has worked the past few years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 03:45:13'] Wow started reading and 1/2 hour later here I am. Nice detail OP. I think it is fine and if works for you and beating the market. Rock on for sure. I too am a long term investor, but deploying several tactics in a much more aggressive manner at moment. This is due to bull thesis since last Oct and thru 2021. I have my core positions but have been killing on SPACs. I have been getting high returns on underlying and selling CCs and CSPs. Learned to get 125+ shares  so my high fliers will still be left w shares at the end if I still like the stock. I am all in the market. That is just my thesis. I have margin if I see an opportunity and I also use margin to sell CSPs into. I also sell CCs on my long term holds like AAPL ADM WBA CSCO etc. one thing is that I have so many damn stonks and options that is spilling into my day job. I need to slow down the weekly plays at least until I exit said job, which will be much sooner if these returns keep up. Will be nice to control my 401k too when the time comes. Good luck to you and everyone w their strategy. See you on the other side.Edit 4 typos.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 07:34:12'] I do them 2 ways :.If I want to keep the stock I sell strikes delta 0.30 - 0.35ish to collect weekly premium. This is with stocks I own beta 1 or lower (F, KO, T, GE etc)If I want to take the premium  only I buy high IV stocks and sell the call strike delta. 040 ish (ATM), I have been doing this with SNDL, IDEX, SENS, AMC etc and other High IV stocks, I've been collecting nice premiums and if my stocks are sold, I'm OK. I.E. I bought 1000 stocks of SNDL and sold 10 calls at 0.44 each, collected the premiums and my stocks were sold anyways..
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 05:01:19'] Well written and very informative. It didn't make me feel dumber by reading it like some of the nonsense I read elsewhere... I just started investing last year with a relatively small portfolio, but covered calls on cheap stocks have been one of my top strategies used until last month when a number of my positions (fcel,amc) started going up much faster than expected and I had to make some tough decisions. BTW, I made my reddit account 4 yrs ago but never used it until recently and apparently that means I can't post some places.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 03:44:10'] Needs more 🚀......No I’m jk this is a great strategy and I do this on almost all my stocks monthly. I don’t go out as far time wise, and further out strike wise, because I don’t actually want to sell my long positions in things like T and XOM which are my two largest holdings. You can make a nice monthly income doing so, but it requires a lot of shares to make it worthwhile.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 14:30:59'] I use a strategy I call the Value Creation Strategy. Basically, it works by purchasing 100 share blocks of stocks and selling CCs on those shares. I target stocks that are scheduled to go ex-dividend within the option cycle. This captures the dividend, a capital gain and the premium. This purpose of this strategy is to play a short game on a long stock. If the contract(s) execute, I win three ways by collecting the dividend, the premium, and the capital gain. If is expires worthless, I collect the dividend and retain the premium and sell another CC the following month setting up a second premium payment and the potential capital gain. Many of these VCS plays rotate for months before the shares actually sell maximizing the premiums.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 07:36:43'] In a bull market, a safer approach is selling covered calls for a shorter duration. As stocks will generally rise, a call holder will lose out on major gain opportunities if the stock shoots past the strike price. OP has touched on that, but he should highlight it as a serious danger; writing covered calls aren’t a long strategy, they’re a *short* strategy, because you don’t want the stock to go up; you want it to stay flat, below your strike, or even go down slightly (so you can close the call position early, for a profit.)I’m guessing OP has experienced that often — and so have I, which is why I now only set calls for 1-2 months out, max.My solution for a suddenly rising stock that I’ve covered is to also write a put at or above the strike, to capture the premium on the upside.But I am surprised that OP is satisfied with 10% above S&P. He’s going through a lot of work to eek out a modicum of gain.(By way of anecdote, I’m up over 100% this past year— 3x the S&P— averaging 10% *per month* and could have done substantially better still, if I held my positions longer.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 09:08:07'] This is a great overall strategy. I think you rightfully point out that one of the biggest disadvantages is the fact that you sometimes have to sit out the big runs. That's typically why some people with say to keep CCs to big slower growers because if you are holding the risk of a volatile stock you want to make sure there is enough potential upside. I think right now IV in a lot of names is incredibly high and can make these trades a no brainier even if there's a risk of a large draw down. Two other suggestions I'd add:1. Sometimes I make shorter term or more aggressive trades in names I like. For example buying calls in a name I am long equity heading into ER. When these trades work I typically take a portion of the profit and invest it back into the underlying and so I essentially grow my share count with "house money". This can be a good way, even with CCs to move your share count from 100 to 200 so you can participate more in the upside like you mentioned, while psychologically silo'ing the risk so you don't feel you're risking fresh capital in a riskier name like a SPCE. 2. This one is a bit contraversial right now with all the short squeeze mania happening, but I use "Stock Yield Enhancement" on IBKR. If you are unfamiliar, brokers only lend margined stock to short sellers, but certain brokers will allow you to opt in to lending your fully paid for stock and they split the interest with you. The main downside is you lose your voting rights on those shares if they are lent, but aside from that it functions essentially the same. So if you are holding a more volatile name like AMC, GME etc and selling CCs you can juice it a little more by allowing your shares to also be sold short. A lot of people don't realize that this is possible, but you are allowed to own the stock + sell CCs + lend shares short at the same time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 06:24:38'] First congratulations on your success. A thing to keep in mind is volume on these OTM CC when you want to close the position. Also market chameleon is great to look up IVs on a stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 06:41:09'] Enjoyed the post. I have traditionally used covered calls, but always closer in strike prices as I typically don't want to be assigned,  Thank you for the info
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 14:54:21'] You can use long leaps and write covered calls on them. I write CC on many of my holdings and just roll them weekly or monthly. It’s a nice little stream of revenue!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 10:31:06'] How much have you paid in commissions over the years? I guess it's worth it if you're beating the market. And I realize the industry is quickly going toward zero cost in the USA (unfortunately not in Canada). But it wasn't always that way in the last 20 years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 10:38:18'] I’ve really wanted to do covered calls, but always find that selling the credit spread is worth far more the money without having to own the stock. I have kept an open mind to it, trying to find instances where that’s not the case. Because I like the idea of collecting money from premium if the stock doesn’t go up, or getting a profit if it gets ITM.Question OP, when you inevitably have to sell when you’re itm, what’s your plan to get those stocks back? Do you just buy at the current price, or sell a cash secured put?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 11:30:51'] Thank you for sharing your methods!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 11:32:44'] Just started doing covered calls on my long term positions in the last quarter of 2020.  Good read, going to see how I can incorporate some of the structure you have built, look forward to additional detail on rolling.  I've been a bit more haphazard about it and have been caught out with a big spike gain on a couple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 19:09:44'] Thank you for this. This is a very educational post and I appreciate your sharing. How would you recommend someone starting off, getting their feet wet in covered calls? I've done leaps before, but haven't felt too comfortable expanding beyond that. Id hate to experiment on my TSLA shares also.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 22:31:15'] Thanks for sharing. You are the 2nd person I’ve encountered that does this. I also do this. My approach is much simpler; I hold long on developed large cap with dividends and use CC to increase cash flow and ROI, which is used to buy more stocks I own. I usually keep cash for dips to help cost average down. I think my return is 12-14%.  Congrats on your success and keep it going!!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 20:15:50'] Question, I will be selling one of my rental properties and hope to walk away with 180-240k. I know that If I don’t re invest in real estate 1031. I will be taxed on capital gains. Would you try to take that amount of buying power and run covered calls all year and hope to make enough to pay all the taxes from the sale ?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 07:44:40'] You're not buying and holding if you're selling covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 11:03:51'] The issue with covered calls, no dividends
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 12:54:11'] You say that covered calls protect against a sharp downward move compared to cash secured puts, but you’ve got that opposite. CCs and CSPs are essentially the same trade, but due to better liquidity with OTM options it is easier to construct a CSP with a lower break even point in case of a downturn. Less upside in an upward move, for sure, so I don’t disagree with your approach, but your reasoning for this particular point is wrong.

Now I see it was published in 2012, lots of things could have changed since. Is it still relevant in today\'s market?\n\nEdit: thank you for the feedback everyone, just ordered a copy. BTW it\'s 50% off at amazon right now if anyone needs a new one.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 06:42:55'] It's a great reference book but I would highly suggest having some knowledge of Calls/Puts before going into it. Think of it as more of an advanced college level book. Most options "strategies" haven't changed over the last couple decades. You'll find most options to be slightly more volatile or changes in IV because of the higher amount of retail traders dabbling into the options market (recent article about the last few yrs and the significant increase in retail options trading is interesting). Most of the technical indicators people utilize have held the same. There is a reason it's still one of the highest rated books. A little expensive compared to the amount of free content through YouTube but I would say it's nice to see it on paper and have it laid out in front of you with expertly written processes. A lot of YouTubers will just ramble on about different strategies but their actual thought process can be hard to follow a lot of times, esp when you are talking about 100's of thousands of videos and millions of hours of content to sift through. Finding a legitimate source that is not in it for clicks/some BS PDF sales pitch/subscription for discord can be challenging.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 10:48:58'] This is a really good resource and worth getting (even if it is an old version). Most of the information is relevant. The book gives you a good base about options, and it keeps you away from all the 'free' online resources from marginal sources that have a secret agenda (i.e., selling a newsletter, a chat room, etc.).Remember a book has to be good if it is in its fifth edition. If this book was crap, it would never get a second edition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 07:54:08'] Considering that the stock market players still rely on ancient Japanese wisdom from the 17th century I would say that it sounds pretty contemporary.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 11:01:23'] Absolutely. Been trading for 15 years and always come back to Options as strategic investment. Extremely comprehensive, encyclopedia for options strategies and ways to use options that you would not typically think of.  The depth and practical application of the strategies is really good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 07:03:31'] Best way to learn about options is to do some research for a few days/weeks. Then papertrade and backtest your strategies. Then jump into an option that you did some good DD on.Good DD: Seeing if the company has good financials, what is their long term debt? how much money do they make every quarter? Every year? What is their Free Flow Cash? What is their dividend like? Do they take care of their investors? What does the chart look like?You can look up all of this information in less than 30 mins.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 06:07:24'] There’s a million free resources online and YouTube that’s up to date. Just use those. Options Alpha podcast older episodes are good ways to learn.

POST_TEXT: b'If you sold the Feb 17 AMZN 740/730 put spread, which seems like a fairly safe bet since the stock would need to drop 10%. You would have a max loss of $875 (740-730-1.25) with max profit of of $125. Would this be a smart trade? And would you need a large amount of margin to enter this trade? The delta of the 740 put is 0.09. Still new to options so any feedback would be appreciated. '
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-13 21:14:03'] There are richer credits to be had but to answer your questions it's not a bad trade if you are comfortable with that risk. I try to get a least 1.50 in credit on put credit spreads or 3.00 minimum when I make it a condor. The margin requirement for your trade is typically 1000. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-14 02:40:08'] The margin requirement is 1000 (10 spread width x 100) but you deduct the credit you received, so your buying power effect and max loss is 875.It's not a bad trade.  By the delta you provided you currently have about a 90% chance of success.  Keep an eye on it though.  This chance of success changes with time.
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-14 07:17:17'] You have a little under a 90% chance of profit.  A large downmove is not out of the question though.  There is a reason those puts are bid.  For example, earnings is coming up in a few weeks.Only time will tell if it is a good trade or not.  But I will say it isn't one I'd make.  I like to collect a more on a spread like that.  On a ten dollar spread, I'd aim for  between $3.30 and $3.40.
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-17 14:15:20'] IC when I think the underlying stock will stay within a range, put spread when I'm bullish, call spread when I think the underlying will be flat or go down in value.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-31 09:33:38'] It trades well once spreads are $20+ wide.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-31 09:26:26'] Liquidity looks pretty choppy at over 1.00 on monthlies.  Most people here on the sub probably wouldn't touch it just based on liquidity alone. I'd probably consider it but it's just too rich for my blood. What broker are you using?  Most good brokers will let you put in a limit order for the entire combo at once and quote you the bid ask on the entire combo.  if you go halfway between the mid and ask you should get filled pretty quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-31 10:27:04'] I’ve traded spreads on a number of occasions.    Have also shorted against stock.   You’ll get a fill.  But it might not be where you want it.    
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-31 23:08:09'] I don’t think it’s the liquidity. Since the price for the stock is really high; the market maker needs to take some risk off by widening the bid ask by collecting .50-.70 off the top round trip = $1.00-$1.50. But if you have the BP; selling far otm puts were amazon will never tank on is been making it rain.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-20 18:41:41'] Just because put volume is increasing, doesn’t necessarily mean that the sentiment is bearish. You don’t know if it’s institutions or hedge funds using puts as a hedge for their true position. Similarly, it’s important to realize that puts can be bought or sold to open or close. Sometimes these puts are being used as legs for what could be a multi-leg option strategy. So just don’t blindly follow a large put volume and think “bearish”. Do your own research.

Many businesses are already weighing the possibility of telecommuting and the only real competitor is Google Meet.  With more businesses going down this road and would likely stick to it even after the pandemic due to the savings of telecommuting, there is a very real chance that Zoom's current value has not even come close to its potential.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 00:04:56'] ZM is such an oddball. How hard can it be for one of Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, hell even Discord to just wipe them off the internet? So many big companies competing for that video call market, and while ZM has good quality and ease of use for professional environments, I don't understand how these other companies aren't able to do it as good or better. I'd argue Discord, FB, and AAPL already have the call quality down, it's just the marketing that would need to improve.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 04:21:20'] Just to add some data here, there appears to be a bunch of calls at 260 strike which infers that any hedging momentum would tap out around there. For whatever reason a lot of those calls expire this Friday 6/26 and had large volume during the last session. People seem to keep reloading weekly call options here ever since earnings 6/5. IMO it helps drag the stock higher.There are also a fair amount of deep in the money calls on this now and I would assume dealers are short these calls, so as the stock goes up they have to buy. Of course, it works the opposite on the way down...but stock has to change trend first.[Chart](https://spotgamma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ZM-1.png)

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 09:06:51'] Long story short, option sellers are usually bigger fish and option buyers are usually smaller retail players like myself and my robinhood buds. That is also why option buyers lose >90% of the time. Think of it as insurance, would insurance companies be in business if insurers didnt make money most of the time. So, if insurers are happy to write more puts i.e. endure more pain when the stock tanks, it is more than likely not going to happen. Max pain in a gist suggests that stocks usually settle at the point of max pain to option buyers i.e. where most contracts would expire out of the money.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-20 16:10:24'] This might be a dangerous play, yeah I think ZM is super over valued but Florida has gone from 800 cases a day to 4000. The possibility of more shutdowns exists- so they may do better than people thing, but yeah at the moment theyre certainly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 06:26:51'] If you’re going to post an analysis on something as closely followed as ZM, you oughta do a bit more research and idea development. Dozens have had the same thought process you laid out just to try and fail to short ZM.Is ZM overvalued at current levels? Yes. Is it due for a sharp correction? Maybe, but I doubt it. Trading at such a high P/E is not surprising for what people see as a huge GROWTH opportunity (and dirty hedge against market turbulence resulting from COVID news). The market is forward looking in nature. ZM has developed incredible name value and staying power, even with competitors vying for market share. Even post-COVID, WFH and remote work are new norms.Let’s talk about how literally EVERYTHING is overvalued.

It’s overvalued. It’s bc of covid-19. No. It’s earnings growth rate isn’t zero. It’s quadrupling earnings revenue growth and  still flying high. Point is I lost a few minutes of my life bc of that video & I wasn’t very entertained nor was I very educated. 🤦🏻‍♂️In the times of covid if you can’t do either or then you’re ... fk idk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 16:20:27'] These are all just opinions including some of the comments.Purely from a strategic perspective, the streaming world is not a zero sum game. Any user might have some combination of Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney+, Apple TV+, Hulu+ etc.All that Netflix needs to do is create enough attractive content to retain its customers who are already sticky and susbcribers. You and some of the folks here are grossly underestimating the value of stickiness in this business. And FOMO. Some cool new original show drops that everyone’s talking about.. what happens then? It would cause people who left to come back. And then, they stay for another year before losing interest.Either way, I’m bullish on Netflix, Disney as they have sufficient moats in this business.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 18:45:58'] How in the world in your job paying for your Netflix subscription?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 15:36:36'] I’m conflicted.I agree with your assessment of their declining content quality. Also, I think a big part of what made Netflix so great before was the algorithm they used to make suggestions based on your ratings, I don’t know what they changed or when they did it but it seems like it might coincide with when they switched from the star-based ratings to a simple thumbs up/down rating.Their pricing is very inflated for the experience IMO and I have seriously considered just cancelling it altogether lately. Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable. Hulu is cheaper but their commercials playing at like 130% of the volume of the shows is super annoying.Anyway, I remember when Netflix recently announced their most recent subscription price increase that their stock responded very positively. I’d be willing to bet the majority of their investors underestimated the competition and overestimated the quality of Netflix during that stock price rise. Unless something big changes I think they’ll start to see subscription rates dip quite substantially, eventually into a net loss of subscribers.BUT! I don’t want to underestimate the sticky effect of longtime subscription holders just taking a super long time to wake up and drop the service—I still remember hearing stories of people renting their landline telephones from AT&T or one of the Bell companies (can’t remember atm) for decades as recently as the late ‘90s or ‘00s just because they’d never looked at their bill and didn’t know they had other options—they were simply too used to the monthly bill to even consider other options. Granted, we live in a new age but people tend to be creatures of habit and I’m not sure what sort of timeline this “awakening” would require.Good post, thank you, definitely going to watch them more closely now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 16:35:56'] When I heard Disney was coming out with a streaming service, and were pulling there original content from Netflix, I immediately became Bearish on Netflix. Netflix is a bubble at the moment in my opinion. Sure, brand loyalty and "sticking with what you got" are strong points for the Bull argument, but I don't think Millennials, and there soon to be kids care that much about those things as the previous generation does. They are at the moment a 1 trick pony in comparison to these other giants as was previously stated.I am with the OP. If I had the funds I would BUY puts against Netflix 2+ years in thr future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 16:22:31'] Amazon maybe but Apple get revenue from data collection? what’s your source?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 20:21:59'] You can say what you want about the quality of Netflix, but they have a base of 200M users, and they're ramping up their international expansion. Even if US business loses market share to Disney, etc, they will be fine, because they compete in every market in the world, while the other streamers do not.And if their growth slows down and they need to monetize, they can charge more and cull freeloaders on accounts. The stock may not be a stellar investment right now, but I would not bet against Netflix.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 21:28:11'] If Netflix's biggest downfall is that it is overpriced for what it is, and there is better competition available, then there is also an argument to be made that Netflix could get bought out by a larger entity or merge with one of it's other competitors. 2 years is a long ways to go, anything could happen.  Wasn't Tiger King the most watched show during the pandemic last year?  They have plenty of their own noteworthy proprietary content that HBO, Apple, or Amazon would love to get their hands on.  I don't think Netflix is going to go bankrupt or disappear anytime soon.  Taking a bear position is a risky play during a bull market imo.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 19:15:42'] Being bearish on Netflix is probably correct but I doubt puts are gonna lead to profits. It'll be a long slow road lower. With puts time limitations and upfront costs it's not a food play.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 17:49:31'] I’m out. Don’t undervalue the brand. They have made changes to their business model in the past and can continue to do so as necessary. Show me some sign of losing ground first then I’ll think about going short.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 21:28:57'] Nobody here is talking about kids' content. Although we have Disney+, Prime and YouTube Premium, my young daughters binge the content on Netflix the most. They seem more Netflix generation than Disney one.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 00:58:08'] Disney+ doesn’t make money. Peacock doesn’t. Hulu didn’t. Amazon prime I do not know profit. This is probably the biggest threat because amazon has so much cash it can buy whatever it wants. The problem with amazon prime is that content is FILLED with old garbage. So much absolute dog shit. My guess is that the spin-off streamers consolidate back after burning cash for 5yr or so. Netflix and 2 others reign supreme. Netflix is the default. Tons of good content. Netflix kids is gold. Disney plus for kids is good as well. YouTube premium is actually probably the best.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 01:28:08'] No shortage of opinions on competition amongst the various players in the streaming space, but I suspect the momentum will continue to be positive across the board as the "cord cutting" movement goes exponential.  The domino effect of the shift in how we access content has obviously gained steam - and brought Netflix a lot of competition - but I suspect we still have a ways to go as the shift in business model puts the final nails in the coffin for traditional cable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 01:49:33'] I really like netflix, lots of good content in there
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 05:40:57']  Netflix is the best streaming service with the best interface and original content. This is like betting against Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 05:41:09'] I wouldn’t... it’s still a growing industry, they are producing their own content , they have the most recognizable brand in the streaming space. It takes one merger/ acquisition and this play is tucked. The business model is scalable, revenues growing - Unless this “tech bubble” pops I don’t see this a strong play but you do you and diamond hand that shit💎👏
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 05:46:49'] Buying DOOM puts in any insane-value tech name is the correct play - just don’t pay the ask price in most cases. BTW, DOOM = Deep Out Of the Money. So for example, $WIX is traded at $330 and I think that it’s realistic value is around $50, so I am looking for cheap 120 puts for June/July. I think that this is the best play in today’s market given the huge risk in shorting.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 08:12:50'] Before you bet against NetFlix remember the NFL season is over and there is nothing IMO on TV worth my time until next September so if I watch anything it is going to be commercial free and most likely a series on NetFlix. If you choose to bet against them don't go all in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 09:26:38'] If price is a concern, what about a put debit spread? Reduce your cost of entry to the position but cap your potential gains? I tend to do this with speculative guessing so I feel better if my hypothesis does come true. That's just me though, I'm fine risking a debit for something like this if I believe strongly in it. Much to others points though, Netflix just has to barely play their cards right and they will still be fine (imo). I haven't done any DD on the company and have no stake so I certainly can't speculate on price though I similarly share your same view position about them. I've been burned trading based on my beliefs though. Believe me, I ask myself every day how SnapChat is still going up. Again no DD there but it doesn't make sense to me. I don't like their platform, their content offering, I assume everyone is in the same boat as me about even their stories being worthless for IG stories, yet I would have lost a lot of money betting against them. Maybe Netflix's future success seems improbable to you now, but improbable events occur everyday. In summary after rambling, maybe start digging into Netflix and try to find something that confirms your bearish position on them. If you can see it for yourself with your own eyes, you wouldn't hesitate to play the hand. If you still want some skin in the game, consider a put debit spread.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 10:15:53'] GANG of FAANG driving the market! No matter what folks think. You can’t fight the market you just move with the flow not against it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 11:41:27'] Netflix is in a place where at one side there is a lot of competition on pricing power and on the other side they need to produce their own content which increases cost per user. They would be investing in cheaper international content to keep their international user base growing. Probably that strategy will work in terms of their revenue, but don’t see their profit margins increasing. As a US consumer I feel cheated though, one of the most expensive subscription with decreasing content quality. Moreover if I hear about a good series, I just buy a subscription for a month watch the series and move on. Business has become more cyclical in nature with so much competition around.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 14:27:37'] Be careful shorting anything in this current environment. Everything seems to rise. You can do short term puts but don't take too long of a view. As soon as it falls, it gets pushed back up again. Usually pretty quickly. Best of luck
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 14:30:25'] To get a similar result and have the option premium work for you, you can sell a call out of the money. Just tread gently and either have some kind of delta protection or have very rigid disciplined stops.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 21:37:24'] Wholeheartedly disagree.Netflix is about to be cash flow positive and quickly becoming the largest media production studio in the business with huge actors like Leo, Ryan Reynolds, and Jason Mamoa.I called this a year ago. I said Netflix will become a production studio first, and a distribution platform second. So far I’m looking right.Just look at their 2021 content schedule.They make more $ per user than any other streaming service and continue to grow their user base even as they raise prices.They will be a $1,000 stock a year from now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 19:10:24'] Imo Netflix has a bit of a moat - part intentional, part by accident. Keep in mind that they knew pretty early there would be competition - they started by taking down the Goliath we knew as Blockbuster. Now, what sets them apart? Well, first is the emphasis on original content you specifically can't get elsewhere (Disney+ wants movies in theatres ultimately, HBO max will just be on demand HBO content, etc. - there will always be alternatives for most of the other platforms' content). That is the accident.What is intentional? If you look at their content curation it is actually brilliant for two philosophies they live by:1) the focus is on keeping you from looking for something - the material doesn't need to be great, it just needs to be good enough. And in fact, it almost does this better when it's not super compelling because something that is A+ content requires heavy focus and not something you'll put on regularly for 3-4 hours. 2) They let the creatives make the material, and they focus on providing a medium for it. They offer comedians deals for stand up specials that they produce, they work out deals with YouTube channels (and usually let them stream it on their end too which doubles as advertising, and they ask famous directors to make a movie exclusively for Netflix. They provide resources to content creators with built in audiences. Want to watch any of the new Chapelle specials? You better get a Netflix subscription. Netflix is trying to be for streaming what Budweiser is for beer. They are fostering a lifestyle. The desire is to be the case of beer you buy to share with the boys, not the drink you have on special occassion. Marc Randolph, one of the original creators does an amazing interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast if you want to learn more about the inner workings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 20:19:29'] I wish you luck but I really don’t agree. Netflix is in a LOT of countries not just America.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 07:21:56'] Wheel stocks that you want to own long term. The wheel and strangles are all good for accentuating gains on an underlying that you are ultimately bullish on. There are only two ways to get burned: either you make money but not as much as people who bought and held, or your CSP gets assigned and the stock plummets. The first sucks but it isn’t the end of the world, the second is how you detonate your account. Importantly, you are more likely to end up bag holding when you chase IV and the highest premiums on over valued stocks. Which is why I don’t dabble in, say $TSLA.Also, that being said it’s hard to know what to suggest without knowing what stock price range you are looking at. I see lots of people here recommending $TSLA but that means you are selling puts that obligate you for a 90k purchase (if you take assignment; don’t roll out etc.) I see from your post history that you’ve dabbled in TSLA options before, so maybe that’s your preferred space. Personally, I prefer to sell multiple contracts on stocks under $100. $10-50 can be an interesting range to be in too.

	COMMENT: ['2016-10-24 21:25:43'] An iron condor seems like a good fit. Skew it slightly to fit your bias. If I had your opinion, I'd look to sell the options at 8% movement or so, and maybe buy the wings $20 wider. Not gonna make a fortune on this, but it is high probability, limited risk. Albeit the risk is likely many multiples of the premium collected.Want more juice? You'll have to fly closer to the sun by selling closer in strikes on the condor, maybe 5% out? This decreases the odds of profit, but the profit will be bigger if you do win. I suggest $20 to $25 wide if the account can handle that risk. If not AMZN may not be the best stock to be trading in front of earnings. $20 can be a sneeze in AMZN.

POST_TEXT: b'The highest-voted post of today was a post saying that Zoom is overvalued, linking to a "stock analysis". I was underwhelmed, so I suggest a counter-analysis.\n\n**Debunking the previous "analysis"**\n\nBasically, the only arguments were that: the earnings per share and the revenue per share are low. Both of which are usually irrelevant for an early stage company with a high potential for growth.\n\nThe earning per share are completely useless for such a company:\n\n* Amazon had very low profit, or had losses for a large part of their history (so P/E ratio was >500 for 3 years, with a quarter at 3,600 and 7 quarters at infinity P/E ratio, [source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio)).

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 06:34:38'] The difference between all the companies you mentioned with infinite PE is that they were trailblazers in their respective industries and expanded to other product lines after seeing tremendous growth in their core business.Zoom has seen tremendous growth due to Covid in a compressed time-frame and have struggled with that growth due to server issues and privacy concerns.Concurrently, you have 2 large competitors ( Microsoft and Google) that will easily grab market share since Teams and Hangout are integrated with their clients existing product suite. Same with Webex through Cisco, a favorite in corporate setting. That is a significant headwind for Zoom.On the consumer side, which isn't a money maker for Zoom, Facebook will definitely grab market share for the same reason, integration within social media.I think Zoom offers a slim product offering relative to its valuation and will only lose market share and revenue unless they can parlay to another product.Puts for me.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 05:19:03'] People seem to be missing the incredible value of a post like this.  Instead of being told WHAT to think (like we are so conditioned to do with instant gratification on the interwebs), OP is telling us HOW he thinks.  Well done.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 04:41:03'] I love these kinds of counter posts. We don't all have to agree, in fact to be more profitable we should all be looking for counterpoints to our theses to avoid confirmation bias.If I make an in-depth analysis post, I always invite people to tear it apart so I can see the other side.Great post!
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 07:18:26'] I’m going to lay this out here:Teams will be integrated with Outlook by the end of next year. As in, they will be the same application. If you use Office, Teams will be included as part of the package.Beyond that, Zoom is not special. BlueJeans, Webex, Skype and half a dozen other products do the same thing to varying degrees at different price points.I don’t make a lot of predictions, but I will make this one: Zoom will be a legacy product within 5 years, unless it lives on as part of a Microsoft competitor’s productivity suite. Only Amazon or Google can save them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 05:47:53'] The only question I have is “has zoom reached its revenue ceiling?” It is possible that they cannot grow anymore. Really covid 19 was the best thing ever for them. Also their moat is narrow. Skype and google video is also out there. Zoom needs to be innovative... and right now, besides their single product, I’m not sure what else they have in store. I struggle to see them growing any further. I also don’t think their revenues go down much unless they increase prices but eventually with one product, you hit a revenue ceiling with no innovations.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 06:25:21'] Honestly, I do not understand the value of their offering. They have so many competitors that have the mean to catch up to whatever they do different, but without the shown lack of concerns for security. For what it's worth,  we actually have a company-wide policy against Zoom. We just can't risk defaulting in our privacy contracts because of sketchy software.But that's just my 2c.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 08:29:41'] Thanks for the write up, great read. I too have fallen into the bear argument of “a video meeting service has a PE of 10x that of Amazon”. That said their Covid revenue bump will propel them into 2021 with strength but I do believe this has or will plateau very soon. We are definitely past the period of exponential user growth and they still are not sharing how many of those are the free 40 minute licenses. They shocked the market and their name has become commonplace but at the end of the day I don’t see any competitive advantage that allows them to protect their market share medium to long term. So many companies are already fully integrated with Microsoft cloud suite that it only makes sense that they will eventually offer a better version of Teams with attractive pricing to compete/undercut. Their product is solid no doubt but when it becomes a question of budget I don’t see much brand loyalty personally speaking. So the play imo, long dated puts are way too expensive and it probably isn’t moving anytime soon. I’ve had some success selling call spreads against it. Last week 280/290 calls ~30dte were fetching between $2.50-3.00 credit. That said I also have some 240/250 spreads that are currently ITM. Really looking for that pullback...any day now 😐
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 02:57:10'] What happens when covid goes away?  This is a bet on covids work from home dynamic, and a bet that they have something so proprietary that no one could catch up.  High growth stocks indeed run up revenue early, but I believe their run up is shorter than most growth stories.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 07:19:40'] I think you're correct that ZM's valuation depends on if Microsoft Teams takes significant market share or not. That's hard to predict, but I think it would make sense for Microsoft to try. Not sure how that would translate to options plays without news though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 07:39:08'] The problem with your assumptions is that you assume Zoom is the only video conferencing app.There is no barrier to entry for zoom and a lot of the enterprise software providers have competitors that could overtake them especially if it integrates better with existing suites. I expect Microsoft in particular will dramatically improve their conferencing.Zoom has no plans for expansion outside of the video conferencing arena, which is a huge mistake. The best hope for their current valuation is that they get bought out.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 11:32:56'] ZM is wildly overvalued on every metric. Everything you said is worthless after “I’m not an actual analyst”
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 13:42:30'] Amazon sold things cheaper than anyone else, and all the other companies did something unique.  What does Zoom actually do?  It is video chat, right?  So what's so special about it compared to Skype/MS teams/whatever?  Do they actually do anything unique, or is it just the famous name that the pandemic gave us?  No, I never used Zoom because video conferencing has been around for 15 years now and I don't see why I should try Zoom now.  It seems like the chat programs; they get hot for a little while, and then disappear into the abyss.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 07:05:23'] The biggest concern with Zoom along with many other Tech companies is being phased out by the big already established companies.  Video conferencing is extremely competitive and Zoom doesn’t provide enough of a moat to say it’s a clear winner over the other options
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 08:00:03'] I like your thought process but using Amazon as a comparison is worthless data point imo.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 11:00:13'] It's a well written. But op has made numerous assumptions to support his theory and have made comparison with such stories from different companies. Anytime I analyse or read a analysis I always look at the negatives that are written. But op only has glowing things to say even the rosiest companies have many things that could go wrong. So when someone doesn't mention any negatives I am skeptical of their interest either be this post or the other one calling for  puts. Zm is not as rosy as it is portaied may be it will be but the core business it is having is not in any way a most for them as it's easily replicate by competition and already have done and in works. So to assume it will have competitive advantage over time from big starlwarts and continue the kind of growth Isa futile assumption. It's market share is most likely will be eaten away by other players so the next big thing is diversification that they will have to do to be competitive.unless we see that happening the valuation is going to be questionable.Biggest factor op missed is zm got this kind of valuation only because of covid ..if the business was rosy before it would have demanded atleadt relative premium before covid but it did not. That is the whole point of counter argument.Disclosure no position in ZM

To understand this stock’s potential, look at Zoom’s corporate client list and see that it’s a whose who of the Fortune 500. you have to realize that the major technology companies have had this available for over a decade and have been unable to monetize it. Now Zoom is capturing corporate sponsorship and becoming the de facto professional video technology a la Microsoft was to corporate computing systems. Zoom isn’t going away. In one month they went from a virtual nobody to a candidate for joining Webster’s dictionary. “I’m going to zoom *Grandma* “Cost of sales will increase marginally and revenue growth will slow down.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 10:57:07'] Profit estimates are unbelievably optimistic for what is just another conferencing app in a crowded space. There is nothing ground breaking about Zoom other than you don't need an account to use it. Is it a good product? Absolutely. So are five others. Tens of millions of people paying for video conferencing? Why? You can use Meet if your company also has a Google Business subscription. You can use Microsoft's apps the same way. Now, can the stock price go higher in this environment of "stocks only go up"? Sure, and if that's how you define that a company "makes a killing", then buy call options. Just remember that any analysis like this is irrelevant in the context of value investing since this company operates in a crowded space and does nothing to advance it on top of earning a few cents a share. From a speculative point of view you don't even need an analysis to justify gambling just like you don't weigh your odds before playing blackjack, you're going to do it anyway.

Can anyone clarify? I'm not new to options but I cannot tell what OP is describing in terms of options strategy. Sounds to be directionally neutral but requiring a large move which a long ATM LEAP Straddle would do. But then there is nothing OTM about that.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-21 16:23:19'] I hate how Amazon is used as an excuse for any stock being over valued. Amazon's value to me has changed very little in the past five years, and their most profitable offering is a commodity (web hosting) with diminishing margins as most companies adopt cloud agnostic solutions.There's no thesis that justifies the valuation of such a rinky dink operation. It's more than Tesla was before it surged. IMO Zoom's advertising strategy was to get established social media accounts to verb "Zoom". Given their large marketing budget have you actually seen any ads? That's what I thought. Somehow this shit worked. Sickening.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 07:46:26'] For the assumption about market growth you need to look at Teams, Webex, Skype for Business and Meet as these tend to be corporate staples. If zoom can pull accounts from underneath these, it's going to hit above your projected desired numbers. Fyi every company has a conferencing subscription even if not working remotely, you always need to deal with people not within your reach.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 15:36:06'] If your goal is to not sell, then take a smaller premium. But also, if you wheel, then take the bigger premium and don’t worry about getting assigned. Switch to puts once you do.I’ve been doing my first wheel and deliberately sold my calls a bit more OTM because a dividend was in play, but now that I’m past it, I’m probably going with a closer to ATM call to grab more premium.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 14:49:45'] Why are you considering buying back the call option?That is anthetical to the entire theory behind writing call options against your position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 19:49:38'] How volatile is the underlying?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 05:18:51'] It also matters what your capital gains strategy is. If you’re short term then you could probably take higher risk for more premium. If your goal is long term, then low risk low premium or don’t trade CCs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 06:27:50'] If you don’t want to lose your shares for a long period of time, you can also buy and sell calls and puts with different strikes and expirations. There are a lot of different trading strategies you could use depending on the underlying and your goals. Tastytrade is a good place to start if you’re not familiar.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 11:30:30'] If you're not looking to ditch the underlying, you have a few options (pun intended):  Sell puts going into the position to start collecting premium on them, so if you do get assigned, you're a better price point for it. But only sell enough puts that make up a partial position that you would go in on. From there, strangle the position with puts on one side and calls on the other, collecting additional premiums to continue to beat up the cost basis. Along the way you may have to add to the position or sell some away. But if you plan to hold long term, you're okay doing both. Weeklies are attractive, but there's good money to be made in 30-60 DTE options. I would start there. There's more wiggle room and opportunity to manage any trades that go against you in the time frame as well.

It works out okay if you are methodical, set good levels, have the time and attention to commit if you're close to your limit, and we aren't in a massively volatile market. I'm leaning option 1 for now. Thanks to the back-testing feature on ToS, I was able to test doing exactly what you describe in option 2, as I am interested in developing a similar strategy. I chose TQQQ as the underlying asset, sold weeklys that were between 6 and 8 percent OTM (I tested 6 and 7 percent OTM), and bought the contract back the instant the share price reached 99.9% of the strike price. It's a little time-intensive, so I have only completed the following results: * 6% OTM weeklys, June-August: $4.92 in premiums earned, $3.62 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 4 of 13 times, net $1.30 profit* 7% OTM weeklys, June-August: $3.77 in premiums earned, $0.78 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 2/13 times, net $2.99 profit* 7% OTM weeklys, Sep-present: $5.54 in premiums earned, $5.47 in premiums paid, assigned 3 of the last four weeks, net $0.07 in profit, heading into a terrifying week to close out the quarter. There's potential, but it seems like a lot of work and requires lots of attention and firm rule-setting for if/when to buy back, and if you aren't able to hawkishly devote attention when it gets close, you either make decisions that deviate from your plan, or you snooze for a few minutes and suddenly the rebuy is at a much larger loss than you intended, forcing you to choose between getting assigned and eating a much larger loss than necessary at a volatile and sensitive point in the process.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-28 08:25:20'] Higher premiums imply a higher probability of being assigned.It sounds like you should consider a qualified covered call (https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls) at or above a price you are willing to sell the shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 09:21:05'] I was watching VIAC before the dip, and I'm currently in about 45/share after the fall. Take it from me shares are probably better, but LEAPS are okay. I've seen a lot of people get burned by options with VIAC/DISCA/etc. recently so be conservative with these.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 09:20:17'] I think it's a bad play. Viacom for the past decade has been quiet and stable in it's slow decline. Certainly it had some madness that apparently drove it to almost 100 but the model itself from an investor standpoint isn't becoming more and more profitable. In fact if it were I wouldn't imagine they would have needed to issue more shares to begin with.

They can license to others, but that only makes sense as long as their content is good enough to be relevant and the slow death of cable is going to continue to starve them of the resources they need to refresh their content.  As soon as that happens, the big streaming players aren't going to pay a premium for their content when they can invest in their own.It only makes sense as a takeover target.  Maybe that makes sense at $40.  It certainly didn't at $100.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 17:41:10'] Been doing it for 2 years now. Watch Markus Heitkoetter in YouTube, easy to understand. Just keep in mind that main key for PMCC is management.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 19:56:25'] They're awesome.From my options guide:* Diagonal Spreads: PMCC / PMCPPMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).  They are nicknames for diagonal options, often used with longer term options or LEAPS.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.These are very powerful; I’m using them more and more often to replace “non-explosive” growth calls and long term plays.An experienced E-Trade instructor calls PMCCs “renting stock”, which I wholeheartedly agree with.  Being able to sell CCs without locking down large amounts of capital, to cover the cost of 100 shares or taking the high-risk of selling calls naked, is awesome.For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting "blown by" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAPS deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.Like most spreads selling a CC will cap your near term profits, typically providing max profit (or loss) near the CC expiry.The diagonal CC you sell will modify your positions overall greeks, specifically delta and theta.  The delta reduction will lead to slower gains (until the CC expires).  The theta from the solid CC will be positive.  If you set up your CCs right, you can I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  These are my parameters that I’m testing, use at your own risk.Long call DTE at least 6 months, preferably ~1 year+ LEAPS.   14-20 or 30-45 DTE calls on my CC..7-.9 delta long leg.Kamikaze cash recommends a .4 to .5 delta difference between the long and short legs, which I agree with to prevent “blowout” if the price spikes and the short CC delta ramps up drastically.  I try not to go below .3 delta difference.The goal is to hold the LEAPS long term, potentially until expiration (or 3-6 months before when theta starts getting noticeable), and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAPS anymore.E-Trade recommends you pay less than the width of your strikes, which I think is smart. Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my LEAPS cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook/excel sheet I write each CC on my $NIO LEAPS (I Meme stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.  When I originally wrote this I had ~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAPS has.TT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.  You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAPS value.  I look at them more as a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/diagonal-spreads-time-decay-08132020Kamikaze Cash: https://youtu.be/Q8A0WXbXXgATasty Trade PMCC videos:https://youtu.be/JDQrc3qpRTIhttps://youtu.be/Mq_Y8RRSCA8https://youtu.be/jQ6oSawgRvM
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 13:14:44'] Yes, it’s my go to strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 13:49:19'] Yea that's my primary play with options. I'm not convinced you can make decent returns just selling premium alone, so I always combine some long delta positions. Diagonal spreads are perfect for that.It can benefit to leg into them if you buy the long side of the spread at low IV, but of course there is the whole "timing the market" blah blah.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 14:53:51'] Stock or index selection is key - leverage works both ways so if the underlying falls, the PMCC is going to amplify that loss. I’ve wiped out a lot of gains on a handful of untimely and probably ill advised selections. May want to start out with index ETFs. I’m running XLE and XLF right now and have been doing pretty well with them for the past 6 months. They are fairly low cost too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 14:55:48'] Yes, PMCC is a great strategy. The biggest problem in this raging bull market is having your short call challenged. Look at a chart and think how high the stock could rise, then sell your short call 2-3 strikes above that. I can't tell you how many .30 delta short calls I've been stuck rolling up and out over the past year trying to get out from under them.I'd be selling .15 or .10 delta calls only in this market. Also, when everything is trending up, just hold on to the long call and wait for things to taper off a bit before selling the short calls again. That comment about selling a .40 short call on a PMCC I think is nuts in this market. You'll get trampled by the bull market. Go much higher on the short strike.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 21:04:58'] Love the credit call spread idea. Okay it nets "only" 15%, but it seems like the most risk controlled way of achieving a bearish position in this crazy bull market.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 19:59:10'] The current price is, to blunt, fucking insane. Unless you can sell calls, I don't see how buying anything but puts would make sense if you are speculating.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 02:56:10'] Restaurant owner.  Ubereats are offering us basically 0% commission right now.  We've servers that want to do delivery - they're seeing the amount that DD et al. take from the customer and thinking they'd like a bit of that.Plus we all remember when DoorDash added us to their list of restaurants without asking, placed to-go orders which sat around in the window for an hour because they hadn't got their delivery figured out, got delivered to the customer cold and old at 50% more than it'd have cost the customer to get it direct from us and led to us getting reputational damage.So they've shafted their suppliers (us), their workers (kept their tips), gouged their customers and are in a race to the bottom on price.  Think I'll load up on calls ;-)
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 03:02:52'] I think there’s a near-term bullish case that needs to be considered seriously. First: I agree DASH is overvalued. Let’s not argue that. What I think needs discussion is whether valuation (or value) is an accurate representation of stock pricing—and, by extension, options pricing—over the next year or so. The current configuration of stimulus payments incentivizes gambling. A modest one-time check can’t go very far. Sure, you can pay your rent with it, but then you’re stuck next month, when there is no more stimulus money. So maybe you buy some nice sneakers instead, because those will last at least a year. Maybe you eat very well for a few days. Maybe you buy a new iPhone. These are all things people are thinking about with their stimulus money... and, at some point, some people will think, “what if I turn this $1200 into $10,000?”The rationale here is simple. The $1200 can’t do much more than buy a few things; however, it represents a zero-risk gamble with a high potential payoff. So, it makes sense people will plow money into high-risk investments—because to them, these are “zero-risk, high-reward” investments. One such investment is Doordash stock. Narrative economics. Nobel laureate Robert Shiller has done quite a bit of research into the stories people tell and how they affect stock prices. Today, these narratives take the form of memes, and in the case of Doordash, meme stocks. This “narrative economic effect” cannot be understated, since it can not only drive stock prices, but can also drive intangible or goodwill value in the balance sheet. Moreover, we are in a period where news information is transmitted over social media, and social media is biased according to personal preferences. This means it’s entirely possible a sub population of investors receive skewed financial information about stocks like Doordash, because it’s more likely to be consumed (and not because it’s entirely accurate).So, in December 2020, we have a possible stimulus check being issued to Americans. Similarly, there may be one or more stimulus packages in the first half of 2021, to combat rising poverty in the US. Maybe another stimulus in the second half of 2021 to get the economy going while vaccinations gain traction and hospitalizations go way down.With looming lockdowns and logistical challenges to delivering vaccines far and wide, it’s possible DASH squeezes out profits for a couple of quarters. That can solidify its nascent meme status over at wallstreetbets.And what if they issue more shares to create a substantial cash reserve at the current stock price? I know it seems improbable, but the theme of 2020 is that improbable things happen. It doesn’t make sense for DASH to rise in value, but it’s a real possibility it does exactly that. We are in a period of irrationality, and there is no certainty as to when it will end. .
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 23:10:18'] I agree on the bearish case. I see no competitive advantage between DASH and the other 10 for delivery apps that do the same thing
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 10:20:24'] I like how DASH goes up ~7% the day after this get's posted lol

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 08:14:46'] I like this guy's thought process, but playing these options are way above my weight class.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 13:36:20'] The spreads don't make any sense because of the extremely low volume. You'd get rekt by the bid-ask spread

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 22:59:22'] Diagonals are best when the underlying is in backwardation. I can't think of a reason why there would be a good bullish case other than general market stupidity, at least in the long term. With the Fed printing money and "providing liquidity" (aka buying stocks to prop up the price), I do not see this trend lasting, especially when the big boys decide to start taking profits.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 05:39:16'] my anecdotal response has only 2 points. I didn't see you factor in dashpass, which is a monthly recurring fee - which they may potentially take a loss on, I'm not sure. For me, doordash prices have consistently been cheaper than grubhub when i price out a delivery.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:20:18'] Excellent write up, but I think you glossed over the brand loyalty part a bit too quickly.  Sure I have brand loyalty to a restaurant when they are providing everything, but when they are just the food suddenly the familiarity with the ordering process becomes far more valuable.I have tried so many new restaurants this year because of DoorDash and because “why not?”  People are finding ways to branch out without leaving the house and DoorDash is at the forefront of that movement which isn’t going away completely in a post-COVID world.Sure there is likely to be a period of weakness for DASH in the coming months but I think they have the lead in an important space for the next decade. This market is pretty obviously forward looking right now, so don’t go too nuts on the bearish plays IMHO.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 13:28:37'] Hey, dasher here (I also drive for uber eats). The claim that dashers make less than $2 an hour is absolute horseshit. From the Salon (lmao) article you linked:>What it boils down to is that DoorDash has created a pay model in which workers appear to be making a decent wage on paper, but which, after expenses, is barely more than $0. Worse, only 11 percent of DoorDash jobs paid above the U.S.'s laughable federal minimum wage.Does this not smell like bullshit on the surface? $0/hour? Are you fucking kidding me. I typically drive for DD and Ubereats simultaneously. I take the best orders I get (usually if it looks like they left a decent tip) by calculating whether the order makes slightly more than min wage (in los angeles that is $15/hour). For example: If I get an order for $5 and it takes 15 mins to complete, I'll take it. If I get a $3 order that takes 20 mins to complete I'll laugh and decline it.Mornings I get anywhere between $13-20 an hour (most of which is starbucks and mcdonalds. Also keep in mind starbucks has a special deal with Ubereats and now postmates so doordash is left out of those lucrative morning deliveries). Evenings its anywhere between  $15-$30 an hour. Just last Sunday I made $90 in 3 hours of driving. I know what you may be thinking "but what about your taxes and gas?". Independent contractor tax is 30%. Pretty steep I know. But that doesn't factor in major mileage deductions. I track all the miles I drive and use an app to see how much I save. $0.57 tax deduction per mile. In the end I am paying about 15% in taxes.I know this doesn't have much to do with the point of your post but I thought I would set the record straight because I know a lot of people will read that "less than $2/hour" thing and be confused.Also fyi to people that order ubereats/doordash. Us delivery drivers can see how much we are going to make on your delivery when it is offered to us. Don't expect your food to arrive warm if you don't leave a tip when ordering. I personally ignore orders with no tip, and I hope other drivers do too.

POST_TEXT: b"On Monday the private jet company, Wheels Up, will be going public via a Spac merger with ASPL and the ticker will be changing to UP.\n\n**Basic Info**\n\nSince 2013, Wheels Up has led the private aviation industry by offering customers a great experience from the moment they leave their house until they arrive at their destination. Revolutionizing the industry, they launched a membership model that offers a variety of packages to suit each client's needs.\n\n**Investors**\n\nDelta Airlines recently acquired a 25% stake in Wheels Up looking to offer customers an option to fly into smaller airports and greatly reduce travel time (eg. security, baggage, delays, etc). By having partnerships with Porsche, American Express, and Waldorf Astoria, Wheels Up is looking to provide an unparalleled traveling experience for the wealthy by having access to luxury rental cars, fancy hotel deals, and the convenience of flying to local airports.\n\nThis business model has proven to be very lucrative as in 2020, "

I sold them this morning (now UP Aug 20th 12.50 calls) just after the market opened for $0.90. for a $2,750 profit. I could have sold them a little higher if I'd acted quicker, but I'm happy with the trade. I do like the company, and I'll be watching closely... I may buy it back after the inevitable post deSPAC dip.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nIt has been a fine day in the stock market, and I've noticed across reddit, stocktwits, and twitter, that there seems to be a bit of confusion surrounding what a gamma squeeze is.\n\nLet's clear that up right now.\n\nTo understand a gamma squeeze, a bit of options trading knowledge is required. A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of stock at a given price, called the strike price, within a given amount of time.\n\nWhen an options trader or investor buys a call option, someone needs to be on the other side of the transaction and be willing to sell them the 100 shares. This other party is usually a market maker  traders who work for an exchange, bank or company and are mainly looking for small steady profits rather than accumulating a massive speculative bet (although they may do this as well).\n\nWhen many people buy call options from a market maker, the market maker is effectively taking on a large short position in the stock. If the price of the stock rises, they face large losse"

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 07:47:33'] You're buying all these options? More of a ratio spread then a strangle. If you're expecting a downside move, might be cheaper to skew a strangle to the downside. If you truly think there's going to be a giant correction maybe even sell a call to fund the puts. Could still cap the naked risk on the call side too with a cheap far out wing. Depends on your risk tolerance I suppose.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-28 22:54:40'] Thanks for making this video.  Having never traded options, I learned a lot.  Especially appreciated your “light on the lingo” approach.  I’ll add my thoughts as an outsider.As is generally the case in options discussions, I didn’t see anything addressing what I see as the central question: correctly identifying mispricings.  There is a relationship between the underlying and it’s various derivatives.  If the market is getting that relationship wrong, there will generally be some a trading strategy that one can apply to it that generates alpha.  That’s a big If, though.For instance, I believe you stated that IV generally goes down after earnings calls.  There should be a way to exploit this, *unless* the market already priced in that tendency.  My hypothesis would be that if you graphed the current prices of the same option, purchased right now, over the series of available expiration dates you might choose, you would see a kink in the curve at the earnings call date.I believe the market is right most of the time.  I’m interested in seeing a step by step process by which skilled traders come to the conclusion that, “This situation is an exception to the rule; I’m right on this and the market is wrong.”  As far as I can tell, this part is the only reason to bother with trading at all, yet it rarely gets addressed or even noticed!Or if my premise is wrong on any of the above, I’m all ears.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 09:24:09'] I have a simple off topic question. I'm kinda new to trading in general. And especially to options. So, I hope that you can help me out. If you have calls that are far out of the money, like Apple is currently trading at $286.91, and I would short a call option with strike price $320, and an expiration date of May 1. I don't expect Apple to increase 11.5% in the following 2 days. What could go wrong here if I hold this till the expiration date? What am I missing here?
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 12:13:07'] Hey, I'm the guy from the livestream who was asking that question about expected values.First of all, thanks for taking time out of your day to share your knowledge with us! It really means a lot to people like me who are just getting started. I'm fairly new to this, so forgive me if what I'm trying to ask is confusing. My question was trying to get at how it's possible to even make money trading options, from a theoretical standpoint.My understanding is that options essentially price risk vs return. So even if a trade, let’s say a credit spread, has a higher probability of profit because it is more out of the money, then you will receive a lower premium on it. I remember reading about this here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected\_value\_and\_high\_vs\_low\_probability\_trades/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected_value_and_high_vs_low_probability_trades/)), and from my basic probability knowledge, that this will come out to an expected value of zero for any options trade. So if I was to run thousands of trades, I would net zero.In this sense, my understanding is that in order to actually make money you need to have some sort of edge. For a large hedge fund, this can be getting better prices/premiums than a retail investor would. What I'm trying to understand is what that competitive edge is for you that ensures you make money/are profitable on a trade like your iron condor on Shopify. Because, if my understanding is correct, then even though that trade has a really low likelihood of crossing your put/call strike prices, the profitability potential accounts for that. So even if you made a little bit each time on Shopify from 100 trades like that, if one of those trades went against you, that could wipe out the profits from the other 99 trades. What I'm trying to understand is what you’re evaluating/considering before making this trade so it doesn’t end up losing you money and come out profitable.Sorry that this is really long. I’m just trying to get my question across to you as clearly as possible. And thanks again for all of your help!

Any thoughts on how you managed your portfolio of options for this "experiment"? Seemed you had most of the trades correlated to the same factors and short vol (mostly IC and strangles). I wonder how much diversification did you really get to your overall portfolio.Thanks again and keep up the great educative work in here

If I make a 95% probably of profit trade, and I do it 100 times, wouldn't I theoretically make let's say $1 per trade for 95 trades, and in the other 5 trades lose $95, so basically it equals out and my net profit is nothing?

AgEagle, if it is even indeed "partnered" with Amazon, is only one of dozens of UAV providers who will be developing solutions for Amazon.But... My money is on the FAA shutting "drone delivery" down even before it gets started.  And, certainly, the moment a people carrying aircraft is involved in a mid-air collision with a "delivery drone" (which **will** happen within the first quarter of widespread "delivery drone" operations), this entire pipe dream will be shut down.

Any competent investor knew the Amazon rumor was only JUST A RUMOR. That the company was always going to become successful on its own by fulfilling the massive niche for agricultural mapping and thermal drone imaging. This also plays into the security and consumer delivery industries aswell, but I think the main drive has always been the agricultural market. Bots filling comment sections talking about insider sell-offs and it going back to $.20. The company is actively engaging with other businesses and growing to become the leader in its sector. I’m all with it I don’t care it was never amount short term gains so I’m averaging down. All I see are catalysts and a fat discount. I’ll keep averaging down. Not financial advice.

It is calculated by averaging the past day of AHI values and then dividing it by the average AHI over the past week for that stock.* I wanted to use this to see if it could predict any big price changes for social medias favourite stocks.\n\nBased on this I decided to do some technical analysis.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 03:37:08'] You are on to something but would need to play with the model and refine it. The model needs not only RHI (which seems to indicate only volume) but also actual emotion/sentiment (positive, negative, excited, optimistic, furious etc.).  You also have different cases: sentiment preceding event and sentiment following event. In case of FSLY, the volume (RHI) increased almost certainly in reaction to the event (and I wager, the sentiment was negative) whereas MVIS seems to fit the volume (and positive sentiment)  increasing prior to stock rise. Very interesting - has potential.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 06:59:02'] This is a bad analysis because it is cherry picking.It's also illogical.The first reason, that doesn't seem obvious, is that **sentiment itself is reactionary**.>*Many claim that social media is reactive to price changes and this is absolutely not the case a substantial amount of the time; it is very predictive if you look for the right signals.*&#x200B;A more sound consideration is the fact that MVIS was not traded heavily at all for a very, very long time (over 5 years) so arguments that pose short-term sentiment has predictive power in price changes would be no different than posing that momentum trading works. The same is true of all of the other items; there's nothing here that indicates that over time this is true and random segments of time (in this case, one quarter) are flat out noisy; for instance Tilray is a "weed play"; there's nothing about Tilray fundamentally that makes it interesting therefore there's nothing about this patternwork that indicates that this is rational *for Tilray*. It might be rational *for the sector*.If it is rational for the sector your entire proposition is fucked. It makes zero sense. Now we do already use sector based argumentation so there's little to be said of that but that again completely destroys your proposition; in the case of OCGN penny stocks everywhere have been flying off the handle even without real viability, in the case of MVIS, no one cared about the technology until Tesla and Auto-Driving became popular *which means that it is not actually sentiment for the company, it's sentiment for a series of "correlated" ideas*.I could go on and on about how this is just really bad research and likely complete and utter noisy bunk because it's not been shown true at random points in history and you've got extremely correlated timeframes to boot with an equivalent environment for each one but there's only one way to truly see if something works empirically:Trade it.So, put the money up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 10:39:11'] AMZN was pushed down by good earnings and but weak guidance for Q3. Of course you can't bet against AMZN but I think it will trade sideways for a while. Today it broke down it's 200 SMA. Although a call doesn't seem like a bad play. Next level of resistance is in the 3390ish. Maybe I would do a longer DTE than two weeks, something between 30-45 so you don't get theta gang banged haha. Just my two cents. Good luck!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 15:13:21'] Amazon is cyclical. Check the charts. Second half is typically down and sideways movement. Big growth follows the dip in late Feb/early March and runs until Q2 earnings in July/august.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 13:07:28'] Watch that 10yr bond yield rate, Amazon usually moves when the yield is going up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 17:10:01'] Two weeks is **far** too short of a time span. Amazon is expensive, buy a debit spread. After the IV cooled off after the earnings drop I opened a 3550/3750 spread for 9/16/22. It doesn't have to be this wide, but if you think Amazon is going to be even marginally higher than it is now in a year you can make a lot of money. This one in particular cost $6,500 and pays out $13,000 if Amazon is over 3750 in a year.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 14:58:52'] You don't want to look at delta without looking at gamma.  Delta is instantaneous.  Delta can change with theta and vega also.  It's hard to look at options just based on one of the Greeks.AMZN options are high priced and a small move down in AMZN pps or change in iv can obliterate an option premium.  I would not evaluate potential plays based on delta.  I would look at them based on time and how far in or out the money they are.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 16:19:27'] Best bet (although it’s pricey) is to get calls that extend past earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 06:40:57'] Thanks guys for sharing your knowledge. I bought two calls and I sold one before the market closed, I'm still holding to one call (AUG 27 $3230)and I migh sell it today. The reason I only did two weeks and delta 0.5 is because I was expecting a fast rebound like the one from yesterday I just didn't know it was going to be on the same day, The risk is higher but is a good return. AMZN went from 3220 and closed at 3299.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 08:05:42'] Like everyone is saying it's definitely not a cheap stock to buy options in. With my little baby sized account I might do a call spread though because it definitely has fallen quite a bit recently

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 08:37:08'] Let's take a look at the $160 AAPL call (midway to your 150-170 range) for as close to 1 year out as we can get, which is the  Sep 2022 OTM call. We can use delta as an estimate of the probability of expiring ITM, which is any price at or over 160. The delta on the Sep 2022 160 call is 49. That means there's roughly a 49% chance that call will expire ITM. 49% seems a lot lower than the 100% you claim to KNOW the price will reach, and yet the market is pricing that call at a much lower probability of ITM. It appears that the market doesn't completely agree with your assessment that AAPL must be over 160 by next September. Otherwise the 160 call would have a delta of 100.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 09:14:27'] Be careful out there people. This is the kind of talk that accompanies all major market tops. "100% chance FANG stocks will be higher next year!" LOL. There was also a report last weekend of wildly bullish sentiment among major wall street analysts.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 14:11:25'] The option could be very expensive.  An ATM AMZN Jan 2023 LEAP is $441.  So during expiration, this LEAP will be worth 0 if it went up less than $441.  The problem with the stocks you mentioned are that they have corresponding options that are very high in price and if the option is OTM it will decline with time and IV.You can abate risk by in these options by calendars spreads and vertical spreads on these leaps but they have their own risks but I wont go into that now.  Just suffice to say that there is a cost for the LEAP and you create more risk when you try to gain leverage.

May not be able to sell, and rather than risk any downside between now and when they can sell, they sell a call and use the premium to buy a put. They are sacrificing any upside to protect against any downside. Mark Cuban did the same with some stock that the got when his company was acquired. The stock tanked, but  the put minimized his losses. Mostly used by folks who are prohibited from selling for a particular period.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 12:37:53'] Would it be a good move for an inexperienced investor to send some money that way too, mirroring these big orders?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-05 07:08:28'] Thanks for sharing this. Regarding DXC, what makes you so sure that the Call strike was a sale? It was transacted at the offer, not mid or the bid, as was the PUT side. This could be a simple premium play where the player does not expect a big move before expiration and is slightly bullish, selling premium on both side before a rally.

POST_TEXT: b'I put together the below DD for WSB (hence the bullets) and thought I would share here. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a possible short/put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.\n\n* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:\n\n1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.\n2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we '
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-23 10:46:38'] SNOW is trading on 2022 and 2023 figures, not 2020 or even 2021 because it’s growing so fast. Even so, it would still be valued on an EV/Rev multiple much higher than any other software company and your point still remains.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-23 11:15:53'] IV curve ranging between 48-70%I’m thinking put calendars/diagonals might be the best way to express the trade. Snow could have a few more green shoots prior to lockup expiration just on that low float, so I don’t think Call Credit Spreads are worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-23 11:57:55'] what date you guys targeting for your puts?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-23 13:31:08'] Nice DD. I think SNOW is a great company and platform, but the valuation has gotten out of hand and I agree that the increase in the float should create some selling pressure.The other big risk for a stock valued this high is any earnings report. No one cares if they are positive on earnings, but if their growth declines, then you'll see a huge drop. If a company's revenue is growing 100% YoY, you can justify a very forward valuation, but every tick makes a huge difference when you look at a five year forward forecast. The other risk would be lower than expected growth in gross margins. Gonna look at put diagonals and verticals and watch for an opportunity (i.e. green day or big IV differential in term structure).

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-31 11:38:31'] Hey, following up on this post. With it trading at ~280/290 as of right now, would that second lockup condition be invalided? The threshold for 133% would be about 325, and i don’t think it’s been above that for the 10 days needed for the lockup. Curious what your thoughts are.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 23:18:21'] As a follow up to this post. We saw around 8m shares traded today alone, do you think we'll see continuous fluctuations similar to today as more people decide to unload? Or was this it and the support line stands at 210? I would like to believe we see a continuous sell off, however the bull thesis for $SNOW is quite strong and has me cautious. Which leads me to my other point of triggering an over-sell, and swinging back towards bull territory; completely blowing out any puts?

At the money calls are only $2 and could easily be worth $10+ by expirationStill, ETFs are weird. I've been following META since they were new (before FB changed its name). I thought the hype of the Metaverse would take off and while the ETF did have a good run up to $17, it's given back all of those gains so far.I think FB could ironically pose a threat to META. It's been lagging behind other tech stocks and honestly I don't think Zuck's metaverse is really exciting anyone right now. The rebranding seems to have lukewarm response and it could be years before anything tangible actually comes from the changes. But MSFT and NVDA are two tickers that should be guaranteed to gain next year. RBLX is a toss up. So all in all, I think you're better off just investing in MSFT and NVDA. The low price of META is enticing but honestly I don't think its holdings are all that strong. SNAP is a piece of crap and I think AMZN is in for a rough year in 2022

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-28 04:47:19'] Options inherently represent leverage. You’ll be replacing the risk of a margin call with a “baked-in” level of risk in the option that you purchase. That price for your leverage via options is largely represented by the implied volatility in the option you’re buying. You could potentially be replacing less expensive leverage with more expensive leverage. Aren’t there other  solutions like selling off *part* of your Amazon position and not all 50 shares? You can think of your “At the Money” call as giving you control of roughly 53 shares of AMZN (a $189,000 notional value) for only $26,000. That’s a leverage ratio of more than 7 to 1. This option will begin to decay rapidly in about 60 days and if it is still roughly at the money doubly so. Given the IV on the underlying right now you’ve got a decent chance it drops between now and March further eating at the value of your option. None of this means you couldn’t still make money being in the trade. Maybe Omicron means we all go back into lockdown and live via Amazon packages but I would want to dig into all of this if I were you.  I’m not a financial professional just a stranger on the internet. I don’t really know what I’m talking about and this is all probably terrible advice. Caveat Emptor and good luck!

Whether you do that or sell your shares is a determination you can make.Consider if a further expiration makes sense to likely have more extrinsic value in the option when you are looking to sell it. The general advice for shorting options is to do so 30 to 45 days before expiration as that’s when the extrinsic value time decay (theta) starts to increase.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 18:40:08'] Leave it all in the same account.  , Whatever you are holding long term gives you significant buying power for whatever naked options you are writing.  It would seem crazy to me to split this up and leave that buying power do nothing. If you like buying partial shrs, go there, but IMHO best to leave all your taxable trading in the same account.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 18:58:13'] I have two accounts, one that is my serious account and one that was started with $500. I’ve never added to the $500 account and just gamble with it to make money for birthdays, holidays, etc. If you hold securities in your margin account it should increase your available margin, thus increasing buying power and leverage
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 18:29:01'] I keep my options trading separate from all my other stuff and it’s worked well for me, I can track performance between the two better and just overall keeps it much more organized.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 19:22:41'] If you want to seriously trade options then open a separate account.  It will make trading that much simpler and easier to track.With all of the brokers offering free accounts it is simple to open a new account, and for stock trading most are completely free.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 00:32:47'] If you want it. But is overcomplicating things.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:42:53'] I have two separate TD Ameritrade accounts - one for long term and one for short term and greatly prefer it.  I had the same when I was with Interactive Brokers.  For me, it is simpler to keep them separate.  Helps at tax time, easier to scroll through positions (almost all my trades are done from my phone during lunch breaks), and keeps things 'clean' when reviewing trades over the weekend.  I happen to have portfolio margin with both, so that isn't a concern.    Given that accounts at TD are free - I'd suggest adding another account and if you don't like it, you can always merge the accounts and close one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-15 15:15:05'] It'd be comparable to buying on margin, where the premium you pay can be seen as the interest. However, you won't usually get to leverage as well.

POST_TEXT: b'Yesterday I opened a feb 2022 3,300/3,320 spread on Amazon. Cost around $700 I think. This feels like an easy way to get exposure to stocks I normally couldnt afford to own. Other than the stock not being about 3,300 by Feb am I missing something?\n\nDoes anyone only do calls and not spreads?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-14 11:58:33'] This is indeed a great way to get reasonable exposure with limited capital. One of the many advantages of adding options positions to your portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-14 12:06:51'] Your profit is capped at the higher strike (assuming this is a call debit spread) with the underlying already being 3294 you’re not giving yourself much room for profit. Really a matter of preference though dependent on your personal risk tolerance and available funds. “Poor mans covered call” is a similar strategy that achieves a similar result with more upside potential (although more risk) lots of great videos on YouTube about it. [Options Strat] (www.optionstrat.com) is a great site for planning out strategies. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-14 14:39:19'] Three things to keep in mind with spreads.1. You lose your $700 if the stock price is below $3300 Feb $2022. (This you mentioned)2. Return is capped at $20/share. ($2000). And typically you'd seek 50% max profit, which would mean a GTC close  order at $13.53. Whatever you do, don't let your spread go through expiration. Pin risk isn't something you want to mess with. Though you may need to get creative to close a position that is way OTM or ITM if you are using leaps so it's closer to the mark on close.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-29 14:41:09'] Here are my predictions for what it is worth. I am prepared to be wrong and I appreciate OPs post!AAPL - Probably lower than expected revenues. Their stores were closed so that really hurts them and they were closed for a good chunk of the quarter. Furthermore, I read somewhere that when they opened stores, a majority of the customers were not there for new purchases, but for repairs. Their products are expensive and unemployment can't be good for their premium product sales (iphones, laptops, etc.). Big pull back after down into the $350s/$360s.Last note I forgot - hence the edit: The iphone announcement will be HUGE. I read some rumors that they are looking to Q4 now and NOT a September release for the new phone. 49.7% if Apple's revenue comes from Iphone sales!  If they are still pushing for September, all quarterly sales news, good or bad will not even matter. $400+ here we come!AMZN - Amazing revenues.... like insane revenues from both goods and AWS. But lower earnings due to added COVID measures. Small 3-5% pull back into the $2800s, maybe even a bit into the $2700s. AWS is my watch here. MSFT's Azure really crushed it last week. Either they are eating into AWS OR remote work will propel them. The earnings bar is set really high for them so I worry that even as well as they do, they still might disappoint.GOOGL/FB - Who friggin' knows. I can't imagine companies are spending a ton of marketing dollars AND laying people off. That doesn't make sense.NASDAQ/Tech Bubble - There is a retraction UNTIL the new stimulus is passed. And then things pop back up to where they are now. OR until good COVID news is generated (good vaccine, numbers going down, etc.)&#x200B;TL;DR - Fu\*k tomorrow is a really big and frankly scary day. Right now I am leaning more towards a red AH and Friday :( Hope I am wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 03:24:14'] Thanks for the work on the post. Would be interest in other peoples thoughts but here are mineAMZN - I'm thinking due to the various COVID-19 travel restrictions, AMZN had to deal with distribution issues (i.e. rerouting trucks, extra expense with moving inventory), AWS probably killed it, but this will be continually off set by the expense associated with COVID 19 in warehouses.I'm expecting a drop.APPL - I agree with someone that posted earlier, purchases of new phones and devices were slowed by shut downs, and I read somewhere that cook announced subscriptions on news app was down. I anticipate people trimmed their subscriptions, so reoccurring rev. will be downFB - Who knows, when I log in I always see these "stock Gurus" pumping their programs. I anticipate that advertisers are going to move to that vs TV especially given sports are just coming backGoogle - Similar thoughts with facebook, but everyone in states with high covid 19 had to move to online advertising, and also I think their cloud infrastructure is growing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-17 21:53:26'] If your order to close is not filled promptly,  cancel the order and reissue the order, with a revised price to locate the market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-16 09:22:58'] I assume from context this is a long call butterfly and the 136 premium is the debit paid to open?Just think about what happens if they all expire ITM.  The shorts get assigned, and the longs get exercised.  You buy 100 shares at 3300, sell 200 shares at 3310, and buy 200 shares at 3320.  That all nets out to zero, so your loss is the 136 debit paid to open.I'm surprised you can't close it, though. All those strikes have bids and asks.  Maybe you just need to adjust the price.

POST_TEXT: b" Let's say I sell a call option of Amazon which has a strike price of $500 above the trading price which expires this Friday, but let's say amazon rises by $100 and the option contract rise by $20 but the option expires worthless, what is the risk here?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 07:57:10'] Nothing, because you already know the outcome of your senerio.   Now if you sell a naked call, the risk is that it increases and the buyer exercises the option and you now have to buy shares at market price to deliver to the buyer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 08:00:44'] The risk is that Amazon goes up above your strike price.  If that happens your call will get exercised and you'll have to deliver shares.  Since you're naked you'll have to buy the shares in the open market to deliver.  i.e. You'll be buying them at a higher price and selling them to cover the call at the lower (strike) price.If, as in your example, Amazon only rises by $100 and the call expires worthless, then you get to keep the premium you received when you sold the call.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 08:08:34'] If you want to know the risk of naked calls, ask the people who sold naked calls on GME last week.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 20:00:18'] Do not sell naked calls. I will take your money gladly but sometimes feel bad when they hit the strike price because of events not priced into the writing.

	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:19:10'] Selling naked calls on amazon is one of the dumbest ideas I have ever heard on this sub
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 16:39:48'] Previous commenter is incorrect, you can, indeed, sell naked call options on amazon. It may be more of a gamble than it seems, and your brokerage may charge obscene margins on such a transaction, but not as much as owning shares.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:21:57'] You can do a [call credit spread](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/short-call-spread/) rather than a naked call to reduce the margin requirement to the width between the spread.   This is also a trade that can be done without high level trading permissions.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-27 17:37:12'] You should really only ever do this on stock you own. There’s very little reason or sense in selling naked calls, especially on a stock as expensive as amazon. Your losses can be astronomical. If however you purchased 100 shares of amazon and wrote a call against the shares to lower your basis, that would be a substantially better idea. Yes you cap your upside but you gain downside protection and collect premium as income while you roll the short calls. Plus even if amazon explodes upwards you still have a gain from your basis up to the strike of the short call. Then you can sell cash secured puts and go the other way to renter amazon if you wanted.The obvious issue is you need enough cash to buy 100 shares of amazon. Maybe find a cheaper stock and buy/write (purchase shares and sell a call) so you can learn and hopefully make a little $ in the meantime.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:13:06'] First, will your broker allow you to sell a naked call? You’ll need to be very well capitalized and fill out lots of paperwork. Second, your potential loss is theoretically infinite. Multiplied by the odds it’s probably not really that bad, but certainly you want to be vigilant of your position. Third. Upside gaps can be a bitch if you’ve sold naked calls.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 21:46:52'] > If I were to sell a naked call option for 2000, hoping that it stays below that price so I can keep the premium and let it expire on let's say July 5th, I would be able to do that right?Theoretically? Sure. Realistically? You'd be assigned the instant that contract was made.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-27 21:27:20'] The risk of selling a naked call is that if amzn goes above 2000 the buyer can exercise that call, which now leaves you with a short stock position of 100 shares per contract.Would that position blow up your account?If you have a bearish bias you could use the sold naked call to enter a bearish wheel strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 16:33:53'] You can't sell unless you actually have the 100 shares to gamble.You can only buy calls and puts.The analogy of difference is buying $1 lottery tickets (buying calls / puts) and selling $1 lottery tickets (selling calls / puts.)

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-15 09:09:34'] You say “buy from Shopify” but I don’t think you understand what Shopify is, many brands like gym shark / nicce / kraft Heinz / fashion nova (to name some random ones) run their eccomerce through Shopify I think it’s pretty likely you will be buying stuff without even knowing it’s them running the process behind the scenesAnd, I went from seeing a Tesla very rarely and being like “wow cool a Tesla” to seeing multiple a day, so they’re definitely growingFurthermore, many people and institutions do have money and buying houses is EXACTLY what they’re doing, the largest institutions in America are buying single family homes en mass and the already ridiculously priced rental market is just going to get further squeezedAlthough, I do pretty much agree with the point I think the tech giants are going to carry the market for a while so it won’t be crashing soon, but as you pointed out, there is some ridiculously stupid p/e stocks, and once the giants show signs of slowing the uncertainty could cause a market wide crumble

Semiconductors/microchips whatever you wanna call them are literally in everything we buy now except food/water (hopefully? Lol). I'm long Gas/Oil (XOM, COP) and Semiconductors the next couple years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-12 09:01:05'] > Rolling loosing credit or debit spreads seem common place.Not true. Futile attempts to rescue losing trades may be commonplace, which means you see a lot of discussion about those attempts, but what you don't see is the final outcome, which may be a larger loss than if they had just cut their losses sooner.You roll the untested side of an IC because it's the profitable side. Realizing some profit reduces the size of your net loss, at least in that moment in time. There's nothing that says your tested wing can't lose more money in the future.And who rolls the tested side of vertical spreads? Normally the entire spread is rolled, not just one leg.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 11:15:32'] One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is "settled" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/Personally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/This is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. I'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. tldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 18:07:12'] I would counter by saying that the market isn’t distracted, and you should be more focused on how yields are performing. However I’m with you on a bullish case for semiconductors. But...and just hear me out, AMD has struggled to get above their top resistance point which is like $96/$97 a share. I dunno if I would buy a $100 strike bc of that. Also, while this take is going to be widely unpopular one here, I’m more bullish on intel right now than AMD. Especially with yields doing what they are. It’s P/E ratio is only like 13 and has huge upside potential.This is not financial advice.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 23:46:48'] I think tech overall has been declining in interest after their amazing run-up last year.

POST_TEXT: b'Stock Repair Strategy on AMZN\n\nSo I like many fellow traders have had a rough week. I sold a amzn csp a few months ago at a strike of 3590 I know it was pretty stupid of me but I liked amazon especially with newer variants coming out and I assumed even with that pretty high strike I could sell CCs and make a decent amount of premium. Now Im down around 20% and I have been doing a lot of research into different Stock Repair Strategies and have pretty much narrowed it down to two. Sell a covered call below my cost basis and roll if it ever gets threatened or use a ratio spread to lower my cost basis. Now no matter how much research I do I still cannot figure out how doing a ratio spread on this position would allow me to break even. Can someone please explain to me how doing a ratio spread or some other stock repair strategy would improve my cost basis. Anyone other helpful suggestions on strategies, tips, literally anything at all would be most appreciated.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 00:42:16'] Buying the dip would lower your cost basis. Selling covered calls would too. Just depends on how fast you want to “repair” your position. And you say ‘break even’, do you not expect Amazon to go back up eventually and expect to exit the trade as soon as you do? If I was bullish on the stock I would sell cc’s until the price goes up and continue afterwards or if bearish if thinking it’ll go lower just exit the trade.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive been reading up on the wheel and theres something Im just not getting. The premiums on selling puts/calls seems to be somewhere in the range of 3%. Meanwhile, you lock up significant amounts of cash (assuming cash secured/covered). Wouldnt it just be easier and wouldnt the returns be better just by putting that cash straight into a stock, like Amazon or any other of the other tech stocks posting >3% gains this year? And with stocks, theres no realized gain to have to be taxed on either. \n\nThoughts on why to wheel versus just parking money in a stock?'
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 23:15:26'] If you sell a cash secured put every week at a 1% premium dont you end up with 52% gain on your initial capital annually? Just a theoretical question.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 23:25:05'] The wheel is just another trading technique. Sometimes it will out perform and other times it will under perform. It is also designed to generate income.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 23:12:59'] Annualized return. How long is your expiration for the 3%? For instance, if it’s 1 month, that would be 3% each month. Versus 3% a year. Don’t forget compounding too.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 23:22:17'] There’s always a debate on this subject and experiences vary as well. Some may do well constantly selling puts until a sizable market pullback happens and then they all of the sudden find themselves in deep losses, especially if they hadn’t managed their risk and sold a lot of options on margin and what not.Others feel that even when wheeling works in an ideal manner, you can miss out on significant upside due to your profit often being capped by covered calls. And yet others, as some are already commenting in this thread, feel that they can beat the market each year with this strategy. Your mileage may vary.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 07:14:01'] On average, buy and hold does better during bull phases. Compare QQQ and QYLD. Now of course, some people beat the averages. Above average performers tend to be more active on Reddit. So be wary of people posting about personal experience. The population is skewed. During flat or slightly down markets selling premium does better.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 07:14:30'] Wheels because more steady income and less risk.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 14:56:41'] For some reason people on this sub have big issue with the wheel. If you think it's a right strategy for you  then do it. Just try to manage the risks. Sell puts and calls at at at least .30 delta or lower dont be greedy. If you get assigned the stock and do not want to keep it then  sell a call close to ATM to get rid of it as soon as possible. You cannot predict how high or low it will go. But you can still get profit from premium and if goes up past your call strike you still make some on the sale.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 15:02:45'] Parking money in a stock if you can get cheap leverage is definitely better from tax standpoint . Kind of a tough comparison to the wheel though
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 09:57:01'] Wheeling is a way to pull 50% per year with less risk.Stock goes up? Sell contract.Stock goes down? Sell contact.If you want to YOLO TSLA for b1g t3nD13zZz then you don't need to wheel.If you want 1% per week regardless of the way a stock trends, you need to wheel.Buy and hold for gains is roulette.Wheeling is poker.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-14 17:54:27'] You will always have better gains from just holding a stock due to trading frictions, slippage, assignment risks, taxes and effort.The only caveat is that, even with dividend stocks, the cash flow is extremely poor.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-02 12:50:39'] This is awesome, thanks for sharing. I’m just learning about options so this was instructive. By contrast I own one share of Amazon and it’s appreciated 13%, or roughly $230. But it took a lot of capitol to get that one share and this is a relatively small gain (and still unrealized). A while back I set aside $5k to dip my toe in the stock market (I have more savings in safer Vanguard funds). The stocks I own have appreciated just over 50% so far which is nice but not the kind of money to send kids to private school (and not money in the bank yet either). Anyway, thus the interest in options. It may not be the best fit for me in the end, but I’m starting to look into it.I’m curious, and this reveals my fundamental lack of understanding about options here, but when you sell your calls to close out, who is buying them and what are they doing with them? Is anyone actually buying 100 shares of Amazon at that lower strike price? That can’t be, but if not then what are they for? I’m missing some essential understand of what options and are and how they actually work. Any help from anyone here would be appreciated. Also, nice work!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-30 07:32:22'] I got burned HARD by selling 20 July 60 calls last Friday. Had to hedge Monday morning at a -$32k loss (80% of the premium I received). Thank God I hedged when I did or I would have gotten liquidated at -$100k or so. And this was only with a $100k account. I got lucky and purchased 5 of the calls back and sold the 500 shares to break even on those 5/500. Should have held a bit longer and could have cleaned house, but when the trade goes bad and there is no fundamentals in play for me to risk holding the shares past break even all I try to do is limit losses/damage control. Someone will time this thing right and sell some naked calls and make bank, but those of us who thought 60 was insane last Friday and are thinking 300 is insane now could be in for a massive loss. Who knows. The naked guys had a fraction of a percent of losing these trades receiving 33% premiums, but they won that losing lottery (like me). I'm out of trying to profit from this one myself. I'll be happy if I can manage to weather it and my options don't get executed (or if they do at this point, I'd rather be out because when this thing tanks I could be worse off hedging at $96.41) and somehow still break even or cut my losses in half at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-26 14:52:44'] Wouldn't touch this even if wearing 2 condoms.  Only way to play would be a spread and then constantly watching to close with a profit if it moves in your favor.  This thing has way too much rapid movement.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:39:43'] Tax reasons, Div payments, Liquidity, Blackswan Events, Inability to re-allocate are just to name a few. I do agree that in some cases where I have a strong conviction and there is no div, low drawdowns but a steady price rise expected by me not analyst ($DBA) longer date calls are a good alternative to common shares. In 12 months, you still have to sell your calls before expiration and timing can be tricky if you let your greed take over. That being said watch out for seasonality, try to get a good entry price and don't average down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:39:27'] Read my answer here that compares buying long dated calls as a substitute for stock ownership:[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mslgmf/cons\_to\_leaps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mslgmf/cons_to_leaps/)
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:16:04'] Leaps are functionally leverage, with the extrinsic being interest. Unlike leverage your losses are capped at 100%.It's a very legitimate strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:32:39'] I don’t believe delta is time based.What you’re describing (if the option is ITM) is a LEAPS, this is a legit way of long term trading that can be very lucrative.The only way you can learn for next time is maybe to buy LEAPS after earnings since beforehand they options have lots of implied volatility (IV) meaning that you pay an extra premium. Say nothing happened to the stock price of Amazon after earnings, then you’d get IV crushed without any compensation in stock increase. So in this respect it’s kind of a gamble on what Amazon does over earnings.Also when you say it should be worth more than it is today, you have to remember at expiration, in order to make a profit the stock price must be above (option price + strike price)
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:04:56'] Let's assume you are looking at $xyz that is currently at $100 a share.1.  Buy LEAPS, target strike of $120, expiry 1/2023, cost = $3000.  2.  Buy 100 shares of stock, cost = $10000.Now fast forward to 1/2023, a lot has happened in over a year, but through some ups and downs $xyz is still sitting right at $100.  If you went with option 1 you would have a -3000 position.  If you went with option 2 you would be even.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 09:31:27'] This strategy is commonly referred to as "LEAPS." It's pretty straightforward, and makes a lot of sense in situations like the one you are describing. That being said, you are also exposed to a variety of risks, including theta decay, IV Crush, entry into a bear market, or, of course, the company failing. This was a massive simplification, so check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awb81Tvbz4E) if you want to learn more about LEAPS.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 15:36:33'] You might try a ZEBRA strategy using LEAPS, where you don't need to worry at all about time decay, will never get a margin call, and not pay any margin interest. Dividends already factored in, if applicable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 21:28:42'] Yes, this is perfectly viable. If you want to use this as stock replacement, then .80+ delta is ideal. These are called LEAPs. Depending on the underlying, this may provide tremendous leverage with very little time decay.It’s problematic to have your entire portfolio be LEAPs because % wise they move faster than the underlying and your portfolio could be (at least temporarily) blown up with a 20% move to the downside of the underlying. So, consider mixing LEAPs with owning stock, maybe 100 shares per option? Or you can keep a greater cash position to hedge against your LEAPs crashing? You will just have to play around and see what works best for you.

If you don't have the cash and your option is ITM, then RH sells it on your behalf at market price.

There are some very good and likewise very bad free online resources and hard part is telling them apart for someone starting out.

Those who can't, teach.Maybe a few, they really want to help and teach the rest how to be successful without expecting anything in return.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 00:03:00'] They're pretty much all scams or teach you basic things you could've found out on YouTube or googling for free.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 18:50:28'] it’s a lot easier to claim you can make $100k and sell a $100 course (where in small letters it says “results may vary ect.” than to actually trade. you need say $20k for ads and then 1200 people to buy it for $100 each and you made $100k profit. where in trading for that same $20k you would need %500 returns to match it. these people usually know very little and move from one grift to another.edit: of course there are real people but there are an overwhelming amount of basically scammers. i personally think a book and free internet learning can get you all the info you need. good things to watch out for are talking about being tired of fake gurus, claims of how you can make X amount of money, and just showing off more of a lifestyle than info. (driving a nice car showing a very nice house instead of talking about real trading things.

Some do it to consolidate their understanding,  and to have a rationale to organize their thoughts for themselves. There can be an income, if a producer assembles 100, or 1,000 paying customers, enough to support a research staff, and a web presents. 1,000 times a modest $50 a month is $50K gross a month.

Got 4 tires, a steering wheel, GPS, AC, Air bag, etc.Mcdonalds, Burger King, Wendys, In-N-Out, Five Guys What is the difference? They are all burgers, some cost more, some are faster, some have better French Frys.Dial soap, Ivory soap, Irish Spring soap What is the difference? They all produce bubbles and clean your body.This list can go on and on and on and on, e.g. Nike/Adidas/UA/PumaAs long as someone or some company feel they can make $$ making something, they will.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-12 04:41:20'] There's no difference b/t the strikes haircut because if you sold the $3195 call, you'd be receiving that amount in intrinsic value.  It's a wash.    Theoretically, there's nothing wrong with your strategy.  It caps the upside, locks in the gain and eliminates downside risk.  However, its success is based on AMZN rising in the morning and then after selling the $3195 call, AMZN must drop so that you can book gains on the $3195 call and then AMZN must then rise so that you gain on your remaining long $3200 call.  That's a lot to expect and achieve in 3 days.

POST_TEXT: b'I just finished reading [Option Volatility and Pricing by Natenburg](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Volatility-Pricing-Strategies-Techniques/dp/0071818774/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3U5953KE3TON2&dchild=1&keywords=option+volatility+and+pricing+by+sheldon+natenberg&qid=1607265539&sprefix=option+vol%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-3). Amazing book, but Page 480 (comparing expected standard deviation moves of options with actual moves over a 10 year time period) just blew my mind. Most of my strategies are based on the assumption that the expected standard deviation of an option is roughly equal to the probability, but obviously not. The expected standard deviation of an option underestimates the number of small moves, overestimates the number of intermediate moves, and underestimates the number of large moves. Unfortunately, Natenburg touches on this topic but just moves on, without going into depth about it\n\nDoes anyone know of any books that can help me under this concept better? Something with more research on '
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-06 06:59:31'] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distributionBlack-Scholes assumes underlying prices follow a log-normal distribution, meaning their logarithms are normally distributed. Not sure if this is exactly what you’re asking, but it’s a good place to start.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-06 09:43:21'] Download the time series data of whichever financial instrument you like. Calculate the log daily returns of said instrument. Now run 4 separate calculations. The first being the average of the returns (the mean), the second being the standard deviation, the third being the skew, and the fourth being the kurtosis. Almost every single time you will see the same thing. A kurtosis value > 3. Kurtosis is the fourth moment of the distribution. Higher amounts of kurtosis (leptokurtosis) causes a higher than expected amount of data to be within +-1σ, and a lower than expected between 2 & 1 σ and an excess of data outside of +- 3σ. Essentially what this is showing is that there are lots of little moves, and lots of large moves. At the back of the Natenberg book there is a brief look at implying distributions from the prices of butterflies. In the BSM world, this implied distribution at time T will be perfectly fit to the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation fit to the annualised standard deviation given by the option prices. However, for equity indices, in the real world option prices observed give an implied distribution that had a negative skew, and fat tails. You can compare the distributions from these prices to the standard normal distribution given by the ATM vol. You can see the difference and it’ll look very much like the Natenberg example. The debate is whether skew is underpriced or overpriced. Is it cheap to buy or expensive to sell? There is a tonne of interesting material out there to look at. Whilst he’s a total knob, Taleb makes for good reading with some of his newest stuff. Anyhow, hope that was helpful. Happy reading!
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-06 09:38:36'] The optionalpha.com preaches about this distribution especially on the DOW it overestimates the volatility and people lose money on OTM options because of that. The way to take advantage of this is to sell options way OTM. Shit slow money but it’s consistent

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 08:40:52'] What is the purpose of your short duration long puts?  To express a bearish view?  I typically only engage in such a trade if the long put is the same or higher strike than the longer duration short put.  In the trades above, if AMZN tanks, your shorts will have much larger losses than your longs have gains.  In addition, the BP reduction will increase as the longs approach expiration.  I don't typically do short calendars on equities and stick to futures, so I don't know if the collateral requirements for short calendars follows a different formulation.  BUT, as my longs approach expiration and I still want to milk the theta out of the short legs, I would consider "renewing" the long puts to a further out expiration.  That, in futures space, reduces collateral requirements.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-24 14:15:03'] Is this a cash covered position or is it naked?You can buy a December 3100 strike put and this would reduce your margin requirement to that of the spread.  It would have the same objective but it would reduce the credit of the position.  You may also try a call back spread which would be short term bearish and long term bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 08:02:35'] I mean a lot of this is based on what you think will happen.  My opinion would lean towards staying in your current position given the runup, as I expect a pullback in the nearterm.  But, I don't use these strategies in general, too coinflippy while theta eats me.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 08:08:19'] 5/15 is still a way out.  I'd wait closer to expiration before considering rolling.  Since you're rolling, I'd calculate the BE as the difference between the total cost of the play. Otherwise, it's just a new trade.$283-32.35+17.27-17.39 = whatever that is.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 08:58:22'] Keep the trade. Sell some spy puts and collect some premium, help offset some costs. The markets are rigged so good luck bud.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 23:49:11'] Id personally roll over to the 7/17 puts. 1) theta hurts less and 2) your break even points are so close a move downward in the immediate future shouldnt hurt too bad. Meanwhile a downturn in say 2/3 weeks would see the value of the 7/17 puts surpass the 5/15 since theta will have really kicked in by that time. At this moment 300p puts for 4/27 are $13 and change with SPY at 286. With a week left until expiration the only real value in options is intrinsic value. Theta KILLS.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 08:36:22'] I understand the strategy, but you're pinning your money on a maybe. Not just any maybe either, but a maybe we all anticipate. The trade has moved against you and I think that tech can keep and the like can keep SPY up. You have a number of things you can do my top 3 are:Get out and move the money elsewhere. There are always plays to be made on something else that can generate profit.Roll out and hope you're right.Sell OTM puts to recoup capital. Either hold current position or roll out and do it. All depends on you
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 10:35:45'] I’m in a similar boat. I got killed on 4/17 puts and am currently about even on 6/19 SPY and IWM puts. I think that’s enough time but plan to reevaluate at EOM. Also I agree about IWM being the better candidate for a sharp move down, might close the SPY put altogether and move it into IWM.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-18 08:11:38'] >I buy some time for country to open up, cases to spike, second round of lockdownsI do not want to change your perspective, but I'd like to offer you a different view to consider: Stanford just published a study saying the real number of infected people is 50-85 times greater than is being reported. That means, the death rate is actually less than a whole fraction. That means, it isn't that scary. There most likely won't be a second round of closures. I have told people that this is about the oil war and reelection for Trump. They had Opec+ and G20 meeting and then a week later started discussing reopening the economy. So, the virus just disappeared because we fixed the oil situation? This week they started reporting on potential cures. GILD has been making headlines, yet when this whole thing started, no one was talking about the article that said 2 guys on the west coast created a cure for covid-19 in 3 hours. The big news was the stimulus package signed into place. That is for the elections. Without this fear of a virus, how could you bleed the country to pay everyone off? How could you get funding from the most valuable man in the world (Bezos)? Force his numbers to increase. Amazon is crushing it right now. Now that all the pieces are in place, we need to reopen by May 1st. The truth Trump has discussed is, we NEED to reopen the country. As the USA we only have our work and production backing us, take that away and WE WILL FAIL as a country. The scary thing that will bring the market down again: Unemployment #s and missed EPS. This market is trending on Hope's and dreams. No reason it should be climbing, we know numbers are going to be miserable. Companies are bleeding money, the future is uncertain and the economy is shutdown. How could the market be climbing? We are all remembering 2009 and how cheap things were and the huge gains that came from it. People that have no idea about investing or finance are saying this is the best time to invest. Why, because that's what happened in 2009? Sorry for the rant.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 11:55:02'] If you want a chance at succeeding with options, you really need to understand the inter-relationship between option strategies, be able to adjust positions if defending them and how to employ disciplined risk management. You're not going to learn much more than the basics online.    Pick up a copy of "Options as a Strategic Investment" by Lawrence G. McMillan. Read it. Then read it again. It is well written with many clear examples. It also explains a variety of more complex option strategies and should they intrigue you, you can read more.    "Option Volatility & Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques" by Sheldon Natenberg is worthwhile if you want to learn about the Greeks, etc. but AFAIC, most of that isn't needed for the Average Joe retail trader.

If the stock moves higher, the call "should" make more money, and lose if it goes down.  However, using this strategy your risk is limited.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-11 05:33:35'] You got roughly $18 between the bid and ask. My guess is your looking for a good deal on the buy. $18 is a lot of room to work with.Also might have been a specific time trade.  Perhaps there was a more narrow margin between the bid/ask for those strikes at the time of the post.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-11 00:40:19'] They suggest very safe spreads. 2-3% move in the stock gives more than 100% returns in 2 years. They even recommended SHOP and AAPL spreads for 2023. Which are in the money now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 10:33:23'] Not going to happen. You need highest level of account authorization, plus 20 to 25 percent of the strike price. So about $100k cash in the account for each call sold.Some do a credit spread which may greatly reduce the cash collateral. Don't be like the Reddit idiots doing $5 or $10 wide spreads on AMZN. The bid ask eats almost all the profit. Most likely outcome for a narrow spread, is the broker force closes the spread for a loss on expiration day.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-14 05:11:17'] Yes.   I have it and have read it twice.    Like most options books I usually find a few nuggets in there that are helpful but the main problem with this book is the options market has changed so much.   Many of the ideas and examples he gives assume monthly option expiration like we had back in 2009.  Now, most liquid options have weekly expirations (and some like SPY have expirations 3 times per week).   This is a huge shift for anyone trying to play expiration effects like stock pinning which is a big chunk of the book.&#x200B;I backtested a few of the strategies and could not really find any that would have worked (at least not in the time period I tested).   I am not saying they don't work, just that things are so different now.   If you watch some of his more recent interviews on Youtube I think in one of them he even says he does not use these strategies anymore.  He seems have jumped into the TA arena and is now selling an system of indicators which was dissapointing to see.  I was kinda hoping he would be a billionaire from all his options knowledge and living on an island somewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 13:23:14'] Two words: short squeeze.You thought Nikola had r*tard strength? This bad boy has over 100% short interest and is now backed by Microsoft. I consider myself lucky to have picked up 1/15 30c for .60 after the first pop
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 17:17:16'] I bought GME shares since Ryan Cohen put out his 13D where he started picking up shares in the company.I would say buy puts at your own risk, because while the partnership isn't so much a partnership but more like upgrading their in-store technology at the POS. There are way too many people short on this stock and this isn't even the real big squeeze that is about to come.Several factors that could contribute to a potentially huge short squeeze include:Ryan Cohen buying more shares of the stock, announcing a new type of partnership where he gets more involved with the business strategy.New game console cycle, the numbers when they come out will paint a very good picture of whether digital games will dominate or do people still want hard discs, since there will be both versions of a console available this time, people's dollars will speak.Gamestop, also makes more with the sale of console accessories, since the old consoles have been long in the tooth, not as many gamers really have the need to update their old system controllers, etc.They have also redesigned their mobile app, and are pushing for a larger piece of the e-commerce side of business.Focusing on e-commerce has brought Michaels back to life as well as BBBY. I think the short squeeze is a cherry on top but GME has the right set of momentum going forward even without the squeeze to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 13:22:16'] You're planning on buying overpriced puts because you think there will be a technical pullback? I wouldn't advise it but tbh you probably already missed your opportunity. If there is a technical pullback it will happen after hours/pre market likely. Go look at party city. I made some money off calls earlier this summer but it looks like the bullish momentum has worn off a bit. I think there might be some better plays to be made there rather than GME. Iv is too high.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 15:53:29'] I feel sorry for whoever was selling  gme calls
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 14:01:19'] Big IV increase and huge short squeeze possible, probably better to sell far otm puts as opposed to buying unless you really think this is tanking completely.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-08 18:42:36'] I am going to go in on puts but only in November. I need the consoles to release, I need this at it's maximum price, because it will fall. That is something I know. The play itself is going to take nearly 8 months though so that sucks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-01 07:21:02'] Why is there no interest in GME puts
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-05 07:42:18'] Searched "GME puts" on Google and came to this.Did you put or not at the end?

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 16:00:04'] Yep, these are all mistakes people make.  There many more.It's quite a mind dump.  There are some right and wrong takeaways you're listing.  Like for example:>Theta is seller asking how much pain you'll take. Gamma is buyers version of this question.Not sure what this means.I also notice you mention trading with stops.  Not actual stop orders, right?  That becomes a market order when triggered.Generally I'll say that nothing is absolute.  "Never buy options" isn't accurate.  Sometimes it's the best play.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 18:57:01'] Long story short: Always hedge and manage your risk.  
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 20:47:50'] Thanks for sharing your hard lessons.  One day I hope to understand half of what you’ve said.
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 16:50:38'] Yep, always GTFO when CNBC is talking about something you're in. That was always a key cue I held even before I started refining a strategy.Pretty accurate. Also, TA is for finding out about the past not telling anything of the future--common mistake. This probably worked nicely in the 1960's but now it's like running an algo on an 8088 and thinking that you'll be competitive.Gotta know where you can compete and where you can't. The niche for a retailer is narrow but it exists. The problem is that too many people try to trade like a major firm and don't have the capital to do that shit and certainly don't have the risk controls or even the foundational understanding of the risk controls.
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 17:27:17'] Peace, homie. Surprised it was you. Time is the ultimate leverage. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-30 00:25:51'] One of the best posts in this subreddit all year. > Options without PM margin is suckers gameThis is #1 in my opinion. Hard lesson to learn and a long lesson as you need the right account circumstances before even getting started analyzing trading like this first hand, and when you get there it feels like you are back at square 1 on the learning curve, because everything you learned about options trading with a child's account turns out is seriously incomplete, useless or wrong. I am back at/still at square one in my learning I feel, even tho I been doing this for a few years now. It is easy to get the basics but tough to get good without a mentor or working in the industry for a time - not impossible to self learn just a long road and I'd love to figure out a better way to address this. I like your one hand tied/nuts kicked analogy and I agree. It took me too long to realize if you as a trader can't step in to buy or short a full +100 delta of the stock that underlies a contract should you need to (*and* hold that delta overnight when needed) then you are not truly trading options on stocks. You are trading *options on options* at best, I don't know what to call it, most likely you're trading options on lies, hopes, dreams and prayers. Options are contracts with benefits to both buyer and seller, if you can't utilize all the benefits of a contract (should you want to or need to) compared to others in the market who can then you will always be stuck paying full price for a thing but only getting half its features. You give away value for free because you can't utilize it and you may be giving it away without even knowing it. Even if you did realize what is actually happening, you are outgunned in the market and a sucker indeed. Holding all the risk in exchange for a fraction of the reward, maybe. PM margin or at the very least PDT size accounts are a must in order to bring trading in options markets to a slightly, tolerable level of unfair. > *Your over leveraged if cannot take day off"Is this a quote? It's interesting. I guess you could also argue 'if you can take a day off you are under leveraged'. That's ok. Taking a day off shouldn't be free, there should be some cost. Maybe the goal should be a cost as minimal as possible. There are no perpetual motion machines. Even the most algo of algo trading shops I have seen, with many more computers than employees, still have humans show up to work in the office *every day*. There is no such thing as a stable perfect amount of leverage either, so maybe lever up on good on days when you are fully present, and lever down on days you take off, hopefully these days balance in the right way. Learning on how to adjust that ongoing leverage and risk is the real skill, art and science There are many ways people go about it. I like to use calendar and diagonal spreads. I think calendar and diagonals are the most misunderstood and mispriced premiums in the market. I don't claim to understand them or price them better than anyone else, but at least I know the market maker across from me in the trade can't price them better either. We are guessing together. Ever read a good explanation of the relationship between option price, implied volatility and vega? You have not. Because all else equal and constant, implied volatility = price, and so vega is basically as useful as saying if $100 goes up to $101, that is a 1% increase so $1 = 1%, for now, maybe. Vega is not a risk. Volatility might be a risk tho. In long calendar spreads you will often read you are long volatility and/or long vega...OK...At the same time you will read a long calendar spread profits when the underlying security stays relatively stable and moves little and it losses money if the underlying experiences any relatively large rapid moves in either direction (now that sounds a lot like volatility to me). Well fuck which is it? A calendar spread long volatility but it losses money when the stock is volatile? WTF. Volatility helps long dated options more than short dated options you say AND volatility is what kills a calendar spread? Both can't be true. But both are true. You could say there is a difference between volatility and implied volatility? That's obvious because volatility is volatility and IV is just an output of price. A calendar spread is both long and short volatility at the same time in an unknown ratio the market will decide later. If you want to take a day off sometimes, calendar spreads are your friend, shifting the term structure of the position or flipping the short and long sides make for relatively easy adjustments and hedging. Enjoy Europe with the family. I look forward to reading more of your posts.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-30 01:42:00'] Well firstly, my condolences - it is never fun to lose money much less fight to the death to keep what you have and I always try never to kick a man while he is down (not just in trading). That being said, it sounds like you learned a lot and I am sure that knowledge will become valuable in time. Never underestimate the value of a break from the screens. Have a nice holiday and recharge.
