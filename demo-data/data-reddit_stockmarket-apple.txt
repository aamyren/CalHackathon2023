	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:23:07'] You think $3500 is bad, just wait for the $400 charging adapter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:08:39'] If its biggest problem is the price, Apple will have done amazing work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 18:02:49'] $0 working in the office.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:29:11'] For 3500 dollars it better suck my dick and make me pancakes
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 17:45:45'] You get what you pay for.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:26:20'] What a meme.A lot of people in this thread are forgetting that they might not be the target audience. "It's too expensive for me". Okay. It's not too expensive for any of the companies I'm working with and they're frothing at the bit to get their hands on a bunch. It'll change the way they'll demo their products. It'll change the way they'll design the layouts of their systems inside of buildings. They tried it with the hololens and that kinda worked, but this is so much better already.People here seem to forget that Apple didn't use to focus on the consumer market at all, that kinda came when Jobs introduced the iPod. Before that, Apple was known for making expensive but quality business hardware and software with consumer products being less of a priority for most generations. And they kinda never really stopped. The Mac Pro is not meant for regular consumers (although I'm sure some got one). Let alone things like the Pro Display XDR that was memed on heavily for being an expensive display, but is considered by professionals one of the best displays in the field for its purpose and price.It's a useful skill to realize that if you're not the target audience for something, that doesn't mean there is none.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 21:02:04'] You are comparing the best of Apple with the worst of meta; doesn't seem fairüòü

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 17:49:16'] $3,500...who's buying that? Lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 18:44:20'] the vision pro didnt even present a universe though. that's why the meta world looks so weird. it's actually a virtual world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 21:57:02'] I‚Äôll get the Vision Pro if the movie/tv/sports watching experience is good. Most of the time I watch these things alone so it won‚Äôt be awkward for me to wear the Vision Pro. Not at all interested in the app/work features that Apple demonstrated. Pure entertainment is what I think this new device will be great at.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 02:17:03'] OP confusing Meta Horizons (the shitty "metaverse platform") and the Meta Quest 2 headset, which can also function as a full PCVR headset for cheap...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:20:57'] I still think the Meta quest is better product. It has a targeted audience of a younger generation that focuses on gaming and entertainment. The vision pro is very near but who is their intended audience ? Is it a movie entertainment device, is it a productivity machine, is it a memory capture device? I literally have no idea who the device is meant for or who will strap this thing on their head to record these in the moment memories.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:23:55'] To be honest I'd rather talk to an obvious avatar than the creepy uncanny valley "facetime" apple one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 18:18:34'] Only people who want that are young peopleOnly people who can afford that are adultsAin't nobody getting that
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:48:50'] Both look like prototypes of a future everyday product. Neither looks like it‚Äôs going to break through. Meta Quest doesn‚Äôt work well with its own Facebook and instagram and apple vision won‚Äôt work well with anything other than apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:52:33'] Apple headset is still about a year off.  Look up Meta's Codec Avatars, they'll probably drop before the apple headset.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:28:11'] ‚ÄúI'd say the good news is that there's no kind of magical solutions that they have to any of the constraints on laws and physics that our teams haven't already explored and thought of.‚Äù-Zuck, on Vision Pro
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:19:01'] When I see VR headsets I think for setting multiple monitors in it and actually work on your computer from there. The other thing on my mind is virtual housing. Sooner or later shmucks will start buying 'properties' in the so called metaverse and and after some more time we will have the first virtual housing market crash where people will become homeless virtually.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 21:17:30'] 3500 dollars to get your biometrics stolen lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:52:35'] What they have in common is the masses don't give a fuck about VR and both will be relegated to a niche market
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:34:55'] Is there actual in use footage for the Apple?  The promotional videos looks exactly like any other generic tech device.  *Revolutionary!  Exquisite!  Years ahead!*  Somehow never actually shows the product in use.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:36:20'] I laugh at people laughing at apples pricing. Just because quest is cheap doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good product, or that the people laughing at the vision pros price tag are even into AR VR enough to buy a cheaper end quest headset. Apple intentionally wants to price this higher for many many reasons, we‚Äôve all seen this story before with their other products. Just wait and see.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 23:05:43'] If a Apple Vision Pro is for sale in the forest and no one is around to buy it, is it really for sale?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 23:33:38'] Both are a waste of money. It just depends if you want to waste a LOT or a LITTLE?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 23:51:39'] Meta üí©
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:56:59'] both equally stupid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:31:42'] Yeah but no one is paying 3500...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 19:25:31'] If Apple sells enough to keep it alive for a few years with incremental improvements, maybe it'll take off. But the concept of having little screens an inch or so from my eyes for long periods of time sounds sort of debilitating.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 23:25:26'] Both suck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 22:05:08'] Why did Mark share that photo knowing everyone was going to rip him apart, on a Friday afternoon of all things?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 23:37:45'] Apple always joins a lane and dominates it on top of all the acquisitions apple had recently they the best company your lane isn‚Äôt real until apple comes in it sooo yea meta might get some sales as by product but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if vision pro eventually replaces the iPhone. ‚Ä¶ ( 10-20 yrs out )

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:37:57'] So you're comparing a marketing video with a real application? Really?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:38:09'] I am dumbfounded by Zucks take on Apple Vision.  It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre not the same product or audience. Apple has a long way to go before their product is mass ready, but at least they understood that creating real life usefulness is important.  Metas take on it is basically SecondLife.  I fail to see why anyone should care?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:54:20'] The quest is great
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 04:03:54'] To be fair, Meta Quest avatar is indistinguishable from the original

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 07:46:49'] The cost is high and sales may start slow, but what AAPL has offered is a much clearer vision and roadmap for this technology. As tech improves and cost savings are realized, the costs with converge and AAPL‚Äôs vision will shine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:06:50'] vs. $0 do something useful instead
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:11:38'] This is a step for Apple, which is not their usual thing. This is a B2B product which will eventually lead to a B2C product that is smaller and cheaper.When that happens, you can expect Apple to explode with B2C AR/MX tech. This is just proof, that it isn't ready yet.Also, Meta is targeting VR more than AR/MX. AR/MX market is smartphone market size, VR is a niche tool for a niche market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:20:09'] ^(I hear a stampede of Karen‚Äôs coming in hot for Apple‚Äôs headset‚Ä¶their precious little angel just has to have one or else they‚Äôll need to speak to a manager!)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:37:44'] My opinion is that augmented reality isn't gonna take off until the gear we have to wear on our faces to enjoy it is made a helluva lot smaller... like stylish glasses. Google glass had the right idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:49:34'] I don't think many people here have played VR... yeah Meta sucks ass. But the headset itself is pretty wild. I just watched the NBA playoffs with it and it's Courtside like you're really there. The Meta Quest is 99.9% not anything like the right hand side.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:52:55'] This rollout reminds me somewhat of the first iPhone. At the time, it was expensive for a phone at $699 and did not come with a contract. It also had limited utility (no App Store, no picture messages), and ran on a slow network. But obviously over time, it was mass adopted and gained the features everyone wanted. Costs also came down via payment plans and 2 year contracts. I doubt sales will be terrific for the first gen Vision Pro, but this is a glimps into the future. There is room for both companeis to coexist and shine. People say no one needs a VR/AR headset, but those same people also said no one needs an iPhone in 2007. After all, we just need a phone that makes calls, right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 09:15:20'] Can't wait for a 3rd option..
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 09:22:13'] I think that overuse of these devices will have longer term consequences for peoples vision.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 10:00:05'] This is just dishonest trolling tbh OP. Compare codec avatars and then maybe you will see what apple showed mocked up is right down uncanny valley rather than realistic. I would rather have fully realistic avatars or completely cartoony ones - rather than what we saw in the demo which was super creepy.Not shitting on Apple - love that they're pushing the boundaries and tbh the price can be fair if they can indeed replace my MacBook as a new gen computing device. But this is just low effort OP
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 10:01:56'] I wanna punch the right one so bad

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 20:15:41'] Gang,  you're either gonna spend 350$ ON A PORN HEADSET, or 3500$ on another to do the exact same thing. Hands free is great because lube on the controllers is awful. Luckily, BOTH HEADSETS WORK W/ GESTURES. But, only one of them has a goddamn awful cord to knock over your wife's vase, and a clip on battery back. WHERE DO YOU CLIP IT WHEN YOU'RE BUTT- ASS NAKED ‚Äî YOUR SOCKS?  Look, I can see my fat ass just fine and waddle over to pick up my wife's old shirt \],and wipe my balls off with it, on either headset in 8k ‚Äî  the black and white passthrough 'display' in the Quest 2 is far more superior at helping me suspend the belief of my sad reality after I popped though, vs vibrant color, so I think i'll keep it.  Have fun trying to pudd it with apps from Apple‚Äî it's a just a strap-on Ted Lasso and Jar Jar Binks cuck device.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 00:04:42'] Yeah apple vision pro is magical
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 09:07:07'] Man, I dunno. I still feel like its a fad. I mean it was fun for a bit, but all the folks I know who have them, it's collecting dust now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 14:19:34'] Their VR is the most capable in the market with useful features no one else has, and Apples execution on software and eco system is excellent. This will be a slow burn which at some point will accelerate, may be a few years, by then their product will be matured to the point of excellent with both pro and affordable models.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:30:08'] In my opinion, iPhone is the most important piece of technology in civilization. It effectively managed to wrap the internet, camera, photo album, phone, phonebook, messages, email, flash light, music, calculator and so forth. All of that, in the palm of our hand. Kind of mind boggling to think about it. An idiot with an iPhone has infinitely more knowledge than say, Einstein. The possibilities and untapped value/potential waiting to be unlocked are endless. $3 trillion is preposterous but at the same time, it‚Äôs hard for me to disagree. Haven‚Äôt even talked about their other products or services. Not to mention the absurd amount of data at their disposal. We do EVERYTHING with our phones.It still hasn‚Äôt really tapped into AI and there‚Äôs a lot of undiscovered value. Particularly through the iPhone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 03:58:42'] US Critical Metals Corp (OTCMKTS: USCMF): I am optimistic on US Critical Metals Corp stock. US Critical Metals Corp is an exploration and development company focused on critical metals projects in North America. Critical metals, such as rare earth elements and lithium, are essential components in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and advanced technologies.

The company's strategic focus on North America provides access to regions with abundant mineral resources and a favorable regulatory environment. Additionally, US Critical Metals Corp's commitment to acquiring prospective mineral properties and advancing exploration efforts signals a dedication to growth and development. As the world transitions towards a cleaner and more sustainable future, the demand for critical metals is expected to rise significantly, creating opportunities for US Critical Metals Corp to capitalize on.Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL) Embraces my bullish sentiment. Apple, a prominent technology company, has consistently showcased its commitment to innovation and achieved remarkable success. Its extensive range of products, encompassing iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and wearables, has garnered a loyal customer base and contributes significantly to its growth potential. Apple's ecosystem, comprised of devices and services like the App Store and iCloud, generates substantial recurring revenue. The company's financial performance has been consistently impressive, characterized by steady revenue and profit growth. Moreover, Apple's robust brand and reputation for delivering high-quality products provide a competitive edge in the market. With its unwavering emphasis on technological advancements and ventures into new domains, Apple stands poised for long-term success.    Gamestop (NYSE: GME): Holds great promise from my perspective. The company has undergone a significant metamorphosis, implementing strategic initiatives that have instilled confidence and enthusiasm among investors. By embracing digital gaming and expanding its e-commerce capabilities, Gamestop has strategically positioned itself to take advantage of the flourishing digital gaming market. The company's extensive and devoted community of gamers presents a valuable asset as Gamestop leverages its brand and explores innovative ways to engage with customers. Noteworthy efforts by the management team to enhance cost efficiency, streamline operations, and fortify the company's financial position have yielded promising results. Furthermore, Gamestop stands poised to capitalize on emerging gaming trends like virtual reality and esports.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 20:43:54'] This is very common verbiage and just part of a Federal Banking Regulation. The 7 days has to do with the account type, not Apple or Goldman Sachs. You‚Äôd probably see something similar at any large bank. From the Federal Reserve:>Reservation of right to require advance notice of withdrawal. In order to classify an account as a "savings deposit," the account agreement between the depository institution and the customer must specify that the depository institution reserves the right at any time to require seven days' advance written notice of an intended withdrawal. **(As a practical matter, this right is rarely exercised.)**https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/regdcg.htmEdit: [Here is the deposit language for a CapitalOne account,](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/disclosures/savings-accounts/online-savings-account/) for example:>**Advance Notice of Withdrawal:** Under federal law, we must reserve the right to require you to give us at least 7 days written notice before you take money out of your account. (This hardly ever happens but legally we have to say it!)

If you‚Äôre looking to withdrawal multiple thousands of dollars in cash, like excess of $7k, then yes you may be required to wait. Sometimes they have it on hand, but they really just reserve the right to tell you no because they have to be able to serve their general populations cash needs. There are limits on what can be kept in a vault in order to limit the liability if the bank is ever robbed. No need to panic here!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 07:15:20'] It is a company over staffed considering it already hit a growth ceiling. 1000s employees are working to maintain a gadget like iWatch. It needs to downsize, remove middle management, let go dead wood. The manpower requirement for a service company is not the same as one developing and innovation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 06:29:00'] They don‚Äôt really have to.  Layoffs cost money.  You may give people a severance, there‚Äôs contracts to buy out, and there‚Äôs also the vacation time you have to pay for.  laying off each worker costs at LEAST $25kBut FANG companies are shit places to work.  People get out as soon as they can.  Typically a career at one of those places lasts 24 months and 25% annual turnover is about normal.So just don‚Äôt hire for 6 months and you‚Äôve reduced staff by 10% without paying for it.  And there‚Äôs for SURE a hiring freeze at all the FANG companies now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 06:56:15'] If there talking about it that means they plan on doing it.Apple is just another sham company most of it is made by easy access to consumers getting easy credit to get a iphone.  Credit is drying up. Banks are failing. Supply chains are slowing down since the beginning of the pandemic.  You also have city's like Chicago that can't keep stores because of theft.   To get a shiny new iPhone you need easy access to credit or lots of money. China had a huge problem making their iphones in China when the U.S. is not exactly on the best of terms politically.  At best here comes a temporary pump and dump. They fire employees revenues temporary increase and stock goes up temporarily and then stock falls back down to a real price.I hate layoffs it almost means that it is a temporary solution and at best they can just fire people and then ask for more loans from banks  or more credit from creditors who supply material etc. They didn't improve the company they just shuffled money around.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 06:34:43'] It's a fact that Apple is a great company. I worked for Apple in the '80s before it ever became a fraction of what it is today.Over my nearly 50 years of investing you could have put many other companies in this meme. For example, US steel, GM, general electric, Ford, IBM.My point is, Apple will be a great company until it isn't. It's inevitable that time will come. So we can be happy investors in Apple for now, but yes even Apple needs an exit strategy that suits your personal situation.I am only telling you this because I want you to stay a successful investor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 13:22:45'] I don't think PC is what Microsoft and Apple are after, AI applied to Services and Cloud, Mobile, Video Games, and Financing I think are the main businesses.Windows meant less than 30% of Microsoft' revenue in 2022  edit: Changed Windows for Microsoft, before "revenue in 2022"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 13:49:17'] for MSFT this is minor part of overall stats. Their bread and butter is SAAS/Cloud revenue. We will know how things are in couple of weeks. Their diversity of revenue base makes them a compelling company for long term.Apple earnings will suck. But its still highly profitable which is having 70B an year revenue on subscriptions. Just not selling enough macs or ipads is not a huge red flag. But this will force them to launch the next big thing(MR headset) before its mature for sure. I am expect tepid reactions though Apple is playing the long game  here in getting software ecosystem getting built for future releases. That said beyond all the above I see flight to safety for companies which have huge moat. AAPL and MSFT fit in that bracket for sure.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 15:24:14'] That is a very narrow field of view to see Microsoft and Apple as purely PC manufacturers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 15:59:27'] Because only 10% of their revenue came from Macs and a little over 50% of nearly 400 billion came from iPhones. It‚Äôs a drop in the bucket to companies like apple and Microsoft that make money in other ways not just PCs
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 13:23:12'] specifically for apple, 'wearables' make up a huge part of their business lately. this chart is number of ships and doesn't make any mention of margins or costs. microsoft also has a lot of products other than shipping PCs. both companies could also be cutting labor/costs, etc. also, stock price is based on perceived value that someone is willing to buy at and, essentially, is not directly tied to fundamentals of the business in a strict sense. should it be? yes, but it is not that simple.what is hard to understand? do you have a more specific question?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 04:54:56'] Flight to safety ironically means in this case that some of that is bonds and money market securities but also faang stocks that are cash cows with rock solid businesses. Taking into account that the broad market in the US has a large weighting towards these stocks, it becomes clear why the market hasn‚Äôt entirely tanked. Big faang stocks are keeping the broad market from dropping another 20% and as soon as those stocks dump again on bad numbers(assuming this even happens) the market will dump again. At this point my guess is we have a soft landing in the economy and the stock market has already bottomed or is close to it and we will more or less consolidate for a while until economic indicators get better.OrrrrrrWe keep raising interest rates blindly until we see the whites of inflations eyes and then theres some sort of unforeseen event(possible credit driven) that tanks the US economy and takes the big faang stocks with it:)Edit: obviously there‚Äôs a million different ways this could play out but it seems like there‚Äôs really only a few ways this is likely to go. J Powell has postured himself to be like Volker and he intentionally yanked the economy to reign in inflation so at this point I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 15:09:22'] Apple is responsible for a huge portion, possibly a majority of the smartphone market, with many people opting to buy a new iPhone each year. There's also the revenue from accessories such as the apple watch and airpods, and services such as apple music and the appstore. I'm going to assume that like most other streaming services, Apple TV+ may not be a strong revenue steam at the momentMicrosoft has never really been big on PCs. They've been a software company for as far as I can remember that happens to have a select few devices. I'm less versed in AAPLs business, but MSFT has a pretty large portfolio when it comes to SaS. They're responsible for Azure, Office 365, XBox Gamepass, Visual Studio, among others. There's also the Bing GPT search which they're developing which seems like it could be a promising competitor to Google's search engine.

P/E is completely disconnected from their growth because WS can‚Äôt make a DCF that makes any sense, their PEG ratio is one of the lowest out there and they get punished for 36% YoY growth when Mac sales are down 40% during the same period.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 22:14:19'] It's not hard. The market needs to be propped up, so you pump the top names with the highest ETF % of shares.When you're done buying puts at the top, you sell that trash, fuck everyone and make big money.

POST_TEXT: b'I looked for recent news about it, but I just found some prudent comments on AI by Tim Cook, and some hints to some undergoing effort to integrate generative AI into Siri, but without much information. Apple seems to have disappeared from the hype and news, after the AI question recently started to be taken into high consideration by all the other major tech parties.  \nI know Apple recently tried to expand in the financial sector with its savings account, but does it really think its future lies in banking?\n\nDo you think the stock is about to suffer mid-term from this? Or, conversely, do you think they have some new secret project up their sleeve to be announced briefly which could turn the tables around?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 02:48:09'] Apples been advancing in AI for a while without advertising it much at all. [Heres an article](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-neural-engine-how-does-it-work/) about the neural engine in the M series chips and how it is used within the Apple ecosystem

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 12:25:23'] Siri is a pile of shit so I‚Äôd imagine far behind. I‚Äôm not really sure it matters. People are addicted to their products and their buybacks are massive
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 03:02:14'] Apple always comes latest but comes best
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 05:47:45'] Amazon, Google and Apple have the most consumer data BY FAR and most highly adopted AI voice assistants that continue to train models and produce more data.  Data is the oil of the new world and I strongly believe AMZN, Google, and Apple are going to be big winners.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 03:51:47'] Everyone needs a computer to run AI. Apple makes the best mobile computers on the planet and they are about to release the next iteration with AR glasses. Unless someone else starts making better mobile computers, Apple will always be in the middle of things.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 07:36:32'] Not much public info on it yet. I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs strategic and intentional. I think they will unveil a consumer AI product at some point when this little AI craze ends, possibly even an exclusive feature on the next big iPhone release in the next few years. Apple only knows top notch consumer products so I imagine it will be a game changer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 09:12:40'] Cook is a technical person. He is aware the lack of progress in AI after 67 years of research and lack of progress even with concentrated 4 billion dollar development by one of the largest computer companies over 1-decade long time span.  I believe Siri with AI enhancement added will help. But it is not something Apple will brag about it right now. It could speed things up in search or image recognition in the co-processors someday.  Right now, iPhone thinks my son and grandsons are same person since they look similar. So it is not there yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 03:26:13'] The only AI Apple has is Siri and it‚Äôs pretty terrible. The issue is profitability: what exactly is the revenue that Apple would generate from investing in AI? Are AI assistants the main asking point for a phone or software and apps more compelling?Why would Apple Compete with OpenAI or Bard when it‚Äôs not a revenue generating stream? Integrating AI into Google Search can make search better. Integrating generative AI makes into Office makes a better platform. Does generative AI really make your smartphone that much better? Plus, Apple is happy with their 30% take on your subscriptions. Even if it did, just use Google Services. Hell, Apple is literally paid money by Google to make Google the default. There‚Äôs zero reason to enter this market.Honestly, getting into banking makes a whole Hell of a lot more sense for Apple than generative AI. It doesn‚Äôt add anything to their product portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 07:49:12'] Genuine question: How would AI be implemented in Apple? Also to add on to the stock trending lower because of not mentioning anything about AI. Yes,it most likely will but also Apple tends to perfect anything they get into so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they pull out something really cool later on that has AI in it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 18:01:00'] Apple never chase trend, they wait in the dark, learn from other companies mistake and release a better product. Not saying it‚Äôs the best way or you should enjoy their products, it‚Äôs just their business model
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 23:07:23'] >Do you think the stock is about to suffer mid-term from this?Probably going up
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 05:18:34'] No matter what all these comments say, we just don't know.  Just like with everything Apple, they'll release stuff when they're ready, with few or no leaks in the mean time. And anything that does leak, should be taken with a huge grain of salt... just remember that leaer who got his sister fired last week by Apple's disinformation campaigns that they use to find leakers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 01:24:00'] In terms of the AI race, Apple is nowhere near the first two (Microsoft and Google/Alphabet) and yes the company and its stock will probably suffer mid- to long-term for this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 17:13:41'] I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with tech and large software companies but all the big tech companies have had AI for years in all sorts of places that you may or may not noticed or seen. Microsoft made a bet on a smaller company which created a way for normal people to engage directly with their latest and greatest AI and packaged it up real nice. People are excited about this, but I don‚Äôt think it fundamentally changes the direction of these businesses. Rather than trying to make something up or rush something out, I think Apple has correctly calculated that while AI is on the top of everyone‚Äôs mind, they do not need to change the course of their business or rush some product to market just because it‚Äôs hot. It sort of reminds me of blockchain or metaverse from the last few years. The difference is that AI already exists and is being put to use all around us in a lot of ways that you probably just never directly interacted with the way that you can with ChatGPT. That said, as long as there is consumer appetite and money to be made then I‚Äôm sure you will see some kind of interactive AI start to be incorporated more and more into some of the software you already use. So to answer your question, they‚Äôre probably just as far along as everyone else, but you just don‚Äôt directly interact with and at this point it doesn‚Äôt seem like Apple is going to change their business plans to create something new just because it is the new hot thing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 23:59:58'] TLDR. An appeals court on Monday mostly sided with Apple over its App Store rules in a suit with Epic Games.The decision signals that Apple‚Äôs control over the App Store and the fees it charges likely won‚Äôt significantly change as a result of an ongoing legal challenge by Epic Games.However, the iPhone maker did lose one claim and had to allow developers to place links inside their apps so users could make purchases outside the App Store.

I‚Äôm fairly certain various online platforms charge similar and if people think the chinese tat being peddled on amazon doesn‚Äôt have a fair bit of mark up on it, they‚Äôre kidding themselves. People make stuff, you sell it, you take a cut. That‚Äôs how commerce works. They reduce it for smaller companies with sub $1m of sales i think.I wonder what mark up there is on after market tesla parts?I‚Äôm not an apple fanboy, but listening to elon musk whining about capitalism as world‚Äôs richest man, is nauseating. All this ‚Äúapple hates free speech‚Äù is nonsense too. Apple are exercising their right to give business to whoever they want and let‚Äôs be honest. Who wants to advertise on a platform where you have every chance of sharing it with a bunch of racist bigots now moderation is essentially not a thing anymore
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 05:43:18'] How do they have an illegal monopoly on app stores?  Can you not choose to purchase an android phone and not use apple App Store?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 06:40:56'] What platform/marketplace that allows others to sell their goods/services doesn't?Honestly, tell me one that doesn't charge a 'tax' similar to this and I'll eat my hat.Musk was boasting that, because of twitter blue, he'll be able to pay Twitter content creators '10% more' than YouTube when using his platform to distribute their content.So he'll be taxing 20% on creators income (youtube 30%) so long as twitter blue is successful enough. Why? because it's not fucking free to host/maintain this portion of the platform.If Twitter Blue isn't as successful as they need it to be? That 20% will absolutely become 30%.In the same way, Apple's app store is a fucking platform to sell your items. It's not free to run and will never be free to use. They aren't even taxing *everyone* like other platforms are... just those who make over $1m annually from the sale of their app on the app store. If you sell a good/service on another companies platform you're going to pay a 'tax'. Every single one does this. Whether it be through rev share or up front in points if you sell a good. I just don't get it. If anything, Apple is rather generous by not charging the first $1m you make annually.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 07:38:11'] Spotify dropping from appstore would be one of apple's wet dream...more people on Apple Music...Edit: I read the comments and people are misunderstanding what apple's product is. The iphone is just part of the product. Apple's biggest advantage over its competitors is their software. Their hardware is shitty as it gets, but their software is made to use 100% of those shitty hardware resources and be less vulnerable as possible. Appstore is, in a certain way, part of the safety measures that apple imposes on its users to not allow easy bloatware or malicious software to be installed on their system. This is a thing the play store doesnt have. I am all in for allowing more user choices here, but apple should  be able to make the user liable for damages caused by malicious software in case it is downloaded through other means not native to the IOS.

I think people are more willing to give up twitter or spotify than give up their phone, especially when a large portion of the customer base for iPhones are ride-or-die with Apple.

The whole injection of freedumb-based political talking points is super bizarre, Apple's entire business plan is a walled garden - this is like Microsoft suing Sony for charging fees for sales on the Playstation Store, and why it will never succeed in court.Bonus: Why do Apple customers act like the entire world runs on Apple products? Their marketing is legendary because it makes their users think they're the majority when they're really a captive audience being fleeced with products designed around predatory and systematic overcharging.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 08:49:32'] When you‚Äôve spent billions on something you have no idea how to run and start losing money, you start blaming Apple‚Äôs 30% cut that, albeit too much IMO, has been a known variable before he offered to buy Twitter. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù, especially after the much publicized Epic battle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 08:57:36'] Isn't this something that is disclosed to applications with high use? It can't be a sudden surprise that Apple takes a 30% cut.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 08:59:44'] I find it funny to call it a monopoly when there are other smartphones on the market, that also have their own market places. Twitter runs on android OS, on Samsung and Google phones. If apple removes it and people want Twitter so badly, they can buy another manufacturers phone. That proves it‚Äôs not a monopoly. These bad faith arguments are exhausting.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 09:17:33'] For starters it‚Äôs not a monopoly - it‚Äôs a duopoly. Secondly, we should look at the way that Tesla operates with right to repair and software patches at the same time.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/10anw1a/apple_ceo_tim_cooks_compensation_cuts_by_40_in/'
POST_TEXT: b'Apple is cutting Tim Cooks compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.\n\nDespite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.\n\nComparing with other executives, Cooks compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre OBrien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.\n\nThis is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole'

And if the stars align, Tim will be introducing the Fully Autonomous Apple Car in 2025. The compensation agreement is to make sure he follows through this year.

The iPhone accounted for 11 per cent of secondary smartphone sales in India last year, up from 3 per cent in 2021, making it the fastest-growing refurbished brand in India, according to data from Counterpoint Research, a market intelligence group.  Apple has pinned its hopes for future growth on India as the US tech giant looks to ramp up its share of the worlds third-largest smartphone market.  Chief executive Tim Cook met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April as it opened the companys first two Apple stores in the country. The iPhone maker is also building up its nascent manufacturing operations in India as it looks to unwind its dependence on China.

I guess the one advantage it has is that users wouldn‚Äôt need to keep paying for sensors or would require insurance or prescriptions which I guess would be good for folks that are borderline diabetic or just want to monitor their blood glucose out of caution but don‚Äôt medically need to and so don‚Äôt want to be forking out extra money.I wear a Libre 3 sensor. It‚Äôs the size of a nickel and barely noticeable on my upper arm. It‚Äôs on me 24/7 (for 2 weeks before needing to be replaced). Doesn‚Äôt need to be charged in those two weeks and is continuously sending information to my phone (and i think it can also send the info to your smartwatch). My phone rings if my sugar is too high or too low (which is great for diabetics scared of not waking up by themselves during a hypoglycaemic event in the middle of the night). The ‚Äúinvasiveness‚Äù of it needing to a have a little wire in my skin is not even noticeable (apart from a little pinch that lasts 10 seconds upon application). Of course if it could be even smaller, that would always be nicer but I really can‚Äôt complain.I wouldn‚Äôt want to rely on an Apple Watch for my glucose monitoring. An Apple Watch needs to be charged regularly. It‚Äôs way bulkier than the sensor on my arm. I‚Äôd have to wear it all the time (playing sports or sleeping or when showering) to get to the same level of monitoring coverage.

POST_TEXT: b'After Apple announces its plan to replace chips from Broadcom and Qualcomm before 2025, news told that Apple is going to shift away from Samsung by designing and making in-house screens starting 2024.\n\nApple has been planning to do this shift since 2018, but the work has been delayed due to high cost and technical challenges. Now Apple still sees it as one of the companys most critical projects. Apple spent about $26 billion on research and development in fiscal 2022 and devoted several billion dollars so far to the effort. The company operates a 62,000-square-foot facility in Santa Clara, California to conduct test manufacturing of the screens.\n\nAlthough the determination is real, this 2024 target could potentially slip until 2025, some people involved in the project said. But the company also could just offer a limited supply of the new devices to get the transition started. In near term, Apple Watch could be the first product to install the new displays.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:09:11'] My guess is antitrust issues. It also made more sense financially to just fund them vs. buying them out. I think Apple is definitely exploring ways to provide untethered connectivity. As a world traveler, I‚Äôd love nothing more than having one company handle all my wireless needs. It starts with emergencies and short connectivity until a network of low orbiting satellites with high speeds can be built out. That would be the dream.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 17:50:36'] Chapter 8: The Investor and Market Fluctuations    In this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of staying calm and rational in the face of market fluctuations. He argues that investors should focus on the long-term and not be swayed by short-term market movements. He also introduces the concept of "Mr. Market," who represents the market's irrational behavior. Graham advises investors to treat Mr. Market like a manic-depressive uncle, and to only buy stocks when he is offering them at a bargain price.    Chapter 20: The Defensive Investor and the Speculator    In this chapter, Graham discusses the difference between an investor and a speculator. He defines an investor as someone who buys a stock because they believe it is a good value, and a speculator as someone who buys a stock because they believe the price will go up. Graham argues that investors should focus on buying stocks that are undervalued, and that speculators should only speculate with money they can afford to lose.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 11:12:43'] Last week we saw workers clash with police over at Foxconn over delayed bonus payments and working conditions related to covid 19 And on Thursday employees began an exodusFoxconn essentially said they had an input error in the computer system where they were giving new hires contracts for existing workers and that new recruits would be paid what was promised to themSo Foxconn offered up these disgruntled protesting employees 10,000 yuan or about $1,400 in two installment payments to anyone who wanted to leave to ease tensions.So now they have to replace the workers who decided to take the severance pay. This is worrisome because apple had already announced they would be seeing some delays. This way about 3 weeks ago. So now we‚Äôre seeing more issues in capacity over at Foxconn right around the holidays.Keep in mind Apple is a large weight in ETF like QQQ and SPYQQQ: 12.51%SPY: 7.07%Now to make this entire covid situation worse, we have these protest in xinjiang after a deadly fire in an apartment building killed 10 people. To elaborate on this, firefighters took longer to arrive to the scene because of covid 19 barricades and parked electric vehicles in narrow pathways that had lost power.Now let‚Äôs talk about the crayon drawing.Support: 138ishResistance: 150ish50 day moving average: 146.53200 day moving average: 154.60Demand zone (green box): 127 to around 138, this is where you see people buyingSupply zone(red box) : around 158 to 150, this is where you see people sellingRight now, we‚Äôre sandwiched between the 50 day and the 200 day and if we lose the 50 day, we risk hitting the bottom support trend line. The first chart is showing a 10-year 1 day time frame.The top and bottom trendlines ‚Äúthicker red crayon lines‚Äù create a pennant. On the second chart, I show a shorter time frame. 30-day 30-minute time frame. You can see the rejections off the top trend line a little clearer. We had 3 rejections more recently. Also if we fall out of the pennant, we risk closing the gap we made a few days ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 16:32:17'] Does this include all Apple profit or just profit from iPhone sales?  If all sales, this is very misleading because of apples high margin software/App Store business
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 18:13:00'] So 14% volume but 80% profits? That just means it's massively overpriced. If there's one thing Apple has done well, it's marketing & psychology. They have managed to convince consumers that their overpriced phones are worth it. I know several people alone who switched to iPhone for the sole reason of having the correct color bubble on their friend's texting app.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 06:28:09'] It's all a hedonistic party for these extremely overpriced gadget salesman... until the music suddenly ends.Anyone remember a little company by the name of Blackberry?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 06:55:40'] Charts without base assumptions in the notes aren't reliable, likely misleading.Anyway, part of Apple's moat is anchored in having superior user experience, fluidity, ease to use, ease to update, ease to transfer data, aesthetics, despite lower specs, and a bit (a lot) of status around it, which means their products are conceived to be strict, not for everyone.If products are meant to be for a selected public, they will never pursue market share (amid phone market) as a primary goal. The same way is for any status brand. What makes sense for Apple is to seek market share amid high-end phone market, as the whole market targets a selected public.For the overall phone market, what makes sense is to seek profit margin, which kind of endorses the pareto of the charts (although not sure if they are properly representing the reality).

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 02:15:36'] No way this makes sense, would like to see some actual proof (numbers) to back this up. The website this is reposted from doesn‚Äôt show any numbers either.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 20:03:35'] Does anyone else feel like Apple will have a colossal fall within the next few years or so? I feel like every new iPhone, tablet, laptop, or accessory that they produce is essentially the same thing offering no advantage to buying an older version. Also they already have a good majority of their market cornered, so how much more can this company grow? Other than the cashflow generated from Apple Music and other subscription services I don‚Äôt see how Apple wouldn‚Äôt have a tremendous fall within the next few years or so. Jobs set this business up for ultimate success, but how much longer does this company have before the fumes start running out?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 20:08:42'] People don‚Äôt realize how difficult this stuff is. One false move by either Apple or (especially) Samsung could spell the end for their respective company; maybe not immediately, but that‚Äôs the trajectory. I‚Äôve seen this many times with other companies, and the first one to get overly confident and greedy usually ends up bankrupt. Compete, don‚Äôt copy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:21:48'] They‚Äôve been paying back shareholders in dividends and buybacks. The more they give back the lower book value would be compared to paying off debt and holding cash
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 15:02:44'] Price to book is not always a meaningful metric. A company like apple is valued by their profits or free cash flow rather than book value. If a couple has declining or negative profits and an extremely strong balance sheet. A good portion of their value might be from their book value. However, that doesn‚Äôt not apply to apple or any of their peer companies
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 11:28:56'] It‚Äôs grossly overvalued. The Covid years screwed valuation on a lot of shit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:26:59'] Because you pay a large premium for its equity, it being the largest tech company in the world. Its also what makes it a bit dangerous to own for the long-run, atleast in my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 22:15:24'] Let me key you in on a little secret that so many people seem unable to comprehend. The price movement you are seeing is bullshit. It's algorithmic buying and selling and short selling to manipulate the price so big money can buy up more stock when it bottoms out. NEVER trade with your emotions. Do your homework, and trust your gut, validate your price points and stick with it. And FFS don't listen to most of trolls around here. Have you seen how broke they are? I mean look at the dumb shit that consistently comes out of their mouths. 99% of these post are total trash. I've seen 10 year olds say more intelligent things. If you trust them, you're asking to go broke just like they are.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 05:57:18'] Nvidia is trading at 10x sales. Meaning they would have to pay you every dollar that they make for ten years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 22:58:01'] So, with Rosenblatt's $600.00 price target for Nvidia, let me say this. Nvidia's PE ratio is lower today than it was before earnings were reported. Over the next ten years, this company will experience rapid growth. Because of their rapid revenue growth, they will reach the $600.00 price target sooner than most expect. As previously stated, they control 80% of the global market. So, from an investment standpoint, this is a buy, which is why roughly two dozen analysts have raised their price targets. As I previously stated, 600.00 will arrive quickly in the coming months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:26:25'] Agreed, at what point do people just give up being wrong? Like ya, eventually it will pull back hard, but in the meantime it‚Äôs ripping higher and bears are only losing money. That must be difficult to cope with tbh

The first batch of downgrades or price target cuts usually comes before earning releases every quarter - so 4 times in a year, before earnings, watch for downgrades and price target cuts due to demand weakness.The second batch of cuts or downgrades come after the  release of latest iPhones - and the usual reasons for the downgrades or price target cuts per analysts are softening demand or weaknesses per analysts ‚ÄúChannel checks‚Äù . You know the story from Analysts are always the same for apple - ‚Äúsoftening demand or weakness‚Äù and nothing new The story from apple is always ‚Äú more money, because people will buy anything we slap apple logos on‚Äù If you have held apple longer, your will notice that these downgrades and prices target cuts are not new, but the algos seems to fall for it all the time and sell the stocks .

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 16:08:44'] The repurchase of the common stock is a good thing. It is clear that they believe that the shares are undervalued and it's a good opportunity to buy them back. Otherwise you will allocate the money elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 02:35:09'] Cash flow statement is arguably the most important yet most under appreciated financial statements of all 3 statements of a company. It reveals a lot of business insights that an income statement or a balance sheet can not. Unlike income statement which everyone looks at, it's much harder to fudge numbers on a cash flow statement. So here I breakdown Apple's cash flow statement with this simple visualisation. It's a highly cash generative business!

A COVID outbreak at the facility has lead to a mass evacuation of personnel.  Video has appeared online for several days showing thousands of Foxconn workers walking along highways to return to their home towns.  They are not allowed on buses or trains because they are designated as "close contacts" under China's strict anti-pandemic health code system.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:19:03'] The main issue I see from Apple is their capacity for growth. The smartphone market is maxed out, they are already the leader in tablets, MacBooks and their other computer lineups can have decent growth but that was never a huge earner for them, wareables have a hard time catching on and people are much less likely to update then regularly. The biggest new growth I see is from web services like apple tv which has some decent shows. The problem is that they're so big already that even if it's a huge success it's a small increase in earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 06:11:17'] Is that math correct? A 1% tax should reduce the boost to EPS by around 1%, no?A 3.5% reduction to 2.5% reduction implies a drop of 29% to the EPS boost. Doesn‚Äôt seem to check out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 06:18:11'] Maybe they will finally boost their dividends!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 05:11:03'] Good this tax is long overdue and stock buybacks do nothing but manipulate a company‚Äôs price per share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 08:44:49'] It means these companies will have to start paying their employees in money instead of in stock.Much of the buyback programs is to prevent dilution from employee issuances
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 06:00:01'] Apple has much smarter and creative people who can do laps around the lawmakers. They will surely find ways to circumvent this tax and continue to reward shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 14:54:02'] Buy backs are a problem when the companies get bailout money from the government and use it to buy back stock.. otherwise, they can the cash they are sitting on in whatever ways they want to.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 17:58:33'] Buybacks have gotten out of control especially when funded by debt. Look at Boeing. They were on the brink of bankruptcy because they funded their buyback program with debt. Boeing had negative book value and asked for a government bailout when the pandemic started. When the government asked for an equity stake Boeing declined and borrowed more money in the credit market after the Fed started buying corporate bonds and saved the credit markets. Boeings bond holders essentially own its assets now. Should it have another crisis they will be back asking the government for a bailout. We can‚Äôt allow these big companies to destabilize their finances for the primary purpose of corporate officer enrichment and then claim they are too big too fail and need a government bailout.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 18:09:38'] Here is the one issue with Apple I can see from this chart. 52 percent of revenue is the iPhone. That means all it would take is one major fuck up with their flagship product and its in trouble. I don't see this happening but strangers things have before.

If you think overpaying for apple's growth at the price it is, will continue to net you market beating share appreciation for another 5-10yrs, go right ahead. I wouldn't touch it until it goes a good bit lower. You want to buy revenue/cash flow/profit for as cheap as possible. S&P 500 continually readjusts itself, APPL is just APPL. What happens when the shine wears off, and the growth slows because of regulations preventing acquisitions quick enough? What happens when people start to hold on to their phones just slightly longer due to the price increases on the "Apple Premium"?Always buy at the price that makes sense to maximize your long term return. $APPL at $150 is not what I would consider a good price personally, even based on the FCF and other fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 20:43:25'] Apple‚Äôs biggest challenge in the medium term, imo, is going to be AR/VR race with Meta. Recent reports have suggested that Tim Cook hardly meets XR teams and they are getting deprioritized support from other core firmware teams. This is very worrying. If AR does become a high growth consumer product segment in next 3-4 years then Apple needs to have a strong product to compete. And a lot of people underestimate the technology breakthroughs that would be needed to get there. The feeling amongst a lot of industry observers today is that Meta‚Äôs dominance will be over when lever Apple launches their product. It sounds a lot like what a lot of experts said about Tesla in 2015-2020 timeframe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 21:06:00'] 15 Years in the Electronics industry. Apple is like a wrecking ball.  Network effects from iMessage, iCloud, iPad adoption and the moat just keeps slowly widening before competitors realize it's too late. With that being said, they are diving into businesses that are capital intensive and yield little retention... I'm looking at Apple Arcade and Apple TV. But if history is any indicator this could be building the base for something massive over the next 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 04:09:39'] I do really like Apple.  But I do lke Google better.  They are growing faster.  They have multiple moats. But the biggest thing is that Google has so many assets yet to be fully moentized and that just creates a world class runway to work with.

Every one of their devices is so reliable. Even if you‚Äôre an android user, you cannot deny apple is in its own lane since there is no other company like them. They create wireless headphones like no other company, watches and tablets are the BEST in the market. Just my opinion tho.

Helps you navigate on trips and drive better.Helps you find your stuff if you lose it. Gives your instructions for tasks like cooking.Provide additional information on landmarks, restaurants, and any other places you want to go.Provide overlaid schematics and instructions for fixing appliances or equipment.Record your day, transcribe a presentation, translate a foreign language.Fuck this VR nonsense, give me AR.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 04:50:39'] Am I the only one that was actually impressed by Zuckberg knowledge on the podcasts he went to? I thought he was an Alien or something but he actually spoke about the competition VRchat, secondlife and whatnot.Apart from that. I actually believe Meta has evolved the tech and people aren't looking past the lackluster graphics. The expression reading technology is impressive and I believe it is the next evolution. Who else remembers went the hand controllers showed up and all the people went on with the hand gesture humour. Facial expressions are the next level! Maybe I'm seeing it wrong and people are a bunch of uncharismatic NPCs and and rather be expressionless avatars that spam air emojis or whatever emojis become rather than having IRL expressions crossover to the "metaverse". But for me, it is the next level, the death of the emojis, a revolution in online chatting.I was watching LTT video and when he said "Oh right, there is facial tracking, I probably shouldn't be making this face." that was when I realised the revolution inbound.I understand they have spent more money than NASA spent to send men to the moon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 05:22:35'] Microsoft is one of the most valuable companies in the world and has less revenue than amzn, aapl, and alph. This makes me even more bullish on Microsoft. If they continue growing their revenue, their earnings will possibly be at the same margins as currently

One of the most used OSes, a popular console, one of the most popular enterprise software suites, hardware and more.Feels like they haven‚Äôt yet managed to scale their revenues, but at the same time they‚Äôre one of the older tech companies‚Äîthey‚Äôve had the time.A lot of MSFTs offering is software, which is traditionally easier to scale. But I guess they haven‚Äôt managed to properly take that one step further to properly leverage their baseline with a stronger ecosystem effect.

Amazon will have a tough time maintaining its profits with less people spending this year (long term wise should be good). Google seems strongest of the lot (biggest threat is their advertising - regulations in EU. However remember their apps like YouTube gmail android etc is used a lot everywhere in the world).

AWS is their most profitable revenue stream because it costs so little and makes so much. Businesses are willing to pay more than consumers and AWS faces less competition. I think it might be better to break down profits by category

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nNeonode is a technology company that asserts it invented the touch function. They hold patents 993 and 879 for this technology. Recently, Neonode emerged victorious in an IPR (Inter Partes Review) against both Apple and Samsung, with the judge ruling that Neonode's invention was a commercial success and had prior art in patent 879. Additionally, Neonode was granted a win in an IPR using the same patent against Alphabet. This means that their patent is not unpatentable, and they have a valid case against any company using touchscreen technology.\n\nIf they win in court, the potential outcome in terms of damages could reach billions of dollars. This is based on a previous contract between Neonode and Samsung, in which Samsung agreed to pay 2 euros per unit, thereby acknowledging Neonode's patent on the technology. This could result in triple damages.\n\nIf Neonode prevails in court against these tech giants, they could potentially sue other technology companies that produce products using"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 20:49:16'] 2022 total EV production was around 800k. Tesla was around 550k of that 800k. In 2023 they are estimated to produce around 1.2 million car. More than double. They are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. In comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That‚Äôs per company. There isn‚Äôt a company that can produce at Tesla‚Äôs speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it‚Äôs going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That‚Äôs 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that‚Äôs a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. I know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. Tesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That‚Äôs 14 years. That‚Äôs millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla. By the time the other companies catch up it will be too late. Tesla is KING!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 06:46:30'] I can sort of see why. A lot of excellent tech investors/managers have been caught off guard by Apple‚Äôs success. I speak to them as part of my job and I‚Äôll always ask why you don‚Äôt hold Apple bla bla. Benchmark contributed 1/2/3% from Apple bla bla. The core reason is that Apple have been able to raise prices on their electronics hardware, countering most expectations. No one thought consumers would buy a ¬£$‚Ç¨1000 phone, but we sure did. Even when losing market share in #devices vs. Android etc, they‚Äôre still able to retain  sticky base of users with high propensity to spend. Just a very simple overview from me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-17 14:27:32'] This is my interpretation of his move.. Apple has had it's success because people pay their highly priced phones which generate great margins for the company. I assume many people buy their phones on some form of credit.&#x200B;We're now entering what is - at least up to some point - an unprecedented level of inflation & inflationary pressures on every day consumers. Mix that in with a supply-side crisis and a tightening of monetary policy to reign-in the inflation then we may see sales dramatically slump at some point this year. It may not even be sales that slump entirely.. but consumers may turn their back on this years generation of high-end luxury phone, watch etc. (opting for the cheaper and lower margin base iphone 13 or the older generation for example)&#x200B;tldr: Less money, harder to get credit/finance = less sales & apple for a long time now has been good on sales which in hand gave it it's high intrinsic value (my thoughts anyway)

Positions are very basic.. Every retirement fund involved in municipal jobs and union trades all hold these and acquire more or less of one or the other from time to time! Timing is everything when shorting the largest market cap companies in rhe world, we shall see. My daughter's trust is up 303% since rolling over my 457 and all profits from options on Gamestop. I use them to protect the $4.2m I amassed in the last 20months

Intellectual property theft is rampant. They have no real moat should China make a move on Taiwan. China could then easily make their own knockoff iphones kind of like how Russia basically seized all the McDonald's restaurants there and just kept operating them.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple reportedly warned suppliers not to use \'made in Taiwan\' labels on products to avoid angering China following Nancy Pelosi\'s visit\n\nApple told suppliers on Friday to avoid labeling products from Taiwan as "made in Taiwan," according to a report from Nikkei.\n\nThe tech company told its suppliers that products or parts made in Taiwan must be identified as made either in "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei" to avoid indicating that the island is independent of China, the Japanese business news outlet said.\n\nAccording to Nikkei, Apple made the decision in order to avoid possible supply chain disruptions from Chinese scrutiny over the labels, especially as the company prepares to receive components from Taiwan that will be used for new products slated to launch later this year.\n\nSome iPhone components were held for review on Thursday to see whether the shipments were labeled to China\'s satisfaction, Nikkei reported.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to Insider\'s request for comment ahea'

To be honest chinas market share should be way bigger than that with the amount of people they have. In terms of ratio, china‚Äôs market share and its economic size should be immensely bigger than what it is by now. Its quite the opposite actually their market share and economy size is very small for the 1.4 billion population they have. Says a lot of their capabilities and performance per head. If the US had 1.4 billion people then the output would be 10-12 times of what it is now totally dwarfing China‚Äôs 1.4 billion output.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 14:09:59'] It doesn't seem like mutch. I have to wonder how the tresury auctions next week will affect behavior going forward. It seems like the FEDs new window prevents rug pull withdrawal. I still haven't heard anything on the closed door meetings, and we started the weekend with crazy bear stories from nukes in Belarus (Zerohedge sucks) to the dominos hitting DB and maybe C Schwab (TDAmeritrade). All this after a seller exhaustion induced rip to recovery over the course of Friday. This is maybe strange, but I'm going to have confidence in the market if we break down to spy386 over the first half of next week with tresuries losing a quarter. However, we could rip sooner if the fed announces cheap financing to the government to cover the cost of fallout that has taken place. However, if they announce something like that early, that rip will pull money out of treasuries and possibly exacerbate the situation.So I suppose I will position myself for what I think will be wise choices by our leaders while preparing myself to be wrong and quick to acknowledge it. What are your thoughts?

When it comes to cloud computing:  There are any number of AI services from security, chat bots, targeted advertising, etc that Amazon maybe paying another company to do for them that eventually they can do for themselves and continue to vertically integrate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 17:24:18'] Kind of concerned that Tesla is not doing more R&D considering that they are a pioneer leading the field.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 20:12:45'] That‚Äôs why they not improving any more. Tesla just selling their old product and expect people to buy it. :) sooner or later more advanced and developed cars will take over them. Hyundai is a good example , rnd is important.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 17:45:52'] I sold 50% of NVDA, even though I believe in it long term, the valuation is pretty wild right now.  I‚Äôd suggest you trim some as well.  Maybe add a little BRKB with your profits.  You also could get most of what you are already holding with VGT.

Throw in some space exploration autonomous mobility or something like this if u want real growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:37:46'] Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share.However, Apple came up short versus revenue expectations in core product categories including the company‚Äôs iPhone business and services.Apple shares fell over 4% at one point in extended trading before recovering.Here is how Apple did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:* EPS $1.29 vs. $1.27 est.* Revenue. $90.15 billion vs. $88.90 billion estimated, up 8.1% year-over-year* iPhone revenue: $42.63 billion vs. $43.21 billion estimated, up 9.67% year-over-year* Mac revenue: $11.51 billion vs. $9.36 billion estimated, up 25.39% year-over-year* iPad revenue: $7.17 billion vs. $7.94 billion estimated, down 13.06% year-over-year* Other Products revenue: $9.65 billion vs. $9.17 billion estimated, up 9.85% year-over-year* Services revenue: $19.19 billion vs. $20.10 billion estimated, up 4.98% year-over-year* Gross margin: 42.3% vs. 42.1% estimatedApple did not provide official guidance for its first fiscal quarter, which ends in December and contains Apple‚Äôs biggest sales season of the year. It hasn‚Äôt provided guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty.Apple increased revenue by 8% during the quarter, and Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that it would‚Äôve grown ‚Äúdouble-digits‚Äù if not for the strong dollar. Total sales in Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2022 were up 8% to $394.3 billion.‚ÄúThe foreign exchange headwinds were over 600 basis points for the quarter,‚Äù Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach. ‚ÄúSo it was significant. We would have grown in double digits without the foreign exchange headwinds.‚ÄùCook told CNBC that Apple had slowed the pace of its hiring. Other tech companies are looking to make cuts ahead of a possible recession and as interest rates rise.‚ÄúWe are hiring deliberately. And so we we‚Äôve slowed the pace of hiring,‚Äù Cook said.Although Apple‚Äôs iPhone business increased sales by over 9% on an annual basis, it came up short versus analyst expectations. Apple‚Äôs September quarter had 8 days of iPhone 14 sales, and analysts are closely looking for details about if Apple customers are trading up for more expensive models or if the new devices are poised to sustain higher sales through Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2023.Cook indicated that Apple‚Äôs performance in phone sales was strong despite signs that other smartphone companies are struggling with a recent decrease in demand and said the company grew ‚Äúswitchers,‚Äù or people who bought an Apple phone after having an Android device. He added that the company‚Äôs high-end phones, the iPhone 14 Pro, were supply constrained.‚ÄúWe clearly countered the industry trends on the on the phone if you look at third party estimates of what the smartphone industry did,‚Äù Cook said.Apple‚Äôs services business also missed estimates.Apple‚Äôs services business reported just under 5% growth during the quarter, a significant slowdown for the investor-favorite and profitable business line versus last quarter, which was 12%.For the fiscal year, Apple services grew just over 14% to $78.13 billion, a slower rate of growth than 2021‚Ä≤s 16% annual increase, and much slower than 2020‚Ä≤s 27% services growth.The business includes several different lines, including Apple‚Äôs online services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, revenue from the App Store, hardware warranties, and search deals with companies like Google.Apple recently increased prices for Apple Music and Apple TV+, but the increases started during the December quarter.Cook said the price increases were ‚Äúdisconnected‚Äù from Apple‚Äôs services performance.‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre in the if you look at the price increases as an example, music, the licensing cost has increased,‚Äù Cook said.He added that Apple TV+ has more shows now, so Apple feels that the product is more valuable.Investors generally like Apple‚Äôs move into services because the products are more profitable than Apple‚Äôs hardware and often bring in recurring revenue.There were a few bright spots in Apple‚Äôs report. Mac sales were up over 25% to $11.51 billion, even as data points from parts suppliers, chipmakers, and competing PC firms were pointing during the quarter to a significant slowdown in laptop and desktop sales after two boom years during the pandemic.Apple‚Äôs Other Products category, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, also saw an annual increase and beat Wall Street expectations. Some analysts believed that Apple‚Äôs wearables were most likely to be hurt if recessionary fears slowed discretionary spending. That business increased nearly 10% year-over-year to $9.65 billion.Apple‚Äôs iPad, which had been hampered by supply issues, decreased nearly 10% year-over-year and is Apple‚Äôs smallest individual line of business. The company recently released new models in October, which could boost sales just after the September quarter finished. Cook said that it was a difficult comparison because last year, Apple released new iPads in September.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 04:19:48'] Could that partially be that Apple is just really good at sandbagging?Look at last quarter.  Apple had 2% top line growth.  Compare that to Google with 13% top line growth.   Missed where Google does not even provide guidance.  But over 6X the growth rate that Apple delivered.Think the lesson here is give guidance but sandbag like crazy.BTW, full disclosure that I am a long term Apple share holder.  Owned before it was even considered cool.  Well I am old.  I should say the before the second time it was cool to own.   I also think that Apple is got really, really expensive and be careful.   Better investment at these prices would be Google.   It is a lot cheaper and growing a lot faster.

That would be like buying a brand new Tesla, it breaks down on the street and Tesla is like "just give us another 80k and will look at it".I have lots of examples of their customer service being absolute dog shit but that's the latest.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 04:07:23'] Search is not that one dimensional.     There are cases you really want Google search as you are doing something that is more transactional.So for example I need to find a flight from the US to BKK (Bangkok).  I go to Google and type it in and it gives me some fares.  Or I need to book a hotel.But then there are times I really want to dig into something and a large language model makes a lot more sense.So for example I was watching a movie and really wanted to know where I specific scene was filmed.    Doing this with a regular search engine is just not optimal.I started with just regular Google and then decided to bring up Bard instead.  That worked so much better and I was able to find the location.I did then use the answer in a Google search to verify it was not made up.   But with the answer it is very easy to do that.The ideal search engine is a combination of regular Google search with Bard also available at the same time.Google has over 96% mobile search market share and that is not going to go away quickly.   So Google has plenty of time to integrate the two.https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwideOne huge advantage for Google is the TPUs.  Large language models take a ton more resources than traditional search.  This article is dated but so much more true today.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/This was the original TPUs.  Google has the fourth generation in production and working on the fifth generation.  They came out with this paper recently and it is pretty good.   Basically Google found a way to save a lot of electricity by not converting back and forth from optical.  Instead switch as optical using mirrors.https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 19:25:44'] from 2021 to 2022 we saw revenue growth over 30% which is what catapulted us to these high prices. We're currently sitting over 26 PE when historically we sit around 15-20.   Looking at the numbers:  Rightnow we have 3 quarters of data. We know we will see some sort of revenue growth for q4 because TIm cook told us we would see accelerated revenue growth. What that number is we don't know. I made estimates of 10-25% revenue growth for the quarter.  Even on the high side, we will still likely see revenue growth for the full year of 2022 to be under 12%.   If you enjoy this type of information, follow along :)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 13:53:18'] Layoffs by a Microsoft tells you that the economy is a lot weaker that CNBC wants you to think. A mega cap company of the magnitude of MS does not do layoffs for the hell of it. Laying people off puts a bad taste in your employees mouth, so it's the last thing you would do to cut cost. Microsoft has plenty of cash to weather a short term storm, this tells me that they think this could last a while. This is not Coinbase laying people off... We'll see if this starts affecting non-tech giants.

POST_TEXT: b"ABNB just beat on all expectations and is down 14% off weak guidance.\n\nFinancial guidance isn't required to be given during earnings (e.g. Apple doesn't give guidance) yet it seems like companies are being valued based on their guidance. Guidance is a subjective view of the future and also a place for investors to anchor expectations (i.e. a company could give weak guidance as a tool to keep expectations low each quarter and then beat that guidance each time). \n\nMy question is then why do companies give guidance? What are the benefits of it? What are the downsides of it?"

The lowered price target reflects decreased revenue forecasts by \\~2% in both FY23 and FY24.\n\nIn our Base case forecast for Apple, we model a revenue CAGR of 10% from CY19A - CY23E which we note is an acceleration from the 3% growth the company delivered between CY15A - CY19A. We model the companys EBIT margin and EPS to expand to 28.1% and $5.81 respectively in CY23 from 24.7% and $3.17 in CY19 Our Bear case revenue and EPS estimates imply the potential for 22% and 33% downside risk vs. consensus, respectively, Hall wrote.\n\nRead the full article: [https://ph.investing.com/news/stock-mark'

POST_TEXT: b"Meta Platforms Inc ($ META), formerly known as Facebook, had an impressive Q1 2023 earnings report, beating analysts' expectations and showing strong growth in several key areas. As a result, the company's shares gapped up on Thursday's open to the tune of 15%. It was both a remarkable result and a remarkable response, which bodes well for the tech company as a whole.\n\nHow both Google and Apple had done just enough to keep the tech industry buoyant with their earnings beats, but this from Meta is a whole other story. The share price action suggests that the positive momentum could continue in the coming days, so get excited. It's a similar gap to what they experienced at the end of Jan, and it could be looking at the start of another fresh multi-month rally.\n\n## Smashing Expectations\n\nDigging into the numbers, the company's GAAP EPS came in at $2.20, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.97. Meanwhile, the company's revenue of $28.6 billion also beat expectations and showed growth"

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 15:11:28'] The Company? It‚Äôs got a very high demand for all of it‚Äôs products. This gives it superior pricing power which leads to better profit margins. All together that creates better earnings reports which raises the price per share of (AAPL), finally giving Apple a 2.7 Trillion dollar market cap.Edit: I did not watch the video btw, I just wrote this as what I assume is a simplified version of the video.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 04:26:34'] One of the big reasons is because they make so much money that they can do pretty massive buybacks and reduce the share count.They are now a mature company.    It looks like Google is now maturing and going to start doing the same.   Google is going to buy back 70 billion.   Google is going to start doing what Apple started a few years ago and would expect similar results.Google market cap is about $1.4 trillion and $70 billion buyback is 5%.   Will not get a full 5% in reduced shares.  But should get close to 4%.   Then this will happen year after year and compound.  But with Google you will get a faster growth rate.  Last quarter Apple had 2% growth compared to Google with 13%.

POST_TEXT: b' SINGAPORE, May 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose, the dollar eased and gold hovered near record highs on Friday, as investors worried that a rout in shares of U.S. regional lenders earlier this week could herald more trouble for the banking sector. \n\nMSCI\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.44% higher and was on course to snap its two-week losing streak as investors bet that the Federal Reserve may soon have to cut interest rates.\n\nAs investors flocked to safe haven assets, spot gold moved closer to its record high and the yen appeared set for its first weekly gain in nearly a month.\n\nShares of U.S. regional banks sank this week after the collapse of First Republic Bank, bringing back worries of a widening banking sector crisis that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.\n\n"There is increasing nervousness about the banking problems in the U.S. and I fear that the central banks are going too far," said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital '

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 11:21:47'] Not surprising. I think that Apple was a tricky bet unless you understood where the tech was going. When the iPhone came out while you can see the potential, there were a lot of unknowns. Still, once iPhone took more marketshare and wireless companies started to finance them for their customers, people should have jumped in. All you have to look at is how many teens use iPhones vs. everything else. They will keep growing.

There isn‚Äôt a safe place to park or invest money where you will just stay even right now, much less lose money. I‚Äôve seen crashes and tough sectors in 32 years of investing and business ownership but never seen as a whole a time this bad. Inflation, markets down 30-50%, interest rates sky high with crazy high inflation makes it almost impossible to make a return parking money anywhere. A lot has to turn around before we can even break even much less make average returns again.

Active traders could care less, especially since there‚Äôs less volume. It‚Äôs no different from any other period.The only ones who seem to care are Jim Cramer media types and the ‚Äúbuy and hold investor‚Äù. But if you‚Äôre in it for the long term, why do you care about 1 week? The whole point of buy and hold is to focus on the long term.Even if we do get a 1 week rally, it‚Äôs probably going to get unwound soon after.

Similar to Thanksgiving. Last Thanksgiving showed what home traders can do online as well as the first few days in January. There isn‚Äôt any such thing as a Santa rally although two days before Xmas and the days afterwards will be very interesting. I‚Äôve also noticed there isn‚Äôt a tax selling abundance unless it happened after the Fed meeting. Either way with the flip of a switch anyone can get online and see what the markets are doing and make a trade. I believe that the psychology of the markets controls todays up or down movements. That also means that the markets are not usually right these days since most people still have the ‚Äúbuy the dips‚Äù mentality.

POST_TEXT: b"hello everyone,  \n\n\nI hear more and more that INTEL is becoming less and less of a good choice for a long-term portfolio given its results in recent years and especially given the performance of its competitor AMD which has increasingly more market share, especially on desktop computer.\n\nI also wonder if INTEL, which has declining results, will or will not be able to hold its current dividend.\n\nI would like to have your opinion on this subject. Should we be worried about this stock and move away from it or not? It's too early to say?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers !"
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 04:24:48'] AMD.  But honestly I would avoid the chip company.   You are going to see the chips more and more come from the big guys.Apple already does their own.  Google is doing their own for not only the phones but they do all their own AI chips."Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsHeck Cruise is going to do their own.   As with Tesla and the DoJo.Amazon has started to do their own in their cloud.   It is a bit surprising that Microsoft is not doing more in this area.  Specially in terms of inference at scale.  They went the FPGA route which was clearly a mistake and should have gone the same route that Google went almost a decade ago.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/This is only going to spread and spread.Instead you want to go a layer lower.  TSMC and ASML for example.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 07:23:53'] Recent results were expected in my book. The horizon beyond 2024 looks excellent. I also think you can only compare Intel to tsmc.And is a fundamentally different business. They only design they do not produce. Tsmc does that for them. And while Intel is behind in tech right now. It is not a guarantee that they will be staying behind. They're betting big on HNA and DUV investing billions in production plants. Time will tell
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 04:09:38'] I wouldn't put a dollar in to AMD given its absurd valuation but there's an interresting road ahead.It looks like Intel will need to hold back on dividends going forward but they didnt say so yet(?).  That's what I believe given how much they are spending on new foundries and R&D. When it comes to competing with AMD, they will probably not catch up until H2 next year if they release their new generations in time.What to look forward to, will they release next gen chips in time? Granite rapid being the most important since it is the one that is supposed to catch up with AMD. If they succeed with that and keeps releasing according to plan their coming Diamond rapids follows, this has basically only been rumored and leaked, but it would, if it releases in time get ahead of AMD (according to rumors).In essence its a turn around case, if it works it works. Otherwise they could just adopt the businessmodel of TSMC. Let others produce their chips in their foundries.If anyone will make this happen it is their current CEO, but they can't screw up on timelines anymore, that'll bury them. There might be errors in my analysis, I'm open to discussions

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:19:04'] Even if it was, I wouldn't bet against the company that owns the strongest brand in our world today. As nice as numbers can be, they do nothing to adjust themselves to reputation value and brand value. Also, it's the top holding in both the SP500 and the Nasdaq indexes. Meaning, passive money keep flowing to it from people who aren't even directly invested in it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:15:48'] You're missing very important variables in your analysis - too many to mention in a short response. The EPS and FCF will grow much faster than the revenue will due to services segment alone (antitrust pending.)Instead, let's say AAPL was $78 per share, like you think it should be. That would put AAPL's market cap at, what, 1.2 Trillion? They spend nearly $100 billion per year on buybacks, and growing. They'd buy back the entire company if it ever got that low again. AAPL is my one holding that I actually get excited for dips, because it means Luca can buy back more. The only way AAPL will ever get that low is if 1) China geopolitical issues/war 2) Antitrust wipes their service revenue off the face of the earth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 18:36:12'] Their fcf has historically grown at 26% with the last two years in line with this. That said I also get about 80.00 using fcf. Doing a 20% irr but using earnings multiples I get 150 so thats right where it should be according to earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 00:23:19'] DCF is not the right approach I would say, because the fair value will depends on several parameters that in normal condition would be hard to estimate, and now nearly impossible. Instead, give a try to reverse DCF. If you find the growth is too much compared to what the marker think it will be, now you **may** be right.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 02:40:41'] You can‚Äôt underestimate the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of brands. Phones are the most important products to most people and Apple controls the most well-known phone brand, therefore they have a huge advantage in the markets. You can‚Äôt quantify everything, just like crypto cannot be quantified until it becomes more ‚Äúuseful‚Äù in real world issues.Edit: I hear a lot of people saying Tesla will become the biggest company in the world, bullshit. No matter how smart your car gets, you use it to go from A to B while you use your phone for every single thing. The only companies that can overtake Apple in market cap in the near future are Google and Microsoft.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:57:14'] Why not just invest in an index like SPY that is tech heavy? I respectfully doubt you will outperform the SPY in the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:45:36'] Step 1) Buy stock in non-tech sectors
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 20:19:11'] If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.The 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.The Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.One portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).Well diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.Here is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\_analysis:sector\_rotation\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)Notice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.That portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.Best of luck.going forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:41:12'] Just my opinion and not financial advice. Apple, Alphabet, NVDA, AMD, and Tesla are 57-58%Palantir, Coinbase, and Roblox is your high risk stuff 8%I would Use your 10% cash to add to SCHD which are high dividend stocks that hedge against bear markets like 2022. Some of the stocks in SCHD include Costco, Pepsi, Merck, Amgen, Cisco, Blackrock. Then you got 4% in WMT already.So then your portfolio becomes 57% tech, 20% s&p500, 15% SCHD and WMT, 8% high risk stuff Yes out of cash but then either sell the high risk stuff that hasn‚Äôt worked or id chop some apple or Google

As a non vegetarian when I‚Äôve tried it- it tastes like meat in only that it tastes very greasy and overly smokey. It doesn‚Äôt taste at all like a healthy substitute. Actual soy/mushroom/etc based veggie burgers taste way better then whatever chemical concoction BM is.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîFor a more businessy critique- they don‚Äôt understand their target market. There are better and cheaper established products in this area, and the product doesn‚Äôt succeed very well in winning over converts.

We know what would happen.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/04/23/syrian-hackers-claim-ap-hack-that-tipped-stock-market-by-136-billion-is-it-terrorism/This happened before. Hacks of this level are state level cyberwarfare. This was a warning shot which is why the scam was obvious.But in '13 we saw a hack lead to market drop that set off trading algorithms to auto sell and buy in seconds. People lost pensions and retirements.Imagine if you're an up and coming country with this kinda cyberwarfare cough*china*cough. With grand dreams of being the worlds next economic superpower cough* China * cough.But your long-term belt and road initiative is being hindered by this crisis and your increasing devt obligations cough*china*coughIf you had the resources to algorithmically buy billions of stocks and assets for fractions of their worth, for the nano second they're that low. You could just steal wealth from other countries to bypass this issue.I wonder if a major stock exchange like just off the top of my head, the Hong Kong Exchange,  could be used by a larger country who just ignores their sovereignty and claim their country as their own and seize the exchange. Cough*China*CoughWe know where this goes.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 13:13:01'] MSFT and Apple are both solid companies. MSFT is boring while Apple isn't which is why it largely stays unnoticed compared to Apple. But MSFT's ability to generate a high profit margin and be the most profitable company in the world is insane. Apple is more reliant on products while MSFT has created a bulletproof services business that will continue raking in money annually at a high rate. Major props to MSFT. Satya is an absolute animal.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 04:19:22'] Ok. And I assume on top of your best case scenario, you ran an analysis of what happens to TSLA in a recession where demand for cars drops 20-25% overall, all while they spend record capex on expansion? I mean considering the company has to maintain 50% growth to maintain this valuation, it would be reckless not to think about what happens if externalities force a slow down. Right OP?

Competitors are getting better and better and their EVs are getting better every year. Too much competition for its current price. We have two EVs none are Tesla. Our next EV will be a Polestar maybe.

I‚Äôm not a child so Disneys classic inventory doesn‚Äôt matter to me. And less and less people are having kids. Also, there‚Äôs a ton of cartoons out there. So IP is negligible to me. And how many Star Wars and Marvel cash ins can they do? It‚Äôs played out now. I haven‚Äôt watched a single a single Marvell movie after the one where the alternate universe thing. Tldr; I‚Äôve shorted Disney in the past and will continue to bet on them losing. So long as they continue to try to stream. If they divest ESPN and stop this stupid Disney+ attempt, and sell their product like before to other streaming companies, then I‚Äôd value them higher. Disney+ is the embodiment of too much money in the system. The only thing Disney has done right, was conning UFC into signing with ESPN. They will continue to lose profits unless they abandon their direct to consumer division.

POST_TEXT: b" Dear Reddit Community,\n\nIn my article below, I describe my idea that help prevents or decrease government violence:\n\n* wars against neighboring countries;\n* actions against nations via a suggested peculiar change in public bond terms.\n\nBefore sharing the suggestion with the community, I have tried to spread the idea between investment bankers, bond legal advisors, the ICMA, think tanks, investment funds, and the media.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 12:21:09'] There are some interesting and valuable ideas here; I encourage you to keep thinking about and developing these ideas. However, I think there may be some fundamental flaws in your thinking that are leading to erroneous conclusions.The core of the problem is that your writing seems to assume that governments are dependent on currency holders voluntarily agreeing to buy debt. But this is not really the case for many countries - specifically, for sovereign currency issuers, which as it happens, includes most of the major advanced nations, who are the ones mostly responsible for wars. So you have the least leverage over those whose behaviors you most need to change.You might think that a government wishing to spend more than it collects in taxes, and thus must borrow, is at the whims of the its creditors. But it's not really the case. You'll forgive me for using America as an example, as it is the monetary system whose mechanics I am most familiar with, but the end result is the same for all sovereign currency issuers.When the United States Treasury issues debt, it does so at auction. Participating in this auction are the "primary dealers" - major domestic and foreign banks. I don't see the primary dealers curbing the government's wars, for two reasons. First, they are literally required by law to participate in Treasury auctions. Putting conditions on the purchase of treasuries would be flatly illegal, and it would mean those primary dealers lose their coveted position of privilege within the financial infrastructure.But frankly the problem is even deeper than that. I mean why does the US wage wars in the first place? Why does it overthrow democratically elected leaders to install authoritarian dictators? To put it simply, because it is in the interests of American multinational companies. Banks have no incentive to stop the American government from going to war. Quite the opposite. They profit from war. Obviously they make money financing the military industrial complex - but there are also tremendous opportunities to make money when foreign countries are opened up for investment. Such trade liberalization has been a key pillar of US foreign policy since WWII, and it has often happened at the barrel of a gun - just like the Brits and their "gunboat diplomacy" when it was their turn to be the world economic hegemons.Just to play the idea out though, what might happen if all the primary dealers suddenly and unanimously decided to stop buying debt? What would the government's options be? It could raise taxes to make up the difference. It could instruct the Treasury to buy government debt directly, rather than purchasing it in the open market. Or perhaps the Fed would simply let the treasury overdraft permanently.There are other possible technical solutions, like the issuing of a trillion dollar platinum coin. But the point is, at the end of the day, the money is a tool of the government. The legal authority to issue money comes from the Constitution, and is vested in Congress, who has outsourced it to the Fed. Congress can self-impose some constraints - it can write a budget to say exactly how much money can be spent on what, and it can set a limit on how much debt it can issue. But if it decides that it wants to spend or issue debt, there is really no entity that can stop it - at least under the current rules of the game. It would take a dramatic legal sea change, a foreign invasion, or some other extreme and radical event for Congress to wind up in a place where it couldn't spend or borrow exactly as much as it wishes. This is broadly true for any sovereign currency issuing government, which includes the uk, canada, australia, china, Japan, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and others.

Bob then held onto stocks after the drop, saving a total of $46,000, and not getting up the gumption to commit more savings until September 1987‚Äîright before a 34 percent crash. Bob then continued to hold tight, making only two more investments before retirement, which came right before the 2000 crash and then the 2007 crash*Even after all these misfortunes, Bob actually made money. He turned his $184K invested into $1.6M ‚Üí an annualized return of 9%. The simple secret behind Bob‚Äôs success is that he never sold his investments.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 07:04:53'] While I agree with the message, the real secret to Bob‚Äôs success was his ability to lump sum such a large amount in the beginning. Most people are going to be starting with a few hundred/thousand dollars as opposed to nearly $50k. It also helps he took on excessive risk.

POST_TEXT: b'## Whats A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings\n\nApple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, lets understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be too high. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\n\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they'

A stock is the whole thing ... If you own TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, you own 3 stocks. Each of those stocks you own a certain number of shares. Nice little writeup btw!

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 22:49:25'] The real reason to split is the Options market.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-14 03:50:06'] The stock split is an acknowledgement that big companies know that there are a lot of stupid investors and that they can take advantage of it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 11:17:36'] To keep holding WKHS or to get in on AAPL... That is the question.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 20:17:03'] I always hate the notion that stock splits do not add any valueIt completely changes options and allows for more choices to wheel or have single long calls (instead of confining a small account to only spreads).
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-17 11:43:43'] How does this have an effect on options? Does the strike price also get divided down?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-26 00:09:54'] It might turn out in favour of you as lowering a company‚Äôs share price can put its stock within the reach of smaller, individual investors. It is also good for the company‚Äôs liquidity and creates more demand for its stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 10:26:27'] I think one of the benefits also is that companies that give out shares to their employees can do so much easier when the stock is split to a lower value.  Tesla cant give out 10 shares at 1500 because that is a 15000 , but 10 shares at 300 is only 3000 and more manageable to do large scale to employees.    It would sound silly from to say thanks for sticking with us, here is your 2 shares.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 11:10:20'] The price change will be more dramatic at Tesla, whose stock was trading at more than $1,500 a share on Wednesday. Its 5-for-1 split, also set for August 31, will bring an individual share into the $300 range.

Some things like coffee and some fish are more expensive, other things not so much. I am not buying less and go once per week. Inflation is sticky, but today was a huge over-reaction in my opinion. Powell said higher for longer. It takes 6-12 months for any rate hike to have an effect so that it should start to have an effect in the 4th quarter and thereafter. He will keep rates at a high level for longer. There is no need to raise 100 BPS at the next meeting. Also, QT at the higher, final level starts 9/15. Younger people who invest and those on Wall Street are often inexperienced and over-react to things. I lived in the 70‚Äôs with gas lines, stagflation, and VERY high rates. We need to expect what Powell said, increase economic growth, and increase productivity. Immigration reform at the high level and lower levels would reduce inflation as well.

POST_TEXT: b"A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?\n\n# Operations\n\nFirst of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.\n\n* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts\n* 16% increase in number of tran"
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 19:06:00'] Ebay announced their intention of stopping Paypal as a mode of payment on their site in, I think, July 2023.I am not familiar with any announcement they've rescinded this decision. And another part of the death sentence Ebay appear to have judged themselves as worthy... Sounds like they use the same PR firm as Nike and Bud!However, to many folk, Paypal and Ebay are synonymous and there shall be a perception of severe harm to Paypal which bothers me.

POST_TEXT: b'Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.\n\nDeals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 08:35:26'] Think of it this way: Microsoft PCs default browser is Microsoft edge, whose default search engine is Bing. Most everyone goes out and gets Chrome, which has Google installed. Even if Google wasn't allowed to make Google their default search engine I can't imagine people going out if the way to choose Bing or another competitor.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 07:15:05'] So when people pay google to be the number one search result , its okay.But, when Google pays apple to be the default search choice it is... illegal?When my work computer has default Microsoft edge, I use Bing to search for Google Chrome. It's not just "people are too lazy to swap search engines".In China, Tencent and Alibaba were fined for NOT allowing other companies to be on their platforms. Anti trust fines.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 09:21:15'] Compare it to grocery store chains like Krogers (one of the nation's largest) or Walmart (one of the world's largest) accepting payment from Coke or Pepsi or various brands of some typical product like canned fruit or breakfast cereals or packaged luncheon meats to have shelf space. Do we complain? Well, we expect stores to stock products, but to get paid to do it is an added issue. Should it be criminal?I think we often look at the end result and ask if it appears monopolistic. If it does, then we look at the factors contributing to it (like the payments) as questionable if not outright illegal. Each case would be its own case.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 07:18:32'] \- people can change their default search engine and most prefer Google Search
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 05:59:03'] Does Google offer unbiased search results? Can you pay google to ensure you are favored when searched? Does google provide transparency to the process of how something pops up in searches? If that answer is no. Then having google as the default search engine does become a conflict of interest. Google pays companies to use them as a default search engine. While Google collects money from companies to appear in search results.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 09:44:50'] ‚ÄúSelf-preferencing‚Äù should be illegal for any market place based business. Making self-preferencing illegal would essentially remove a whole host of monopolistic temptations that market place businesses often lord over their suppliers. In that world, if a company like apple wanted to create a new app-level-offering (bottom up) they would be doing so through their own marketplace the same as every other provider (without any special access/treatment/conditions). This would mean that if they added new technical capabilities for their news app offering through the OS (top down) those technical capabilities would also be available for other suppliers to take advantage of as well. Aka: If self-preferencing was illegal [this stuff wouldn‚Äôt hppen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/05/how-apple-uses-its-app-store-copy-best-ideas/), creativity would flourish on the fringes, and the users would get the most value.

Yes. Why? Primarily because they were first to market, coupled with very good, fiscally responsible business decisions over a very long period of time. More often than not, they have been successful in any direction they head in, and the financials speak to that.I don't understand the hate towards Google at all. They're a very successful company and will continue to be successful because they provide a very very VERY good product to their users, and everyone wants to use Google because they're the best search engine with the best algorithms. Sure, people can say privacy, but every tech company is dealing with privacy issues at the moment, and privacy doesn't really exist online anyway, so it's kind of a moot point for some arguments.People LOVE TikTok for their algorithm, and people love Google for it too, but Google's has almost become a point of tension for people because they are a dominant company in their industry. I just don't understand how this is upsetting for people because it's purely a symptom of capitalism in the US - not the problem itself.People want to blame Google for a lot, but at the end of the day, they're a very successful business with very smart people behind the scenes and this company will continue to grow in all financial metrics, regardless of what people sling at the company's reputation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 15:50:58'] Not at all, the problem is other companies make shitty search.

In the beginning there was Yahoo & MSN still leading search ad market share. CPC‚Äôs we‚Äôre reasonable on all. Thanks to competition. Then. One by one they folded. By 2010 there was no alternative to Google‚Äôs reach, especially outside of the US. No matter. See. Because in 2010 Google decided to mass ban ‚Äúlow quality ‚Äú advertisers. And yes, that meant even if you spent millions like I did. They wanted Fortune 500 brand dollars. And they got it. So we all moved to FB to advertise. 10 years later. The same thing. Banned. In 10 years, TikTok will do the same. It‚Äôs a cycle that monopolies exploit before they reach that stage. So, yes. Google is most definitely a search advertising monopoly like FB is a paid social advertising monopoly. TikTok might help make FB‚Äôs case they aren‚Äôt a monopoly in paid social, but that‚Äôs just smoke and mirrors. Those platforms are VERY different. You could actually pit YouTube against TikTok for a better comparison. Speaking of which, YouTube starts to bolster the case for Google being a monopoly of advertising networks. Did you know the 2 largest traffic sources in the world are owned by Google? That‚Äôs a problem.

POST_TEXT: b" Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is anticipated to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the current artificial intelligence boom in the tech industry, which has resulted in a significant increase in investments. The company's focused efforts on AI technology has positioned it as a prominent supplier for tech firms seeking AI solutions, making it a top contender in the chipmaking industry.    \n\n\nBank of America Corp. said Nvidia is at the forefront of the companies that stand to benefit from growth in so-called generative AI. Wells Fargo & Co. said upcoming chips from Nvidia are well positioned to take advantage of greater computing needs required by AI models like ChatGPT. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixqbvm6wp0ka1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d22f5693dbd9dbe95adf2330ed59ef3a7ccd733c"

Google and MSFT on the other hand could implement AI in many ways from customer support to streamlining legal/medical matters. Those are going to be the winners imo from AI

As of the close, the Dow Jones was up by 1.17%, the Nasdaq was up by 2.48%, and the S&P was up by 1.76%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was up by 3.615%, closing at 3.583%, with a spread of -58 basis points compared to the two-year Treasury yield. The VIX dropped 12.05%, Brent crude oil was up by 1.1%, and spot gold continued to rise from November 2022 to the present, with a slight increase of 0.03% yesterday, reaching $1919.3 per ounce.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 08:32:34'] MARA has moved up from a support low this week.. and is starting to break out. Should have some resistance until $9.50-$10 .. then opens up and next natural resistance levels are generally $14, $18, $28. The set up and technicals are very similar to the BBBY squeeze last August (except MARA is a buy rated stock with positive news out & catalyst going forward, and projected to turn profitable this year).. so mo rug pull at $28, like BBBY Aug squeeze. Last time MARA bounced off of support bottom- it quickly ran to $20 (at a time when BTC was lower than currently- was producing considerably leas bitcoin, and not projected to be profitable anytime soon.. and had a lower amount of short interest. So $20 is probably a minimum squeeze target.There is a lot of upside as MARA is just in the initial stage of what will likely be, a week or two squeeze.Yesterday fintel showed "0" shares available.

Fine for a young person, but as we have seen in past weeks these FANGAM stocks can drawdown pretty hard in a crisis.Edit: I would say the portfolio is under-diversified, unless you are going for a concentrated portfolio of high conviction equities.I would suggest to at least add a portion of SPY or some other broader index that is not just one handful of companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 17:26:02'] Nice, a few of them even pay dividends. I'd dump the doge and buy more stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 16:46:20'] I mentioned that I do DCA, it‚Äôs because I get paid weekly. And I don‚Äôt pay fees.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 19:44:56'] You could consider diversification by adding a company or two from energy (some solar) and finance (maybe credit card/bank), healthcare, and real estate.

Also, nothing wrong with your doge position as long as you keep it a very small % if your portfolio. I would DCA into BTC/ETH more than doge if you have an interest in crypto exposure
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 13:36:29'] Since your portfolio is mostly made up of the biggest companies in the SP500 that contribute at least 20% to the SP500, why not just go for the index instead?  You then have a far better risk/reward ratio since you are betting on basically the same companies + less risk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 16:44:36'] IMO, you don't have enough capital to diversify yourself.   Not sure if you're paying brokerage fees on every transaction or not, but if you are, you're getting eaten by those.  You're likely better off in an S&P 500 and putting the larger sum towards it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 17:13:44'] Personally I wouldnt prefer Doge, TSLA, PG and Target but the rest is fine and maybe focus on 1-2 stocks that arent tech stocks and like others say invest a larger % portion into etf index that covers most top stocks or spy500

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:21:00'] You think we can have bull run with no QE and highest rates in 15 years? With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? None of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don‚Äôt make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it‚Äôs too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:45:05'] In response to the first picture, it‚Äôs going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn‚Äôt expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it‚Äôd have been near the end of the year or early next).The best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there‚Äôs essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.If October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it‚Äôs just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we‚Äôre at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.But if 3490ish doesn‚Äôt stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 15:09:36'] Great analysis man. Keep it up...!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 17:54:02'] Thanks for the comment. Market is still very bearish, but it‚Äôs just liquid enough to ward off a year end crash. However this can change in a moment‚Äôs notice ‚Äî new CFTC positional data can cause me to abandon my thesis so I‚Äôll update if that flags!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 13:56:37'] Won‚Äôt matter to me, I‚Äôm DCAing for the next 30-40yrs before I bother caring about the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:17:46'] Thank you very much for this very complete analysis!It makes a lot of sense for me. Even though the indexes chart were telling me to look for a larger rally, I couldn't find more reason to back my thesis than "trust the chart, the fundamentals will just happen at the right time". This is much appreciated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:05:40'] I actually just went long this last week on the Q's/beat up tech because I believe something similar. I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. As a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 14:13:18'] How would an imminent collapse in treasuries or housing affect this thesis?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:14'] What Jerome powell actually said:  "I don‚Äôt see the case for real softening just yet" (talking about the labor market)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 19:58:46'] Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. From Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. Powell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. Notice how they are slowly raising the expectation? How does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) Powell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. "Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own."  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. Powell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into "value companies." There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called "dealers" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. Oh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. Ps Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate.
