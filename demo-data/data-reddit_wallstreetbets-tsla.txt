	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 11:35:34'] This has got to be fake because the freak is actively commenting on fucking keanu reeves posts during the trading day. If you were really holding this position youd be rolling around on the floor trying to decide what to do, or he'd have already posted the gains. Not fucking shitposting on other subs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 15:51:16'] My regard friend tried buying a put when some stock was down and he accidentally bought calls. Whatever it was mooned the next day into a multi bagger. I hope this goes the same way for you bro.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 15:41:39'] I was just looking at calls for Tesla. News about GM picking up the charging Network should keep it going after open. I'd watch after the first hour and potentially sell. It may correct a little before FOMC week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 12:27:12'] why wouldn't you sell at market open?   that's usually always when them calls are highest, theta eats that money away every minute on day of expiration, especially if the stock moves sideways or down in this case, man, missed out on 400k, literally lost a nice house, what a waste
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 07:36:26'] This is fake. Look at this guy's post history.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 13:16:11'] Need an update‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 14:34:00'] I gotta say two things:1) I admire your outlook and thank you for sharing this with this sub.  I felt awful for you because of reason number two..2) During the meme stock fervor I bought calls whose value overnight was about + 425k and I remember the feeling I had at night.  It wasn't happiness so much as an adrenaline fueled spike of possibilities, what I would do with that cash and how would I leverage it into more buying and what if it went up even more and I had millions!  The idea that it would dissappear by morning had me checking my app nonstop to look at AH action and watched futures all night and I remember thinking "this is too much" I didn't like the feeling, I mean obviously a ton of money is always nice but trading is too much for me.  I do 5k-10k options per week now to deal with it as I love the action but man oh man your post brought me right back to January 2021.  &#x200B;anyways man I wish you the best and hope you can repeat the success you almost made and even more !

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 09:44:33'] If you're still holding and didn't sell I am honestly hoping the stock ends up going another $20 because that will be a devastating loss that you didn't realize such a gain

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 16:27:40'] I‚Äôve seen people say on here something about if a stock closes above a (an unexpected high, like $250) strike price that shares have to be bought and that could continue a rally on Monday.if that is the case, Is this one of those situations where if TSLA closes above $250 it‚Äôs going to be like $275 on Monday? And ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù evil forces will be trying to make it drop to $249 at close Friday?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:32:13'] TSLA will close between $225 and $230 tomorrow. Look at the 5 Day Chart. Everybody will cash out after a good week as traders are becoming more anxious that the FED isn't done with tightening. Now 25% of wallstret participants expect another rate hike next wednesday vs. 21% in the last survey from monday morning. Don't be a fool and cash out sometimes in the moring.And about the supercharger thing: for me it's a sign of weakness, they have to look for other ways of income as car deliveries slow down. For Tesla owners it sure would be better if they wouldn't open the supercargers as more users ultimately result in longer waits

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 14:50:30'] You just had $8,000 laying around to put it into out of the money call options that expires in 2 days??? crazy play.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 20:03:37'] For those don‚Äôt understand how this guy made money or don‚Äôt fully understand ‚Äúopening/buying long/bullish calls‚Äù.. read on.He decided to purchase TSLA $240 Long Call options when it the stock was approx $225 (aka the underlying) on Wednesday, with 2 days till expiration, for $1.26.  He knew that if it didn‚Äôt go above $240 by 48 hours he would lose it all.  Fortunately, during the time of the screenshot, TSLA was trading around $249, his prediction that TSLA would exceed $240 was correct with a value of $9 per option contract, he paid $1.26 per.  He didn‚Äôt exercise the option because he doesn‚Äôt have the funds to do so.Instead, he just sold the options to someone else who probably exercised it, not that it matters to him.So basically, the stock (underlying) went up 10% in 48 hours & the odds of predicting that correctly is highly unlikely, therefore the large payday.  Again, he has 48 hours since he chose that timeframe to sell (close) them at whatever value he wishes but since time is the enemy, if the stock does not move in the direction he thinks then his call option will rapidly lose value as the market will see it more & more unlikely to reach the 240 mark.  Vice versa, because the stock began to rise, his option begun to increase in value as it became more & more likely to reach & exceed that mark.

Most people look at Tesla like it was a fad ran by a compulsive liar, I mean confidence man, or  businessman that has consistently spewed pipe dreams to get his fanboy‚Äôs hard and dump their loads , I mean money into him. I mean his companies. Tesla missed out on the Electric Truck market and is probably dead in the water. All these gimmicks mixed in with the growth picture and the fact that Tesla was the only EV company over the last decade are going bye bye. Congrats regard.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:36:30'] This rally has not run out of steam yet.   My bet, it'll reach 265.  Then, I will be shorting the everlasting cucumber out of it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 12:40:37'] I hate TA on bullish/bearish stock, the market is irrational, you can't put rationality in something that doesn't have rationality.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 18:30:04'] You are regarded.First, measured moves.Two, they have secured GM and Ford Ev's charging.That's why tsla pumped ovn, and chpt plummeted 13%.I wouldn't necessarily buy tsla right now, but I most certainly would not bank on a strong pull back.This in a BTFD scenario
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:45:00'] O what is this worth charting
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:33:09'] Dude u fellow regard let me tell you something, TESLA has been overbought since FUCKING 2019 THIS IS FUCKING OLD NEWS. u r just tooo regarded to understand TESLA WILL ALWAYS GO UP!!!!!!!! TSLA 1000 6/30 CALL LETS GO!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:46:56'] Yes, Same thing was said in 2019 before it more than doubled again and again...Please go short, then my next purchase can be a bit cheaper.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 17:36:04'] Don‚Äôt ever bet against a narcissist, they will do whatever it takes to win hence Elon! .
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 18:05:06'] Sometimes when conventional wisdom suggests something ( in this case a pull back ) it‚Äôs wise to take the contrarian position and bet with the trend.  Clearly it‚Äôs overbought, a pull back is due and the recent uptrend of consecutive up days is unprecedented, however, stocks like Tesla defy reason and play mostly with the FOMO crowd at this level and it seems like Musk is doing everything he can to regain the trillion dollar valuation again.  I would not bet against the richest man in the world and the support of the US government with subsidies and incentives.   My opinion is we trend up and down until we see 300 and correct back to a trading range of 245/300 until Q 3 when we regain the 350+ range and trillion dollar valuation.Don‚Äôt trade on this post - only my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 23:44:30'] I feel 285-300 is the appropriate range before a pull back. I see about 270 for next week.If I am not mistaken we are due for another interest rate hike - if there is a pause, TSLA will definately hit 290 before a minor pause back down to 250-260.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:06:54'] This stock amazes me to the day. No matter what people think it does whatever it wants. It defies logic. It should go down as it's overbought and a fomo stock. But will it? Probably not.  It should have started to go south but one news or a fart ...it goes up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 15:10:15'] OP says overbought but says will buy again. Dumbass
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 15:24:05'] OP clearly don‚Äôt understand that 90% of us aren‚Äôt in it for 19%. Good for you OP, but we trying to be like Elon for a reason, we shooting for 1000% returns

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 04:49:10'] The top grey line doesn't quite match the stock price peak in the second peak, seemingly too make it look like a more downward trend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 06:42:06'] You'd think so. But that's what everyone said in 2021 when it broke 800, then a month later it hit like 1200.Don't fool yourself by thinking a stock like tesla needs to behave rationally.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 09:19:03'] When I see these kinds of posts I can't help but think there's more room for Tesla to run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 09:20:43'] Tesla has one good week and now its back to being overbought. You can't predict what the stock is going to do based on charts, its driven by good or bad press. Last year, Elon was getting smeared, so the stock took a nose dive. Now the stock is finally getting some good press.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 09:36:57'] Got it.  Buy calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 09:53:04'] Calls it is
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 10:48:22'] Yeah, but it‚Äôs Tesla. This fucker could run straight up for weeks without breaking a sweat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 10:58:05'] The only thing I've ever regret with $TSLA is trying to time it. I bought 15 shares right before the infamous 'private at $420' tweet. Tried selling after large jumps to 'lock-in' the gains, and only lost money putting those gains in other places. Since holding it, I have had no regrets and instead of seeing the drops as times I "should have seen it coming" as times to buy more. It has worked out great, helped me pay off my student loan and save for a downpayment on my first home at 23.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 10:33:24'] Selling low, buyback on a higher price, not the best trading strategy IMHO
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 12:10:17'] Thanks for posting I think you are right, if I had over 100 shares I'd sell calls get some premium I've got 40 shares I'll probably sell half
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 10:06:43'] As you can see from the chart, Tesla (TSLA) is up 17.01% today and is currently trading at $1,179.02 per share. The company has been on a tear lately, gaining 50% in the last month alone. I believe that this trend will continue as more and more people become aware of Tesla's innovation and potential.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:10:08'] TSLA has skyrocketed since my last comment on here explaining the reasons I am bullish on TSLA to the point where TSLA reached the $250 level and got rejected. TSLA is now extremely overbought on numerous timeframes and indicators and created a gap on Friday that will most likely be filled this upcoming week. TL;DR‚Äî TSLA is overbought and at a top now. Take your profits now or lose them, regards üìâ

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 18:00:22'] I think it‚Äôs ridiculous to think Tesla is overbought and not NVDA, Amazon, etc‚Ä¶ Everything that has to do with AI is overbought. Tesla has a lot more room for growth this year. The AI investor does not have a lot of places to go, NVDA is already thru the f***ing roof, and the markets are anxious for some more of the AI piece of the pie. Many AI stocks are purely meme stocks. Tesla is extremely underpriced if they happen to put out a fully autonomous vehicle by the end of the year / first quarter of 2024. They are not a simple EV car manufacturer, They have robotics, AI, software, they have more user data than any other car company..: Elon owns other tech companies that could massively benefit Tesla products and services in the future. I would never buy stocks of a car company in 2023 but Tesla is not just a car company. Just my opinion, but I think tesla at least is worth what NVDA is worth right now at around 432, my bet is Tesla is going to reach 300 very fast like in 2 weeks, and it will be worth at least 350 by the end of this year. That is my personal opinion and the reason I‚Äôm loading up on tesla, don‚Äôt trade based on this.

I just don't get what niche it's trying to fill. Anyone here who is interested in this and why?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:07:53'] I'm not sure what you're trying to say with this mathguy100. Are you trying to boast about your Tesla stock call options, or are you just asking for my opinion on the matter? If it's the former, then I have to say that I'm impressed - those calls are currently up 99% from when you purchased them! However, if it's the latter, then all I can really tell you is that Tesla stock looks like it could be a good buy at its current price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 12:37:04'] I fiddled around with leverage in 2020 and 2021 on TSLA, managed to turn something like $15k into $40k at the top.Then 2022 hit, and every time I hit -50% and the platform autoclosed, I was convinced "that was it, it's not gonna fall any further". I ended up on $2k before I called it and said "fuck it, I'll go 'no leverage'".Which happened around December 2022. Those of you following TSLA knows what's happened since then... Up 141% UTD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:15:23'] I'm currently short 245 shares, so bias af, but here's a quick short-term bear case:1. Price cuts coming in hard. Last quarter earnings didn't include the lion's share of the discounts, so earnings will suffer.2. China factory output will be reduced due re-tooling for the Project Highland refresh.3. Anti-Underpants gnomes and reverse profit?

Dude said he already had 95% of his networth in TSLA @ like 1400 pre split. He was flexing about being in Bali in his boat, and I was just some dumb poor who couldnt possibly be right about its runaway valuation. Ive been waiting for the 1 year remindme to come due any time now. Dragging my nut across his face is going to be more satisfying than my puts. I plan on asking him if he wants to sell his boat. Im in the market for one this summer. Im a petty degenerate like that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 19:46:22'] Idk why you would put money into tesla. It's a meme stock that has its value strongly tied to elon musk, a person who is ever increasingly more disliked.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 19:53:59'] Also Tesla needs to be replaced with a company that does not use batteries. Several options exist. 1) ethanol or biodiesel powered generator that sends electricity to super capacitors for powering in wheel electric hub motors or 2) pedal powering via fly wheel and alternator super capacitors that power in wheel hub motors. Maybe a small solar panel on the roof to charge a single AAA rechargeable battery that provides the initial start up current for the alternator so you don‚Äôt have to replace a battery once a year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-09 17:14:15'] Whenever Tesla dips, I open a long put ratio spread. So if it‚Äôs at $190, I sell a put at 200, then buy 2 puts at $180, all for like 30 DTE. I know it‚Äôs not going to stay at $190, so if it goes below $180 I make money and above $200 I still have the premium collected. I can usually close the trade in a few days either way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 18:50:51'] So let me get this straight.   you waited until the very end of a 110% bull run on TSLA to then decide to gamble on monthly OTM calls with insanely high IV?   This ain't the bears fault homie, TSLA was overdue for a consolidation period and you just simply don't understand how the market works.   The hedge funds thank you for your contribution.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 22:11:24'] This trade -which turned into an investment- had no shot from the start. The IV was already ramped up in Feb since the stock had doubled in a short period. You could‚Äôve quadrupled that same $60k just trading TSLA from both sides in the past 2 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 23:04:31'] No offense buddy , trading reveals one s character , you are too erratic , sell it and then go with 5 companies and sell calls or puts , no fancy things and wait You‚Äôll be back in green Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 10:36:37'] The s&p has been swinging from 3800 to 4200 in a trading range for the past year. When it is at one end, it starts going back to the other range.TSLA went from $100 to $220 in 3 months. Most stocks don't go up more than 10-20% in a year at most. If you are gonna take a gamble, you should go with the better odds, downside. Stock don't go up indefinitely and follow the market.

You could also sell some covered leaps for big bucks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 19:50:48'] >If you're comfortable holding onto your position for the long term, then there's no reason to sell just yet. The market can be volatile in the short-term, but over the span of 10-20 years, it's likely that your investment will increase in value. Of course, there's no guarantee and you should always consult with a financial advisor before making any major decisions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 22:37:10'] Tesla is not a good technical trading stock.It's a fundamentals and sentiment stock.  It is a company leading the global automotive industry around by it's earlobe.It also randomly moons when Elon does something smart and crashes when Elon does something stupid.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 09:17:32'] I live by a Tesla delivery center in the greater seattle drove by last week and they had hundreds of Tesla on the lot. It was over flowing into other parking lots nearby. Drove by yesterday and there was 2 on the lot. And the over flows were all empty. Fucking crazy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 12:46:16'] Understand the rational mechanics behind sentiment, because individual emotions are irrational but group behavior is predictable.-	Consistent output delivers slow growth. Consistency is safe (good), but also boring (bad).-	Overabundance initially generates better prices, which improves sentiment but inflates value to unrealistic levels. This creates both a bull and bear case unless followed by industrial output.-	Scarcity always follows a rush to abundance. Sentiment sours when need can't be met, but in two different ways. If scarcity is partial, it increases percieved value. If scarcity is total, the company cannot deliver and sentiment tanks instead.-	Groundbreaking news delivers immediate sentiment spikes (Microsoft/OpenAi)-	Lackluster responses to groundbreaking news delivers immediate dips (Google)-	Fundamentally both of the prior return to the status quo, because there is a distinct worth disparity between an innovation and actual application of it to a real purpose. The former is speculative worth, the latter is real worth.-	Very bad news causes an immediate dip in sentiment, like an oil spill (Enron/Exxon/BP/etc)-	Despite doing awful stuff, a company already anchored into infrastructure should always be expected to recover after a spanking. We are all still reliant on their services, and that need does not go away. These are excellent speculative positions, for instance BP still had exclusive contracts with the pentagon for decades, which is a guaranteed return. Whether we are mad at them or not does not really change that.-	A fluff company cannot recover from a spanking. Their product didn't matter, and the hype is gone, which was their only momentum.-	If you can't find a good investment idea, bet on whoever is quietly working on the main thing the world needs right now.-	If you can't find a good speculative position, bet on the poker chip factory, not the casino. Gambling returns are shaky, but gambling as a whole has a consistent demand. Poker chips satisfy the casino's needs, gambling satisfies a want. Needs hold more worth than wants.-	Trust seasonal sentiment because we are creatures of habit. Retail is a good bet leading up to holiday shopping. Oil is a good bet in the winter. Travel is good in the summer. Bet on what people do when they do it.-	Do not neglect your own individual bias, and check your own shit. You are human and also have irrational sentiment, and it is very easy not to remember that money not lost is as good as profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 14:13:08'] lol well alllllll seven of them drove past me on a semi truck last night. Bullshit article.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:23:23'] Isn't Tesla's big advantage their margins on each car sold? Doesn't cutting prices by 20% pretty much destroy that? Also if demand is so high that they can't meet it, why would they slash prices this hard?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:36:10'] Tons of inventory in Euope still, despite the price cuts. Might be some pent-up demand in the US as people were waiting for the new tax incentives. Have to admit I lost quite a bit of money with my shorts so will stay away from them for now, but I think it's only a matter of time before other manufaturers can ramp up their production as well and then it's tough times for Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:04:02'] I find it amusing that you think Tesla is doing well just because they cut prices. The fact of the matter is that they are struggling to meet demand and their cars are overpriced compared to other options on the market. If anything, this just goes to show how much money Musk has been bleeding from Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:15:02'] puts on tsla... they cant meet demand...

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:56:26'] tesla are probably going to demolish delivery targets this month considering they were building up inventory before and will probably have another quarter of record production too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:34:55'] Ahhh yes. Using trailing information to buy calls on. Never mind the tech bro layoffs are accelerating, which is the largest buying group for Teslas.Edit:Also when I go to my local inventory, there‚Äôs more than 7 Ys in the 200 radius, so I‚Äôm sure this source is total legit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:29:09'] Picked up delivery of a Y last week. The center console fucking rubs up against the passenger seat. Who designed that? Bought puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:20:49'] I like calls on this right now, I think that it has some momentum to the upside at the moment
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:48:05'] They can't sell cars they don't have. Sounds like puts? lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:13:52'] OP is a moron. Puts are the way now. Those cars sold will have issues. They were produced too fast and Teslas already have issues. I see so many videos where the finish on their cars are off, siding is peeling, just low quality finish. The stock has doubled in a month! And, self driving will never happen. People are calling Musk out. I don't see this going well for Tesla. A lack of inventory is almost as bad as too much inventory. You need a steady flow. Now, people won't be able to buy his cars for a while. That should hurt his brand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:31:07'] Holy shit it‚Äôs like they managed to sell off all their old inventory despite ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù and now they are free to restock while every other company worries about manufacturing, delivery and sales. Crazy. /s
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 01:43:56'] Totally, Because Tesla's Performance Metrics are NEVER over-exaggerated.How's that 2017 Tesla Semi coming along again?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:04:40'] How soon can they return to previous pricing? Needs only a 25% increase now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:13:32'] NOT. ONE. PENNY.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:14:57'] Didn't they cut the price because the government axed the tax break on EV purchases?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:15:35'] This data is likely generated from scrapping off the Tesla website. One of the sites that many use as a source says that data may not be accurate as Tesla can add to existing inventory and website won't show the latest data always :https://tesladata.mattjung.net/about-the-data/

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:18:25'] Because 10% inflation and rates getting higher every 6 month? If I still had my Y it would be 170 euros more expensive/month.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:21:14'] Maybe they should have only dropped the price by 10%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:21:36'] Think long term.  Puts on tsla as it becomes unable to actually sell cars

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:58:15'] For Tesla I would just swing trade it. Only earnings I would do calls. Otherwise, not gonna yolo in until Tuesday.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 08:59:25'] Tesla stock price is where it is today because of profit margin not because of how many cars they sold. Toyota sells more than twice what Tesla sells

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 09:06:03'] Price cuts will significantly impact Tesla‚Äôs profit margin for the quarter, and probably for the year

They could beat earnings and still go down because someone in mainstream media decides that 21% margins are bad. Or 18%. Or whatever. You could guess right on earnings and still lose money. This is a straight up gamble. Would say the same if you bought puts. The only real TSLA play is longer term. You're just gambling my friend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:29:40'] Massive margin compression coming as they prioritize unit volume growth. -24% earnings growth YoY. Gross margin cratered to 19.3%. This is the start of a new long term trend in Tesla profitability. Increased competition will drive price competition and margin compression. The pandemic auto bubble has also popped and dealerships and Tesla are having to slash prices and eat it on margins.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:31:29'] Turns out Tesla is neither a tech nor Ai company . It‚Äôs CAR  company
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:20:18'] Look at those margins trends, and then consider that they've continued to have very large price cuts, most of which are not fully (or at all) reflected in these numbers as of 3/31.Still a great, innovative, important company.  But this is a car company.  It's a brutally competitive market, with massive capex costs, and TSLA no longer has unique pricing power.I'd happily own TSLA stock, but not anywhere close to the current price.The investment thesis at these prices can only really be that this is still the king of all meme stocks and you're going to ride it up and sell to retail bagholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:05:45'] Tesla's first quarter results show that the company is on track to achieve its goals for the year. The company delivered a record number of vehicles in the quarter, and its production levels are also at record highs. The company's cash flow and net income were both strong, and its balance sheet remains healthy.Tesla is well positioned to continue growing in the future, as it expands its product lineup and continues to invest in new technologies such as autonomy and energy storage.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 15:30:09'] Wow, President Biden is really reaching out to Elon Musk and Tesla to help build a better EV charging network. This is a great example of the government working with the private sector to improve our infrastructure. I'm glad that Tesla is going to be a part of this project, and I hope it will make a difference in how people view electric vehicles.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 18:01:16'] Put a screen at every station comparing what car is being charged to the next equivalent Tesla as a targeted attack ad. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you love your Ford Lightning, but did you know that the Cybertruck not only enjoys higher horsepower and a longer range, but it is also 20% less expensive!‚Äù

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:10:06'] This is a major positive for Tesla even though I am bearish on the stock. The government is going to end up forking (read: subsidizing) the bill for non-Tesla owners to charge their vehicles. If you know anything about how defense companies, software companies, and more recently pharmaceutical companies fleece the United States government, you know this is going to be a huge windfall for Tesla over the long run.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 00:05:00'] Should have forced them to adhere to a standard EV charging plug, instead he gave them a monopoly over EV in this country for the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 01:08:26'] good news for those would be EV drivers who want non-Tesla EVs
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 01:08:40'] I don't get the sense Tesla makes a lot of money per KWh from superchargers, and Tesla customers will hate having to share, as many superchargers are already crowded. There will also be more things breaking if other EV owners use the network. Meanwhile, the supercharger network was one of Tesla's biggest advantages compared to other EVs. Sales suffer as a result. Could lead to charger price hikes and more bad press. Seems very bearish to me overall.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 01:17:26'] My No. Rule is never to bet against Elon. If you dont like tesla or is nervous do not get involverad in tesla stock

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 01:32:27'] It is never bullish when the government makes a company do something that it could have voluntarily done at any point. That said, it will keep pumping until March 1 so Elon can dump shares March 2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 01:59:22'] Callls
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 02:03:56'] I just did some basic research on this. According to an April 2022 article by electrek, there is a 70% Texas subsidy for charging stations in which Tesla requests $30k, which means a station cost them 43k. 43k x 500k stations in the Biden/Tesla subsidy brings the total cost to 21.5B at the current price point. So 7.5B is roughly 35%. If these subsidies stack directly that is 105% subsidized (for Texas at least). Additionally if the new deal isn‚Äôt percentage based, the economies of scale would mean Tesla would make a nice profit instantly by installing them. There are a few big IF‚Äôs, but I like the numbers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 02:07:15'] Well shit. Top comments say calls. Time to inverse WSB!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 02:12:38'] I bet you those senators bought calls/shares on Tesla before that announcement

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 02:41:06'] Question why not both ? (To lose money more effective and give it to the bank directly) (but could that work in terms of high volatility trade idk I‚Äòm new to losing money)
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 02:49:23'] If all the non Tesla EVs clog the Tesla chargers it will be bad for sales. But Elon will charge non Tesla cars a higher price unless they pay a monthly fee (it‚Äôs what he did in Europe).

For every dollar that Tesla's stock price is above $250, your option will increase in value by one cent. So if Tesla's stock price hits $251, your option would be worth 1 cent more than it was when you bought it (0.18 + 0.01 = 0.19).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 09:11:36'] It seems like you‚Äôre asking if the sentiment surrounding the stock will send the price up or not. Maybe, idk. However, Elon starting this new company is unlikely to benefit Tesla intrinsically. Large Language Models such as GPT are built using a transformer architecture whereas self driving cars are built using Convolutional Neural Networks. Whatever company Elon starts will likely be working on Transformer models, not CNNs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 10:49:19'] Elon needs fewer, not more, executive obligations right now. Tesla is finally experiencing true competition in the EV space and is losing market share and margin at an alarming pace. He needs to hire someone to run Twitter, stop getting involved in meaningless social media scandals, and hunker down to direct Tesla through what will likely be a volatile 12 months of recession and an actually competitive marketplace. He likely won't,  cause the guy's ego is very Hindenburg-esque (large and innately filled with its own destruction), so I'm going with puts.

It's failing to make the mainstream and is riddled with legal issues.Now he is trying to just make  ChatGPT clone, but his will not compete with GPT or Bard, it will fail and hurt Tesla stock in the long run.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 21:58:16'] Well its not like having an LLM being able to talk to you about your surroundings, providing real time notifications about everything from the composition of the atmosphere outside, to the best restaurant, to local street fights and crime stats, to full connectivity to and understanding of surveillance camera footage, would in any way be a worthwhile add on to a Tesla subscription.And I'd really rather not be able to monetize all that video data my car is taking while it drives around by having an AI index it, making it searchable and therefore saleable while also discarding useless noise so that data storage is more efficient. It's not like if the AI told me that if I took a 2min detour down some street to film it, I'd make $50 for the feed, would change my behaviour or anything. Nope, I see no benefits here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 23:56:33'] twitter's latest added feature of on-spot stocks purchase directly from the twitter handle is enough to boost TSLA's stock and opening a new Ai company ain't gonna harm atleast, if not benefit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 05:43:33'] Everything Musk does effects the stock of his companies.  You can be sure he is looking for some distraction from Twitter.  The interesting thing on this is that it is more in his wheelhouse and ties nicely with his bread and butter.  Potential distraction aside, I lean positive on the reaction.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 06:24:13'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 07:20:28'] Elon literally tweets about memes and they skyrocket.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 07:25:33'] The AI will self develop itself and then develop full self driving software for Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 08:38:32'] Slashing prices is the bigger short term effect on tsla price. Hedgefunds don't like that and therefore the price will maintain downward pressure. X.AI is unrelated and regardless of how retail feels, the impact from retail is insignificant in this case.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 08:41:01'] Tsla will likely breast feeding the new company, I‚Äôd Elon really want to help Tsla he would just add another department like Amazon Microsoft or google

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 11:25:12'] I think it will help TSLA reach full self driving much faster. Will also help lower the cost of manufacturing and increase efficiency across all business's Elon owns. &#x200B;Being short NVDA and TSLA is pointless, i gave up on my puts, going long. Came to realize people have money to invest, they are looking for a reason to buy stocks, not sell them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 13:15:57'] I would guess elon wants his own Ai assistant for every tesla user and this method of producing Ai may prove beneficial to his current auto driving tech.He might be looking into building the communications network for his Ai powered cars and have an automated ground traffic control much like airspace has ATC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 16:05:31'] TSLA events are always "buy the rumour, sell the news".I would absolutely expect a drop when the event happens.I'm long for sure in general.  But if I had the courage of my convictions I'd definitely short right before big events, after the pre-event hype build up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 01:52:34'] I follow Tesla closely and I think you have at least a 60% chance of that trade working out. This could be the one time that the stock Rises after an event but it only has to drop 5% for you to make good money and that can happen easy.I think it depends on if they announce the design for the 25k car. If they don't and they focus on cybertruck then the stock will fall but if they announce it I could see the stock going up because that will make the analyst happy because they will see a easily traceable future for car manufacturing profits. A dedicated Robo taxi without a compact car as the next model first will make the analysts unhappy.

At least the mortgage was paid by his mother, whom he depended on for a weeklyallowance for basic necessities (his part time job at local fast food chain covered only his gaming hobby and Onlyfans subscription). Elon Musk then appeared onscreen, to the roaring applause of an internationally and sexually diverse crowd. Musk bellowed,  ‚Äúwe have successfully colonized Mars. Mission accomplished‚Äù. The crowds roars grew to a crescendo. ‚ÄúWhat  a fucking idiot, HAH.‚Äù He grinned smugly from his worn, blue corduroy sofa.

Their past meetings, including this one, have been product improvement meetings and how much they are saving money to make their stuff cheaper while building out their factories to make more of their stuff. Tesla has to bring out new products if it's trying to bring in more money.

Didn't mention how many cars they were delivered daily, or what 2023 would end up like as far as productions. Never mind some clarity on the new models. I get it that is hard to put a car together but that's what they are paid for. all that emphasis on supply chains. So annoyed, lost 6% cuz they can't create a F PowerPoint.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 11:50:34'] GodspeedWow I just checked the calls/puts ratio it's so close actually... It's leaning more to the calls, but dang everyone's betting it can go both ways. To be fair MSFT also got rekt'd yesterday.Edit: Guess Straddle was the play
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 13:13:53'] Up 3.5% premarket to down .4%. Keep us updated on your emotional journey, OP.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 07:34:32'] Bro let‚Äôs see your position today!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 15:45:34'] Everyone wants to know what I was gonna do if I wasn't right... &#x200B;I guess we'll never know
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 02:46:07'] Some people say he s Fucked and others congrat him for the big win, It feels like most of the people here have no clue what they re talking about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 12:00:12'] Good thinking on the expiry! That way you can offload them before they go to zero next week
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 05:37:35'] TSLA bout to open above 157 this position will be worth $110k+.  Fuck you. well fucking played.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 15:41:53'] Tesla is up $5 in after hours.&#x200B;Is OP still fucked or rich now?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 20:59:06'] Assuming an IV dump to about 60-65% and TSLA opens at 153 same as after hours. You‚Äôre looking at a small profit of 5 to 15%.If TSLA pushes to $155 though tomorrow you‚Äôre gonna make some good ass money. If anyone believes he will be down 80% with a $153 TSLA open, then you simply do not know options. Good luck OP, hope you make some dough üëçüèº

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 12:09:53'] You're predicting a huge increase in the price there. If it goes up a couple percent you can still lose out to theta.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 17:02:51'] Guys this isn‚Äôt expiring for another week OP gonna get some good gains
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 17:59:47'] Buying any options right before earnings is like having sex with a cheap hooker and hoping you don‚Äôt get an STD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 20:03:53'] Too far OTM. Sorry OP. Unless tomorrow TSLA ramps up even more these won‚Äôt end profitable. IV should collapse which will hopefully net to even. Without IV collapse you would‚Äôve won and gotten about 50% at $7-8 sale. If IV collapses 1/3 to 60% roughly then you‚Äôre at break even, assuming price stays constant. If IV collapses to 30% and price stays then you‚Äôre down half. Optimally you‚Äôd want to see TSLA shoot to $160 tmrw. Give it like 1-2hr into open if you want to gamble which I assume you do. If you don‚Äôt, try to set a sell order for your cost first thing and hope you get lucky.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 04:29:05'] For all you guys talking about IV crush, you have no idea what you are talking about.Now that earnings have passed IV will probably settle around 60% (maybe a bit more to 65%), which is the IV of longer dated options without earnings premium.The value of those calls at open is pretty easy to approximate if you know about Black Scholes.ATM calls will be worth approx. 0,4*IV*sqrt(T) where T is residual maturity.Now, 0,4*60%*sqrt(6/252) = 3,70%. Applied to current preopen spot level of 154, those calls should open at around 5.70 generating a nice 24% profit for OP if he is not stupid enough to hold on to those options whose value will decay quite fast.Given OP probably had no idea either what he was doing , congrats and FU.Source : trust me bro, this is my job
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 17:07:46'] You might only he down -50% by the time it gets to 159

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 11:47:34'] I do not recommend buying TOLA calls at this time.

Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 09:57:48'] I worked with a 19 year old kid who never shut the fuck up about stocks. Like ever. He had about 50k he won after a car accident, and invested heavily in Tesla when it was on its way up to its high. He was always in trouble with management for spending all day on his phone and talking about stocks with people who were just irritated by it.I really wonder how he's doing now. I know the kid was sweet, but not super bright. And he certainly didn't come from money. His mom was a single mom and he lived with her and a roommate. Kind of shitty that he had the opportunity to have a nest egg and likely gambled it away getting sucked into this shit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 10:50:00'] To clear something up, no I didn't start the month with $500. I actually started with $1200 in mid September. My account is now at ~$100k [proof](https://ibb.co/GHBwy7b) with the majority of it coming in the past month. I withdrew $23k around the time my account got to $30k from some TSLA puts (when it dropped from $220 to $200 in one day). The majority of my gains this month are from NVDA. I bought 15 12/30 177.5 puts when it was around 178 and sold for a 10k gain when it dropped to 154. Then I bought 30 1/6 NVDA 165 puts and sold for $48k gain when it dropped to $142 yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 11:26:11'] The most important part is to remember if you cash out in some sort of profit, you MUST put money aside for taxes. Do not end this year massively green on REALIZED profits only to lose most of that money by next April. Because then you'll be in the shitty situation of having no money on hand and massive taxes to pay. Depending on your overall income for this year, that income plus your trading profits, may put you in one of the higher tax brackets. So to be the most safe, you'll need to put 50% of your winnings aside for taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:02:00'] GameStop was a one time thing citadel isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Elon is the 1% if you can‚Äôt beat him join him. Plus space travel and ev are pretty cool I guess. He really pulled thru like a champ. I don‚Äôt share his political views but if I were him I would. What he did with Twitter seems wrong now but who knows. The stock market is not the place for morals. I am glad the brick and mortar game stop made it this far. I hate buying online. It would be cool if we could see a company especially it‚Äôs ceo for their morals and as a society make a decision. I think he might be more careful about who he hurts next time but then again maybe society shouldn‚Äôt have all the power. America is great because we hold the people in power accountable. It seems more and more there is no justice only shame.

I eat the cracked one, and the one that didn't crack becomes the champion.  Then I grab another M&M and force it to compete with the champion in this deadly game of M&M gladiators.  I do this until I run out of M&M‚ÄôS, and when there is only one M&M left standing, I send a letter to the M&M‚ÄôS brand with the champion M&M in it with a note attached that reads: "Please use this champion M&M for breeding purposes."

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:45:59'] arg I think WSB screwed me, sold almost all my tesla because I was heavy heavy heavy in margin buying the dips over and over till I had almost no money left and was close to loosing it all if it droped another 20 bucks so I sold to cover my margin since intrest was bleeding me dry. Next day it started climbing and climbing and climbing, had I held 3 more days I would be double my account, this year has sucked went from 57k to 2k thanks to market crash l. hate you people posting 100k returns, I was trying to make 100k to build a home for my family, dont look like that's happening now. Ultimately my fault but still I had planned to get back in to recoup after price dropped more, WSB stopped it from dropping screwed my plan. No more house for us :( rant over congrats winners sorry to the ones who lost big, force to sell or go bankrupt hurts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 21:46:20'] When Elon Musk speaks, Tesla loses billions in value. And he's been speaking a lot lately. so this week he's explaining to a judge why he shouldn't be responsible for Tesla shares tanking every time he tweets false or misleading information about the company's direction.in a lawsuite filed against him by Tesla shareholders who want him to shut the hell up  so they can stop losing money. After he recently claimed "falsely" that he was thinking of taking Tesla shares private and he had the money to back it up, causing yet another huge selloff.

POST_TEXT: b'145/144 bear put vertical, and 138 single put locked and loaded, might be too early but could not resist the run up.\n\nThis is a rebalance of a prior losing position in 130 puts, which I rolled up and added to them.\n\nFireworks when Kanye I mean Elon stutters to explain they are working at a huge and unsustainable loss. I will not be surprised if they cancel Q&A altogether.\n\nEDIT: This ER was a fizzle not fireworks, and the puts might be fucked. Thanks for all the comments - will post an update on Friday or when I close them, whichever comes first.\n\n**UPDATE 1/26/23: Thanks for the comments, good wishes, and ill wishes, my fellow regards. As I said in the early comments, I am OK if I lose 100% of the position since it is a small portion of my experimental Webull account.

Even with help by the "consensus", they still barely got there \*and\* there were some questionable details in the reports.  First of all, WHERE did that $4B in cash go?  Magically there is a 4.3B bite out of cash labeled as "investments".  I sure as shit hope Elon didn't send money to bail out Twitter.  If that happened holy hell.  I only theorize that because I don't think there was any mention of this investment in the call.   Second, the #'s showed that margin took a pretty good hit even though sales only really started in Dec.  Imagine what is going to happen in '23?  Couple that with the comments about costs going up and ....Third, very curious how they added a lot of employees but expenses dropped.  (e.g. SG&A)  Four, they recognized \~350M of FSD revenue to help them meet #'s.  Adoption rate for FSD is very low these days and this isn't something they will be able to keep doing.    With all that said, I hope this thing runs back to 300 so we can get some real short action into '23.  Not sure they have many levers left to pull.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 12:24:35'] Terrible idea.  Shorting the leaders in EV‚Äôs and green tech after a 70% pullback?  Smart move . You are going to get wiped out and we will all be very happy.  Pikers short, winners buy.  Good luck and I hope you are insolvent soon.

The OPEC decision to drop production will increase inflationary pressures and force the federal reserve to raise interest rates higher than anticipated 2. The liquidity crisis at the banks has just begun. This will result in tightening of credit standards3. Tesla is a premium brand and as the Covid relief vapors dissipate, the pressure increases.4. There are some extraordinary luxury EVs flowing into the marketplace with Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Maserati, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley and Rolls-Royce 5. Elon Musk is alienating many potential EV buyers who dislike his political views and Twitter tirades. He is Tesla and Tesla is he (for better or worse)All that said, when it hits $80 I will buy a bunch because of the strong command he has over his zealots.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 20:45:56'] Question he has 154 contract and cost him .90 cent so in total it cost him 142 dollars and it expire on the 6 of april and he needs these contracts to go to 411 on spy to break even right and he was fine at first but now spy is at 409 so my question is 1. When you have a contract and it hits it goal which was 411 can you collect those gain early or do you by force how to wait at the end of your contract to collect your possible gain or nothing if it doesnt hit its target2.how much would math guy gain with those 154 contract if it al hit its target of 411?3. What happens if somehow spy goes over 411 and let's say goes 416 by the 6 of april would he gain more money4. What video helps explain how to order a contract in Robinhood and pull out 5. Does robinhood have contract for 300 for tesla for April 28 kinda want to risk it and see if I become somewhat rich or stay broke got 5k willing to lose and this math guy seems interesting in his calls that ik willing to lose that 5k6. Can you have multiple contact for different days on 1 stock

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 00:33:08'] I've come a full 360 on the Cyber Truck. A first, I thought it was hideous.   Then I learned how awesome a stainless steel electric off roader could be, that it's super tough basically immune to dents scratches and rust. I began to embrace the stupid hideousness of it all.  I then I began to realise if someone were to drive this thing into a lake, those 'tough windows' wouldn't break to allow for an emergency exit, I also learned Elon was deleting things like door handles because 'it could be handled with software' ... which honestly get's me worried about the other useful things that have been removed.  Also Riven exists and you can buy one.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 12:20:06'] >Stainless steel costs more than the steel used in most automobiles because it contains chromium and often other ingredients, like nickel and molybdenum, that are in high demand. Stainless steel‚Äôs tendency to spring back to its original shape means it cannot be stamped into fenders and other parts as easily as the more pliable steel used by most automakers. It also requires special welding techniques.>Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.Ôªø

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 23:14:56'] But also an important reminder that most of the recalls are handled via mere software updates. Important safety updates that addressed real problems, sure, but it's not nearly the same level of cost to the company to push out an OTA update as it would be for a physical recall. Old school car recalls just do not compare to trivially fixed software recalls.

They had 1/10th of the recalls Ford has. Unless you think that having to take your car to the dealer, leaving it there and renting a car, and then coming back to get your car, is the same thing as getting an over-the-air-update. Question is when do your puts expire?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:50:39'] It's a case of the market being irrational for longer than you can remain solvent.Companies like TSLA, NVDA etc are on insane multiples. That  doesn't mean they will fall anytime soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 21:31:49'] Tesla has alot of interest and Cramer isn't paid to go against them so why wouldn't he want to interest viewers. In this case he's actually not wrong.There's been alot of smart trading in Tesla lately. Retail buyers have piled in near 110 even a bit before the big funds that have started to buy in.BTW many couldn't do that previously because TSLA only recently got investment grade (a joke how late that was).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 23:21:10'] I mean, if big names in the market were right even a quarter of the time, they would be regulated like inside trading, right?Instead they are paid to pump without dumping their own load, right?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 09:44:17'] It's because their sales are going up, but it's because the prices went down due to reduced quality control and lesser materials. It will go up for a bit and then crash when all these cars start falling apart, having tons of issues or exploding. There will also be more stupid people death's from those that use auto-drive and use it as an excuse to not pay attention to the road.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 14:09:07'] I'm glad you asked! Stocks are basically just pieces of paper that represent ownership in a company. The price of the stock is determined by how much people are willing to pay for that piece of paper. If more people want to buy the stock, then the price goes up. It's as simple as supply and demand.There are two main types of stocks: common stocks and preferred stocks. Common stocks are what most people think of when they think ofstocks - they give you a vote at shareholders' meetings and entitle you to a portionof the profits (if any) generated by the company through dividends or share buybacks ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:02:17'] December is usually the busiest month for movie theaters, as it coincides with the holiday season and the release of many highly anticipated films, such as Avatar - there's a reason they released it at that time. In particular, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas tends to be a peak time for moviegoing, as families and friends look for ways to spend time together and escape the cold weather.  AMC, one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States, has typically seen increased foot traffic during the holiday season. The company has reported that December is typically one of its busiest months of the year, with many customers coming to see new releases, as well as classic holiday films that are often re-released in theaters.  Expecting strong earnings report tomorrow.

Enterprise value per EBITDA should expand as well, making the sector an attractive investment opportunity over the next five years. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 15:19:02'] Tesla is perhaps readjusting their prices to reflect current cost. They profit on every car sold with a ~30% margin, so they can afford to lower their prices to boost demand.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 08:18:33'] I honestly loved the people that fixated on the standard growing pains of a scaling-up company.I'm not a TSLA die-hard, it's just a normal company, it can go bankrupt like all the rest.&#x200B;But I really got into it in 2019, after it had doubled in size several years in a row, had a scalable global business model, field-tested cars, a brand new factory that was already mass producing cars, and colossal brand value and global demand.It was basically good to go, there were simply no major dealbreakers on the horizon. Apart from black swans, I simply couldn't see any reason it could *not* succeed. Just needed time to get up to full production and the margins that come with it.Yet there were so many people fixated on the normal properties of a business at this stage."Hurr durr the cars are barely profitable, carbon credits make up 2% of their revenue, they're gonna have to scale up".All of those were true, and completely normal for a healthy business still in low-rate initial production (LRIP). Those were good signs, not bad. A company that has profitable prototypes, a clean-sheet vertically integrated manufacturing hub and is making side money on carbon credits?! Ka-ching!!&#x200B;I'll never understand how so many "investors" looked at a textbook value play and managed to get it so wrong. To be clear, I don't think TSLA was 100% guaranteed, but it was as close to a guaranteed win as you can realstically get in this world, yet shorters lost the GDP of Belgium because they looked a gift horse in the mouth.

Now no one ultimately knows as the leveraged one could just borrow more money personally against his shares to fund the deal, Tesla borrowing caveats allowing.&#x200B;Many investors do not realise boards put leverage limits on executives for exactly this reason.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 07:19:35'] I'm trying to guess if Tesla will massively increase their market share, given huge price reduction. But it seems like the market share is similar to last year, even with today's much more competitive prices. Most up-to-date numbers are from this site - [https://eu-evs.com/bestSellers/ALL\_DAILY/Brands/Month/2023/2](https://eu-evs.com/bestSellers/ALL_DAILY/Brands/Month/2023/2). 4 EU countries are updating sale numbers daily. I don't see big difference than year ago at the same time.  In other words... margins should drop. If not in Q1, then in Q2 (in Q1 more sales could be made because the price reduction was causing some hype).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 07:45:08'] Hopefully the Mar 1st investors day causes some new upward momentum from TSLA especially if they discuss new improved battery technology or more vertical integration in battery materials.

I‚Äôm not sure what to think. On the one hand, a car is a large purchase, and Tesla makes the best EVs no question. On the other, some of the original cadre of Tesla buyers were purchasing on an environment basis and as a political statement alongside the cars quality.  I don‚Äôt know if this will be material. It certainly hasn‚Äôt flipped their reputation in red states where you can get definitely get made fun of for having a Tesla.I think marginal stock pricing may be getting pushed a bit on the same dynamics. Owning Tesla stock as esg surely is related to owning a Tesla as esg‚Ä¶Or maybe this is just car loans being so expensive and they are past most of the people who pay with cash‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 02:37:40'] TSLA Had enormous margins on their cars. Put prices are going down fast.1)  Because more and more competition is coming. 2) because major tax advantages from governments in many countries for EV‚Äôs are short-term (some more years and slowly declining) - fiscal bonus is getting smaller = extra price pressure. If you have 10000‚Ç¨ margin, and you lower the price 6000‚Ç¨ - the. Your margin decreases drastically.Unless you cover this with more vehicles sold, it will put pressure on the profits. If profits grow 10% per year- then in 2035 we will have a  P/E of 18 (which is high for automobile companies but Tesla deserves a premium since they hold a lot of valuable technology / software) - if the price of the stock is THE SAME as it is today. Think about that. 10% profit growth over 12 years - every year. And at a reasonable P/E that would mean that you did not make any profit on your shares over these 12 years. Difficult to be bullish‚Ä¶.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 17:51:14'] My prayer is that you don't act like blackjack players who don't know how to quit. How about keep $100k aside and go to Options war with $65k. Heck if you can do it with $1k, I am sure you will pull it off with $65k. But then you have the $100k to make you sleep better at night. Just my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 15:11:01'] I almost did this with Tilray.  I bought a ton of options exactly 364 days before expiration.  And they completely collapsed in value.  I think I was down something like 98% at one point.  But I noticed about a week before expiration that the price was going up something like 15% per day on the stock.  So I thought "there's a chance".  On the very day of expiration my option opened in the money for the first time ever.  Not only that but the stock was something like $3 over.  So I went from near complete loss to huge gains in just one day.  Then I fell asleep.I woke up to find the price had dropped back below by literally cents.  My options were now about to become worthless.  And being an idiot I didn't think to maybe exercise them (I think this would be tax advantageous) or sell.  Expired worthless at exactly the strike price.  A few days later the stock was up something like 50% more.

The stock climbed up since he bought them so he got the profit, minus the premium for buying the calls.What was his risk? Let's assume TSLA would have dropped or not moved up and his calls were therefore worthless. Afaik he would have only lost the premium for buying the calls right?

When VIX gets to 30-35, go to cash wait for the reversal play the opposites.Yes these are leveraged, but unlike buying options they won‚Äôt just expire next Friday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 23:35:50'] That robot was the most embarrassing presentation I've ever seen a company put out.   When you've got Boston dynamics building robots that can parkour and backflip already and Tesla has to literally carry theirs out with 3 devs it just looked awful.  And they really never elaborated what purpose the robot even serves other than it watering a plant in a video it seems like a god awful waste of resources and man hours.    Would much rather get an updated Cybertruck design and a firm release date that they actually stick to.   But I guess when your company trades at a 500 P/E ratio you need to do futuristic hype projects like this and not actually produce shit people want

That whole Bill Gates short position fight saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really believe in climate change reform if you‚Äôre short‚Äù was ignorant.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 03:53:14'] I doubt it‚Äôs a correlation, because half the time Tesla stocks drop are because of his crazed Twitter rants

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 10:05:15'] Let's face it, people will buy it even if it's completely dogshit. There's enough rich fuckers out there willing to drop $20k on something just to say they have a Tesla robot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 11:53:39'] Hyping overpriced tech is his lively hood‚Ä¶.Well that and Trolling twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:03:22'] This is because he's a salesman/con man and less of an entrepreneur than he makes himself out to be.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 16:31:25'] He has more ideas and is willing to put his money down to fund them. There just aren't enough hours in the day for him to do it all.  His companies routinely cannot hire and retain talent, and the requirements are for fields that don't really exist but expect phd level professionals in.  Sorry no one is a 10 year veteran of making walking, talking and problem solving robots or self driving cars.  It's all new and you need really smart people to do these jobs and pioneer them.  More than any of that though he needs a better pipeline for getting the talent he wants.  Universities are dead ends.  Recruit from highschools or professions and train them to be what you need.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 04:28:54'] Yeah, that's kinda his thing, that's his whole ass brand. He has absolutely nothing to show but gags, toys, gimmicks that don't work, and his army of fanbois.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 21:52:50'] That was some lame robot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 01:22:45'] Of course. Musk is a hype man. Tesla is the most valuable automaker in the world (by stock value anyway) solely because of him. They don't make more cars than anyone else. They don't make faster, better, or significantly safer cars than anyone else. Tesla is worth what it is because Elon Musk sold his investors this image of rocket ships and space and tunnels and the future will be bright and perfect with Tesla at the front. Everyone believes him, and simultaneously forgets what he promises to deliver. It's easy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 00:29:34'] And he ties some of his companies value to cryptocurrency when he‚Äôs publicly being shorted to increase volatility. He‚Äôs playing a game.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 05:40:14'] The smart thing would be to hold back announcements for several projects until you needed some form of damage control and release one then. Is that the case with him though? Idk just thoughts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 06:00:34'] He loves a good piece of misdirection. Remember when there were reports of a whistleblower at Tesla‚Ä¶ and so Lord Edge released a fucking cybertruck shaped whistle to fuck with Google searches about it. The best part we‚Äôre the fanboys claiming it wasn‚Äôt a ploy but actually just a really cool whistle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 06:30:34'] It isn‚Äôt you.  It‚Äôs a way for him to sway potential new investors, reward his current investors, and to make ex-investors regret leaving.  Although, stocks are a year by year game and not a day by day game.  So, they plan this stuff in advance by using predictions and projections of the market.  He might not be an engineer but he‚Äôs got a nack for convincing gullible people that he is.  He‚Äôs not a genius, just manipulative.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 23:01:24'] Before I say this, just know I used to like Elon as a teen but now I'm a socialist and Elon Hater and I lurk this sub because I find it funny. But PLEASE think so you don't loose your money. Tesla is held up by carbon credits and it is billions of dollars over valued. It's valued as a tech company over a car company, car companies that are 10x the scale have cheaper market caps and are valued not as highly as Tesla. Sales for Tesla's are going down as more and better car companies are getting into the EV field. Tesla is almost entirely extrinsically valued, it could crash to it's actual price at any moment. We're seeing tech companies in the stock market fall constantly because of the extrinsical value they hold. Tesla is also collateral for Twitter and twitter is already loosing money and the interest is over a billion dollars. With a little analysis it should be clear that Tesla is not looking good in the long run.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 18:27:02'] People are realizing the issues and limitations of EVs and some are finally realizing that they hurt the environment even more than gas cars. But mainly Elon is having issues with autonomous self driving vehicles. Lots of crashing and EVs bursting into flames, the technology isn't there yet it's very difficult to program self driving cars. It's probably just the macroeconomic climate though that is causing his sell off of his own stocks. There's a reason he's doing what he's doing with Twitter, to try to make more and retain the title of world's richest man because Tesla isn't doing it.

Even if he gets to Mars it will be an endless money pit for the next 500 years. No money in the world can cover rebuilding even small part of our civilisation on another planet. Just look where we are with the Moon. So he will keep selling Tesla stock till it gets to value of Ford just to cover his and his family basic need for couple generations. He's got a big family to feed and support.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 23:03:06'] An interesting observation.There are two outliers...... see the red and green dots in late 2020 just by themselves.The green dot, the buy is just before the sell which is lower than everything else. Some findings.....So the buyer managed to buy at a rate much lower than the market rate. But got impatient, or didn't get the memo to hold, and sold shortly at a loss, still well beneath the market rate. It may be possible to identify the buyer and seller, presumably if anyone has the trade data. The number of shares on each side should be the same.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:59:23'] Not trying to be a dick but wouldn‚Äôt most large tech corporations look like this? Why would insiders be buying stocks when they‚Äôre handed out for free to ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù? I‚Äôd imagine the proportion is mostly sell for  employees. But not sure what this is defining as an ‚Äúinsider‚Äù.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 16:54:11'] Your graph does show what you intended, that insiders are selling a lot and buying very little.However, it also shows that insiders are not magic, and they aren't exempt from missing something or making mistakes.Look at the last insider purchase. Now watch as insiders sell all the way from 75 to the very top. If they were magical market makers, they wouldn't have sold at 100, 150, 250, 350, etc. They would have held right until about 425 and then dumped and made a killing. But they don't know when things stop going up, just as they don't know when things stop going down.They aren't buying at these levels despite a huge dump. Should they be? Time will tell. Maybe Tesla reverses from here, makes some announcements, Twitter gets a new CEO, rates stall, earnings are incredible, and Tesla rises from here to 1,000 over the next few years. We would be able to look back on this graph and think "these idiot insiders didn't buy at all! What do they know?"So time will tell. Insiders look dumb in retrospect for selling shares at 75 when things ultimately went above 400. Will they look equally dumb for not buying as much as they can get their hands on at these levels?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:49:23'] This chart looks similar to other large cap tech stocks (FAANG). That‚Äôs because these companies use stock based compensation as a significant part of the compensation package of employees/insiders. Insiders don‚Äôt need to buy to have a significant portion of their assets in stock - they just get granted options, and eventually they want to convert this to cash to pay expenses or taxes on the options grants. So most insider transactions in growth stocks generally are sells.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 21:11:00'] This is why the market needs tighter regulations. You have gambled away what most people retire with. You are the problem. And don't give me that crap about "its his choice". Its shit like this that makes people afraid to invest because what it does to vol. You deserve everything you get. Think about who you could of help, the food you could of brought for less fortunate, years of rent for families that truly need the help. TL:DR - You selfish bastard, at least give some to your momma before you blow yourself up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 17:28:35'] I just want to know why you didn‚Äôt decide to donate 25,000 to 18 random members on this sub and force them to trade it $0 or not stop until they make $75k profit. You take 50k. And the regard keeps 25k profit.This would be a great social experiment to show that giving money to us degens will be better spent than YOU losing it all yourself.I rather take a 1 in 18 chance that one of these degens would walk away with $100kBut instead you decided to be greedy.

I'm up but I'm not sure if I should stick with the leveraged fund or just sell and buy some more TSLA. \n\nHas anyone in the group had any experience with TSLL or a similar fund?\n\nI've looked into it and it's odd that it has the 1.5 multiplier but only 27% of the holdings are TSLA stock. What are the other holdings? Are they options that are owned by banks?\n\nI think this is a really cool concept that allows options play without options risk. Any insight would be appreciated.\n\nThanks everyone!"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 13:57:42'] You'll get better answers in r/letfsSingle stocks are already riskier than LETFs though. Single stock LETF is very risky. You're kind of asking for it. Take profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 12:55:03'] >It's definitely a risky investment, but if you're comfortable with that then it could be worth sticking with it. I don't have any personal experience with this particular fund, but from what I can tell the other holdings are mostly Tesla options and some cash. So yes, there is definitely potential for huge gains (or losses) depending on how Tesla stock performs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 12:59:46'] Also, how does a fund like this impact the stock price. Theoretically, when people buy stock, the price goes up. Does pirchasing this fund impact the value of TSLA when being purchased?

Although, you have to write off against future gains (or $3K/year on income which can be a while).  (If you sell, you need to not buy TSLA for 30 days in any account to avoid wash sale rules.)If you are dead set on praying for TSLA, sell half now and if you want to stay in the automotive EV game... maybe buy F.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:48:39'] buy Tesla Puts before earnings call to make back some money. (Buy a week prior as Tsla may see some correction from here)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:49:46'] @OP Sell it all and take the tax benefits this year. Beginning of February buy back in if you still believe in them. To be honest, my advisor sold all my tsla about a month ago and told me after he did it, I was pissed. He explained it was for tax losses and I cooled off because it kept going down and down. He saved me about $40k in losses, bagged some losses, and at this point even if it goes up a bit before I buy back in, I‚Äôm still damn glad he did.

It then burns their hopes and dreams to the ground in the lead up to tax year end, ruining many people‚Äôs holidays and in many cases blowing up college funds, house deposits and setting individual financial situations back by years.Astoundingly, the company has managed achieve this whilst its unorthodox but transparent founder has quite publicly sold almost $23 billion worth of his own stock at ridiculously expensive valuations in the last 8 months. All this whilst the broader ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô investment analysis industry has tied itself in knots inventing narratives to spin this simple fact into something more positive than it really is.

There is no self driving car that can do what tsla does, and they are so far ahead!

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 07:28:21'] Today's volume on TSLA options was quite high, with over 39 million contracts traded. The vast majority of these were puts, which indicates that many investors are betting that the stock will fall in value in the near future. However, there were also a significant number of calls traded as well, indicating that some believe the stock will rise. Overall, it seems like there is considerable uncertainty about where Tesla's stock price will go in the next few months. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

Other thing to consider is taxes, idk if you had other trades. Is it worth it to pay short term gains this year or next? I can't foresee it getting a lot better for Tesla in the next week so not sure if that would influence your decision... If you sell one now and one next year you have short term capital gains in both years

That said, this option is already deep in the money, you should close, take some profit, and reload an some options that are out of the money, maybe a few that are far out of the money so that you can make more on the volatility. Buy some calls to capitalize on the volatility along the way. If this is a lot of money for and you want to keep playing definitely run a straddle so you don‚Äôt get fucked on a random big day.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:37:19'] Most people are telling you to sell, but I'm not so sure, OP. Those contracts are so deep in the money that their value is almost 100% intrinsic, so your position is functionally equivalent to being short 200 shares. You don't really need to worry about delta, theta, IV etc. unless TSLA gains ~30%. Not that there isn't risk to holding, but if you think TSLA is still going to go lower it should be fairly safe to set a 10-15% stop loss and let it ride.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 14:17:41'] I would for sure hold for about another month. Holding it too long tho could be risky as Tesla doing pretty well business wise even tho it‚Äôs not correlating with its stock. I can see Tesla‚Äôs stocks getting near 100$ a share within the next few months. After Tesla gets close to that 100$ mark I would sell because it will shoot back up. If Tesla is able to get momentum I would sell quick because the stock will skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 14:47:58'] Sell, because if you really want to make more money, even if TSLA drops to 100 dollars and suffers a 20% drop, you won't make significantly more, but if you take profits and find a different play that has less chance of a rebound bounce post tax loss selling when we enter january, you can find ways to multiple your gains far more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:05:35'] I guess that depends on when the expiration is. I‚Äôm not convinced that we‚Äôre going to see a rally after earnings. Earnings may fall well short of anticipation. I also find it unlikely that we will see much of a rally between Christmas and New Year‚Äôs. You don‚Äôt want Theta Burn so maybe sell part of the position. You can always buy more puts before earnings.

Took 1/3 paid toward our new car  payment because of 5.77% nterest rate.  So I gain that 5 percent. Gave some as gift to fam and save for tax. The other we partied and went to Europe for 10days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 14:06:52'] from a TA standpoint TSLA could drop all the way to like 105 and that still would be higher lows than the last set of lows, higher highs than the last set of highs, and tsla would still be in an uptrendi think it probably bounces off resistance at like 185 level and stays up, but TSLA is a very volatile stock so its pretty hard to call. this is why this sub likes betting on its, one way or the other, because it moves alot and it moves fast

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 09:08:53'] Tesla's stock price is expected to increase significantly over the next year, based on technical indicators. The PSAR (0.02, 0.2) suggests that the stock price will continue to rise in the short-term, while the SMA (10), SMA (50), and SMA (200) all suggest that Tesla's stock price will continue to trend upwards over the long-term. Furthermore, earnings are expected to be strong in 2023, which should provide additional support for Tesla's stock price appreciation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:13:42'] What are these green numbers you show me
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:12:02'] Update: I sold half my stake and will hold the other half.  I'll be back if I run into any more dilemmas üòâ
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:17:02'] Is it Twitter that made you consider selling TSLA ??? 2 times lower than ATH??? ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:26:41'] Considering you are up well over the initial investment, sell half and leave the other half in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:32:09'] I just guaranteed that TSLA will rally, I sold all my shares
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:33:22'] Sell half, let the rest ride
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:26:47'] I mean, if you're holding it for another 20 years, should be ok. If not, gtfo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:33:59'] Bro take your profit and help my puts
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:17:16'] Hold because no one gives a shit about what happens. That being said, do the opposite of what I say because I haven't seen green in years
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:19:00'] The real question here is are you on edge to sell?Let me explain... If you can withstand the price dropping further and still holding them maybe a short term news shouldn't be taken so seriously, But if when the stock goes down more you will just sell not wanting to see your gains disappear then you can consider selling
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:25:29'] I would, you can always get back in once there is some stability...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:37:35'] Gain is a gain, i would take half and maybe buy one call very otm in case tsla moon

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:14:25'] It's peaked....take your gains and run.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:55:39'] Do you need money? If no then hold. It just went down 30%+ in 3 months. I bought more TSLA today personally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:50:22'] Don‚Äôt let drama influence a market decision. TWTR is a drama situation that will subside with due time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:04:00'] Did you ever take profits before? Just curious
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:43:02'] As a general rule, if you aren‚Äôt confident in a position, take the principal or half (whichever is greater) off the table leaving profit in play, study the position from a more neutral standpoint and reevaluate. And remember: No one ever went broke taking profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 13:01:30'] If Musk can‚Äôt make Twitter profitable, then he‚Äôll have to sell more Tesla shares to pay interest in the loan he took out to buy Twitter.  If you think he can turn Twitter into a profitable company, hold.  If not, then sell.  Sucks that you now have to factor in the health of some totally inflated company into your Tesla decision but here we are.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 14:58:24'] To the extent one random persons perspective matters, as much as I think Elon is an a-hole I love my Tesla and plan to continue to buy Teslas into the foreseeable future because the car is really incredibly well made and has saved me a ridiculous amount of money on gas. Further, a lot of the cars are made in the US and employ a lot of people in the US which I also support. I think a lot of people will be in my same camp. Plenty of a-hole CEOs with a great product that brings jobs to the US. So I see the stock price recouping after this whole twitter debacle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 08:27:33'] If Tesla stock dips, then buy more Tesla! They're a successful company with cars being built by scientists and engineers. It's not just Elon Musk's company nor is he the one making the actual cars, he's just the main investor. Tesla employs alot of people in the U.S, and is currently spearheading the initiative to make trucks lithium powered. Don't ever lose your position unless you're absolutely sure a company is going bankrupt. And even then, bunkruptcy isn't always the end: if the government announces a bail out, that means they have faith ib or a desire to keep that company open. Wasteland Management for example went bankrupt in the 90's due to Mafia corruption. Now it's one of the most reliable garbage stocks you can hold. Sometimes, unpopular companies such as PG&E of California are propped up due to necessity- despite being wrongfully blamed for a wildfire that some resident started with his propane tank, PG&E is the only company established enough to handle electricity for all of southern California's wildfire prone areas. - it's not their fault that global warming is causing drier seasonsand excessive heat waves. That's why PG&E is still alive and well despite the 2018 backlash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:19:08'] Dont be a quitter
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:31:45'] They already have enough capacity in development (Berlin and Texas ramp) double current capacity without expansion of other factories. They also just started manufacturing at the new megapack factory which once fully ramped will 10x current pack manufacturing. Can‚Äôt speak on share price without some speculation, but I think a pe of 50 is fair given the companies growth and growth forecasts. With that said tesla has almost always traded at a premium since 2019, so it sitting at a pe of ~65 is not very extreme. I‚Äôm comfortable holding at these prices, but there is a gap from here to ~150/share although I don‚Äôt like using TA as a main point just something to keep in mind.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:59:15'] I wouldn't let the opinion of a bunch of people who's highest ROIs came from them skipping lunch a time or 2, be a factor in any decision. A man doesn't become the richest person in the world by being dumb, and that's simply a fact.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:30:58'] Hold. You won‚Äôt regret
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:29:05'] lol all the tsla fucboi in this thread trying to sell you hopium.  look at the macro conditions and tell me if youre bullish in 2023.  will it eventually reach ath again? sure, its possible, is this the bottom? no, we still have more rate hike and at least 6months of 5%+ before they would consider lowering it.  if you can afford to keep dead money until it eventually recover, then hold it, companies are way more likely to recover than go out of business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 13:50:19'] +487%? Pssh don‚Äôt sell for less than +600%. I‚Äôm sure Tesla will continue to skyrocket forever, after all their cars never catch on fire or crash into people and their CEO is such a stable, intelligent businessman.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:15:10'] I am holding/adding. the upside is so much larger than the downside.  It may have been worth considering when it was 1000+ presplit but now you would just be selling at a likely low.  Some say it could go to 150, I'm not sure about that but I'm a buyer either way
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:30:11'] Depends if you like loss porn or not. I‚Äôm sure there were people on the titanic who thought they would have enough boats for everyone. So they politely waited their turn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:41:40'] I would book some profits in this market. Fed is still hawkish and I feel there is a big china risk to Tesla. if US-China relationship goes south, I see big risk for all china heavy companies including Apple and Tesla. Especially Tesla with a huge factory in Shanghai making more cars than Fremont.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:05:00'] yeah dawg you should have sold at 1200 when musk started dumping. The overvaluation of that equity was insane. realistically they have just lost their cult following. And the rest of the big boys are getting ev's out now too

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 12:51:40'] I‚Äôd get out because it‚Äôs a hyper inflated stock betting on a psychopath, take your healthy 4x and run. Before the fundamentals catch up and you see red.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:40:43'] First: if you make money you dont belong here bud.Second: chart on tesla looks hella bad. Tsla has always been a technical play, no fundamentals for obvious reasons. So i would take my money in a rally. Tsla is one bad move from one guy and its stock crashes‚Ä¶That being said, you dont have a lot of money so it may be better also to hold just for the hair loss emotions that come with massive swings. It really is an addictive feeling‚Ä¶all up to you at the end.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:40:22'] Twitter isn't the deciding factor here.  Competition with every company being forced to transition to electric is the deciding factor.Tesla is going up against companies with over a century of experience developing and manufacturing vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:29:38'] The sensible thing to do, is sell now, and if you still believe in it, buy back with a portion at a lower point in some months. Realistically, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll hit or pass the ATH anytime soon. Looking at either the Tech or the Auto market space, Tesla is overvalued where it sits now.   But this is WSB, so buy more and ride it down to 0% if you have to.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:34:58'] TSLA is still doing more for renewables and green energy than anyone else. Ignore "timelines" and estimates, but Tesla is likely going to have the first Level 5 autonomous vehicle.Elon the man is just a crazy idiot, but Tesla offers amazing products.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:37:49'] Red hydrogen and twitter. The Japanese/korea markets are really steering towards clean hydrogen which is feasible now on a large scale
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:01:20'] Hold on for your life man.  Twitter is one of the biggest advertising platforms on the planet and Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise‚Ä¶ yet.  Starlink, Twitter, Space-X‚Ä¶. In a decade you‚Äôll regret dropping it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:55:19'] Get out. Musk will throw every dollar into a dying Twitter to appease his Ego.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:22:48'] Yes now is time to get out. Elon is unhinged.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:33:01'] Bro sell that shit.  Tesla had a first to market competitive advantage.  Their market share is being eroded because other companies are making electric cars now.  Not to mention Teslas are shit quality compared to EVs produced by other manufacturers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:20:42'] Selling at the current bottom of a wildly fluctuating market?  You‚Äôve been holding for years why sell now?  If the Market turns around and it ends up they have 2 factories and 2 new products coming online in the next 2 years are you gonna be happy you sold now?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:42:01'] Elon Musk is the poster boy for /r/overemployed, now running three major companies and several smaller ones.  As anyone who is overemployed will tell you, the trick is to do everything half-ass, just good enough not to get fired.  Time to get out while you can.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:31:22'] Take out your initial investment and play with the houses money; If/When it drops, just buy the shares back that you sold for a cheaper price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:36:33'] You hold of course.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:57:53'] To be honest. At this point I would get out. They are going to go on a steady decline now. All of their patents are open. They shot up because they were an early mover and a market disrupter. Now that GM, Ford, ETC. All the major companies have comparable EV's there is no real appeal to TSLA anymore. Atleast for me. Elon is on his own path following down Kanye West's footsteps. Sad really.   Money changes people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:08:13'] We did not take delivery of our $122k Tesla because of what an ass Elon is.  I think there are more people than just my family that feels the same way. We are looking at the Mercedes EV, pretty hot car.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:41:48'] Dude they are two separate companies. Why do you think the two stocks are correlated? If Tesla has a strong earnings report and Twitter does not, you think Tesla will go down because of Twitter?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:42:52'] Should have sold a long time ago. It‚Äôs going to $50
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:43:06'] The market is looking at the twitter shitstorm and thinking "oh shit he's worse than we thought" and frankly the now > 4% risk free rate looks appealing when even TSLA is down 50% from the high and the tech companies are getting taken out back and shot. TSLA may be the OG meme stock and take many many shots out back before dying back to a reasonable price to earning multiple. As more and more of this sets in and the price loses another $20 or $25 , Musk needing to sell stories will crash the price further and on and on. Or if you think I'm wrong, hold on. Or best yet, sell half.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 13:12:00'] That's a pickle. You saw your investment go up 100x. Then you saw it go down 65 percent. You can sell now for a sweet gain of about 10x. But later on it will be worth more. It's going to be 60 bucks within the next year. But later on it might be over 200 again. I would ask the swing traders to help me with entry and exit. But yeah definitely get the fuck out before the bottom.

This began with [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/07/elon-musk-faces-a-15-billion-tax-bill-which-is-likely-the-real-reason-hes-selling-stock.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/07/elon-musk-faces-a-15-billion-tax-bill-which-is-likely-the-real-reason-hes-selling-stock.html) not Twitter and each time Musk is asked if he's done selling he says yes. Then new circus things happen and he sells more.People who are rich because of their shares in one company aren't as wealthy as they seem. How do you get all that money without tanking the price? You really have to ask how much a stock would be expected to go down when the founder is cashing out in the billions. And is he really done yet?

There's a rumor on the street that he has his own personal chemist to make him research chemicals. My theory is these outbursts are due to a bad batch's and he doesn't have anyone around him who is a good enough friend to moderate his behavior. Personally if I was doing that stuff and had this much influence/power I would pay someone to do all my outward facing social media for me to act as a buffer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 21:33:43'] Bro about to lose it all!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 05:30:32'] It beats me how people get into Long positions after a stock has had a substantial run up. TSLA went from $144 to $210 in a week. Wouldn't common sense dictate to wait for substantial pull back before going in? I guess losing money is an addiction. Why buy at the top of the market?You may be lucky this time but that's one heck of a gamble you are taking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 06:02:07'] Luck favors the Brave. Good luck OP!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 13:12:18'] Stock is under 200$ mark atm, daily MACD signaling downtrend, broke the trend line since 100$ bull run.Good luck bro
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 12:49:22'] I would recommend selling the TSLA MAR 17 2023 $220 CALL position. The stock has been on a downward trend lately, and it does not seem like it will recover anytime soon. Plus, with the recent drop in value, you are likely to lose money if you hold onto this position.

You‚Äôll notice an article from cnbc last week confirmed spaceX recently raised another round at a higher valuation (100+ bn) from none other than a16z. So this puts musks paper spaceX stake around 20-25 billlion. A16z you‚Äôll recall put $500 million into the twitter deal. It‚Äôs all just one big ole circle jerk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 08:16:11'] I guess my question is why are people mad? The way I think of it, if the person did a good job at the first facility why should elon need to hire a different person to make the one here? What's wrong with him bringing that guy from China to build the one in America? Is it because he is Chinese? Would it be different if it was someone from the EU? Genuine question, lots of a subtle racism in these comments

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 11:15:02'] The better productivity out of the Chinese factory is not from the better methodology of management. It‚Äôs from the mentality of the Chinese workers who are competing for the jobs like a hunger game every single day.

In which case Tom Zhu will have limited ability to turn them around since we don‚Äôt allow 12 hour shifts here.Also that good will Elon has built up with republicans recently will evaporate soon over this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 07:39:02'] China values coming home to USThx Elon!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 07:12:45'] It's important to remember that the workers coming to the Texas factory will be coming to the US legally and will have the same rights and protections as any other worker in the country. It's also worth noting that the workers will likely be bringing valuable skills and experience to the factory, which can only benefit the company and its operations. It's always positive to see companies bringing in diverse perspectives and talents to help drive their success.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 07:34:38'] But he will continue to pay him wages based on his Chinese pay scale. So $5/week. Elon can't find cheap enough labor here so he is going to import it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 03:26:46'] This is just another example of how Elon Musk and Tesla are leading the way in innovation and setting the standard for other companies to follow. Their commitment to excellence is evident in everything they do, and I'm sure their new gigafactory in Austin will be no different.

Manufacturing requires skilled, experienced educated workers and managers. For years American companies have been taking huge depreciation tax credits; but outsourcing the actual work. Its been all about labor arbitrage. These same companies and their purchased sock puppet politicians-- then moan and pretend that China "stole" their manufacturing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 15:25:41'] Silly and wrong, price will hit $400 before $40.  In the last two years Tesla has centralized production, taken control of it‚Äôs supply chain and innovated quicker then it‚Äôs peers.  This type of re-investment will produce profit and growth that dwarf the industry.  Much like Apple‚Äôs dominance during the Great Recession.  They watch their competitors dwindle away and then shaped the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 12:04:05'] Tesla is expected to do around $5B+ in net income in Q4. That's a 117% growth rate over Q4 2021. Annualized, it's $20B which at $40 a share ($126B market cap) would give Tesla a PE of 6.3 and a PEG rating of 0.05. Large caps tend to have PEG traditionally have PEG ratings well above 1. To my knowledge, there's never been a stock in the S&P500 with a PEG that low.Tl;dr: You are either trolling, or you're the biggest idiot I've seen on this forum so far, and that's saying a LOT!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 12:45:12'] bruh, I dont think shorting tesla is the smartest idea eh
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 15:01:20'] Lol. I've been against Tesla's market cap for years, unfortunately, and I don't see them going to $40. As it stands right now, EV is considered the future, and Tesla is way ahead of competition. Their once ridiculous P/E valuation of 1800 has already been brought down to 78. Still a lot, but who is to say it won't be 50 next year? Or 30? Governments worldwide stimulate people to drive EV by giving all kinds of tax advantages. The orders just keep coming in for them. And with Sleepy Joe being pro-environment, looking to exchange government cars with EV, of course he'll give the deal to Tesla over any foreign manufacturer. Nah, I realize I made a mistake not following the mass and buying Tesla stocks in 2020/2021. Now they've got the trucks coming in with the Tesla Semi. I think they're just gonna boom even further. But what do I know, I'm just a WSB degenerate ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 17:34:38'] For what it's worth I'm not dumb enough to buy $40 puts next week but I did snag that 2025 $5 put. lol. I'm not even kidding. And just for good measure I bought spreads on puts ranging from November 11th all the way to January with $100 strike none of them cost more than 10 bucks. I've got more chance at making money there than buying lottery or going to the casino. And since it's less than $200 invested I can burn that in a night out on strippers and booze! So my loss porn is dismal compared to the outlandish scenario in which Tesla even comes close to $100. Picked up 50 contracts for 2 weeks out too. $100 strike. I embody the Reddit Ape. I shall fullfill my duty and buy the options that most are either too smart to touch or too dumb to understand the underlying 99.9% probability of pure worthlessness of the contracts.  Furthermore, I shall buy $300 dollar calls that are equal to or less than the premium I paid for the puts. Checkmate Elon!  (trades flat for 6 months)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 06:01:42'] Don't disagree although the price target is hard to determineI'd be waiting for a retest to the gap at \~$350 from below first, then probably buy 2025 puts of 100 strike  Meme and volatile stocks should be drawn and channeled on logarithmic scales in my opinion
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 21:00:00'] Remember big money always wants a good entry position before it turns direction, especially on smaller time frames- shorting is not dangerous unless your inexperienced and haven't made thousands of trades and use a stop loss and target exit- i trade tesla options everyday and been trading 11 years, in and out - do your homework

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 12:29:33'] TSLA is the most overvalued stock in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 16:13:14'] I believe, and everyone in here will disagree, but Tesla defies the theory of an efficient market. All, or most is known, still the stock trades way too high. Looking at fundamentals, competitors, the world economy, capacity, changed regulations in key markets.. All points at an overvalued stock. I know, not getting many upvotes for this, but reality will hit. I experienced the dot com crash, not comparing, but believe me when I say reality will hit. So holding on to my short from $311.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 12:08:00'] Their stock price is just crazy.  They ship 10% of the number of cars of major automakers but their market cap is 10x.  Sure they were the only quality EV producer for a while but now everyone and their mother sells them, for less.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 13:03:06'] Tesla is insanely high-priced for an auto company. It's a tech company? Then so is General Motors. Tesla has been at nosebleed valuations for years and never fell to Earth, but now interest rates are increasing. Speculation about the next millennium is no longer financed at zero percent interest. Now every automaker on planet earth is rushing into the EV space, potentially crowding out QC challenged Tesla. Now other automakers from Lucid to GM to the Korean Megacorp are blowing Tesla's technology into the weeds. Meanwhile, Musk's wildly oscillating political stances potentially are alienating everyone.So short Tesla? Hell no. Who knows what Musk comes up with next? In particular a lot of EVs need a lot of chargers and Tesla has a lot of chargers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 09:00:19'] Since industry professionals go on live TV to promote a company they know absolutely nothing about.I can only assume they are as regarded or more so than I am in doing 0 research and talk out my ass in assuming that Elon has Tesla as collateral loan for Twitter, so if Twitter tanks in value or cost him money, lending party may require more down payment, or he just needs to sell stock to fund twitter operating cost.Again, I did absolutely 0 research and was thinking about shorting Tesla as Twitter drama escalates waiting for a better entry point. So industry experts likely already set sail.

POST_TEXT: b"I recently went to look into Tesla's current price action and analyzed its Fair Value based on its current fundamentals and market environment. With the use of DCF and other evaluation methods, I [estimated](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/10b64p5/tsla_tesla_evaluation_fundamental_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Tesla **per share fair value of 83 dollars**, with 20% error margin in both uptrend and downtrend. It is hard to know when the market will discount out all the hype, dreams and lunacy. It might be next week, next month or next year.\n\nThere are many risks and treats to the company than its strengths and opportunities. Bagholders and dreamers are keeping the price up with the narrative that the firm is a Tech company, which it isn't.\n\nIts P/E is way inflated than its peers. Other developments in the company is more like a side quest to attract investors and try to disguise itself as a Tech Company. Strangely, Tesla's Management is unloading"

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 03:42:54'] nice analysis, ill add my qualitative two cents for why i never even got to a DCF analysis of Teslaas someone who really likes cars, i always stayed away from tesla as an investment because traditional car makers have an entire lifecycle of development, support, replacement for their models and very little margins (compared to tesla) afterwards.secondly the cars whilst packaged nicely are fairly basic in amenities, i find both the interiors and exteriors boring. auto driving never interested me because i get bored if I'm not driving myself, and the silly acceleration figures are pointless in 99% of driving.thus i came to the conclusion that there must be something i must be completely missing out in teslas valuation, which means i dont understand the business and hence never invested in it.if tesla keeps tanking, and they can display some kind of generational leap in their model replacements in the next year or two, with greater creature comforts, and more attractive designs i would consider it a potential buy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 14:30:53'] TSLA went up way more than it rationally should have, so I could see it doing the same the other way. TSLA $20 wouldn‚Äôt be a shock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 06:06:25'] $80 is my guess too but I really did just guesstimate.  I'm also guessing there will be a drop in a few weeks cause tsla bulls folded twice after a month of resistance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 19:17:50'] Fair value is closer to $20 than $83
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 22:50:13'] This is one of the worst DD‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever seen. Which means it‚Äôs perfect for this sub. Well done.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 09:39:05'] It‚Äôs not a tech company, but it‚Äôs not a standard car company either so any analysis on the stock price based on that assumption is going to be flawed from the get go It‚Äôs a growing car company in a growth industry. Legacy car companies are coming up with EV models and growing their EV business, but their sales are coming at a cannibalization of sales to their ICE businesses Also Tesla has only produced sedans and SUVs until recently. In the past few weeks, you have the Tesla semi release, and in the next few years you can expect them to enter the pickup truck and compact car marketsAlso no mention of RSI in your analysis, with the daily/weekly/monthly RSI numbers all currently in the 30s, all indicating that it‚Äôs still on the brink of being considered oversold
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 10:14:06'] shorting tesla is like shorting appleget ready to be destroyed
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 08:31:33'] These recent price cuts are the first phase of acceptance for TSLA becoming just another car company Margins decline and making profits become harder as they try to accelerate growth to hold on to and capture more EV market share. Bottom line is there will be better options in the EV world coming to a theater near you soon. And the world is not in a rush to buy them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 11:03:05'] I would rather react to breaking key support or resistance levels before opening any new positions. Plus earnings are coming up in 01/25. It could easily rip and blow up your account. Inversing wsb works, so I might look for a long now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 02:41:27'] Sounds more like jacking up the prices to maximise profits has reduced sales, let's go back to original prices
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 10:51:23'] I recently read that Tesla made $9,500 profit per car sold in 2022.  If these discounts stick around for long, that‚Äôs gonna put a rather large dent in their earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 06:39:11'] I wonder how many customers will be pissed to know that they spent $13k more for something last year than it would have cost them this year.  Not to mention that the Model 3/Y qualify for the $7500 tax credit now whereas it didn't last year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 04:45:31'] Even if they did sell the amount of cars they said they would, wouldn't the 20% discount mean less revenue? How is it that the number of units sold is more important then their profit margins?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 07:57:37'] Some math for those who don‚Äôt quite get how discounts work: in order to not lose revenue when giving a 20% discount, you need to sell 25% more cars than prior to the discount. And if that works is a function of price elasticity. That in turn, is a function of numerous conditions, incl. how close potential customers are to pulling the trigger, what is the competition doing, etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 21:16:09'] The biggest issue with these price cuts that delusional bulls are selectively ignoring is the "actual number by which prices were slashed". They could have easily gamed the system by keeping model 3 and 5 seat model Y just under 55K and 7 seat model Y much higher but still under 80K. But if you look carefully, they have cut prices way more than that. That is stupidity. The demand would have been equally good if they targeted those 55K threshold cleverly. Yes, they are still better off than other car makers but then the Stock price cannot be like 10 times more than others. The stock price needs to be cut in half! t is all about valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 15:38:16'] They have to lower prices because buyers aren‚Äôt getting a tax credit anymore. So Tesla will eat the difference. Further, Tesla itself has spent a long time getting double credits per car from the government, because other companies were not selling EVs. As the other carmakers sell EVs that revenue stream will also dry up (if it hasn‚Äôt already, I‚Äôm not sure of the current situation). This means Tesla bringing in something like $15-20K less revenue per vehicle sold. Which is‚Ä¶ a lot. And prices are even lower in China where a ton of future sales are expected to be. This means that even if Tesla can meet the crazy predictions for unit sales growth, it won‚Äôt translate into nearly as much earnings growth. There will be heavy long-term downward pressure on the P/E.

Around late 2007 or early 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately 31% of Exxon Mobil's (highest market cap in the world - at that time). Apple's market cap has grown by an estimated 1,500% since 2007.

Let me tell you something, kiddo, if you're still referring to data from 2021, you might as well be using a crystal ball to predict the stock market.Listen, investing is serious business and it requires staying up to date with current events and trends. So, why don't you stop living in the past and start looking at the present? Tesla is a rapidly evolving company, and if you want to make informed investment decisions, you need to keep up with the latest news and updates.So, here's my advice to you, wise guy: Instead of relying on outdated data, do your homework and stay up to date. And, for the love of all that's holy, stop trying to pass off old news as something relevant. You're not fooling anyone, least of all the savvy investors out there

Great trade.If you think it's going lower, roll it down to 160 or so. Recoup your initial investment, and you're still in the game at a high delta if it continues down.If you're on the fence, roll it down even further. You're buying more extrinsic (and losing delta) the farther you roll but you're still in the game and a roll to 140 means you doubled your money *and* still have a 140 put on top of that.Personally, I'd roll to 140.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:35:16'] SELL1. Elon Musk is too volatile, and thus so are his stocks. Stay away from them.2. If it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to sell.3. You are going to ignore every comment on this thread telling you to sell, because you are greedy. When you lose it all you will wonder why.I already know 100% you‚Äôre not going to sell, idk why you even asked us because it doesn‚Äôt matter Nobody ever sells on here, even with the comments all shouting in unison ;-;
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:30:57'] Personally I would sell.  Tesla has fallen 40% ish in the last 2 weeks.  While I still feel it‚Äôs overvalued until it hits double digits, expecting further large falls is probably not going to happen.  While nobody knows for sure the future, until Tesla starts missing financial projections and/or delivers I think it won‚Äôt have many huge drops in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 03:55:48'] Just for the record: Stock price did go down when splits happened. Price histories are just corrected to reflect the split i.e. the history will also be corrected down to 1/5.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 11:14:16'] It‚Äôs still worth more than all other car makers combined.. IMO still very overvalued
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 13:04:14'] Still looks overpriced
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 13:58:53'] Still overvalued in my opinion. As he has to fund 6 other companies expect Tesla to drop harder then the rocks peoples elbow. I am expecting this to be under 100 sometime in the next few months with obviously some kick back. Depends on how the US's recession, Twitter, and the constant corona issues (like in china) stoking fear.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 21:29:55'] Tesla stock is a proxy for how much you believe in Elon Musk. As long as he's setting fires in the dumpsters out behind twitter the stock will continue to plummet and even then.He's basically decided to pivoting into insulting his customer base - well to do leftists who care about the environment at a time when every other car maker is rolling out EVs and from recent reports the Tesla brand quality assurance is in the toilet right now. I don't see a way Tesla recovers without getting rid of Elon completely.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 03:48:38'] Well, PE ratio of 35 (not the future PE). They have the cybertruck on the way.  They have started ramping the Semi.  But the deliveries collapse this quater and we are entering a recession. Still they have there own battery production which will allow them to produce electric vehicles more reliabily than the competition.   I think at half the current valuation then I would 100% be buying but I don't think they will ever get there. around 400 billion could be pretty far value if you expect them to grow next year. I think it will be a bad year for them, but 2024 and onwards will be better. I would wait.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 01:26:01'] Maybe pick up some and stick them in the sock drawer.If this is a rerun of the dot com boom and bust, many stocks never recovered. You are picking the next amazon basically back in 2000.I think there is a new bull market round the corner and we should be researching now for the strongest contenders. Hint, these stocks go up during a bear market, month after month.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 02:24:44'] Trading buy yes but longer investment term unknown. It is easy to look back in hindsight but the bubble has burst! My best guess is it will be dead money for a long time based on previous bubble busting stock. It can double (easily?) but still be in a bear market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 10:34:13'] Still overvalued, by a lot, especially in the macro backdrop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 12:18:10'] Long term?  1,000% overvalued.  Should be a $20 (or less) stock.  In 2023 if the delivery numbers disappoint, you're going to see it head down more.  Looks like short term might recover a bit more.  I'm rooting for a nice BIG short term "recovery" so make more $ shorting.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 10:42:27'] Tesla still has twice the PE of google or Apple or Microsoft with all time low backorder, a rising used market and declining sales. Tesla should still drop at least 50% from here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 03:47:16'] Is tesla worth more than all other car manufacturers worldwide combined? Look at the evaluation of toyota to see how deep tesla should fall.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 05:11:11'] If Musk doesn't get back on his meds and/or step down I'm not sure if Tesla will still exist in 10 years... between his behaviour, and the huge amount of competition from very experienced competitors coming this year I think Tesla is in trouble.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 12:09:32'] How the hell will they sell expensive cars with high interest rates?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 03:27:36'] Well last week was ugly because nobody knows what 2023 has in store for us. EV has taken a beating and recession fears are going to continue to beat it down!If Elin would focus on TESLA it would really help the share price but this Twitter side show is really hurting investor confidence in TESLA!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 08:39:56'] It's possible that Tesla will keep dropping for some time before it regains it's value, however one can never know. I'm planning on buying some Tesla if it dips below $100 a share. I'll start light, my goal would be 100 shares at most, and if it starts to build value over time I'd add more on the way

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 20:23:16'] Might go up, might go down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 21:26:24'] Still grossly overvalued. They are fundamentallyba car manufacturer. They produce one fifth the cars as GM, and should be worth 1 fifth GM by market cap. There are many reasons you can argue they are worth more than their sales, such as the growth in EVs or their batteries, but that should elevate their value by maybe 40^, not 4000%
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 02:01:12'] It's gonna go down the shitter
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 08:55:09'] Let's put it this way: Elong staged a theater play all year long in order to pull 50 billion out to put into his new safe haven TWTR.TSLA is not valued as a car producer, it is valued as a global provider of self driving mobility. But they didn't put LIDAR in because it was too expensive at the time. There will not be a self-driving Tesla, the Semi has zero real world usability. When the realization hit's that Tesla is merely a producer of electric cars, the stock value will break down to 1/10th.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 21:29:26'] TSLA belongs at $60 ( presplit $900) since more competition in 2023 andi personally will be looking to buy an Audi or Merc EV next year

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 00:15:21'] I think it‚Äôs great considering how hard it seems they‚Äôre working to meet their earnings call expectations, that‚Äôs why they put some of their cars on sales and even when you read Elons email to employees you can see he is trying to meet the earnings expectation. I would grab a couple shares right away and if earnings go bad just dca and wait for a good earnings call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 08:24:07'] Like asking if you should buy several thousand MegaMillions tickets‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. The company has a bright future if Elon Musk doesn‚Äôt mess it up.   The stock, however, is still wildly overvalued by any conventional investment analysis.Given the series of seemingly reckless decisions that Musk has made over the last year, he has tarnished his reputation with a lot of stock buyers.If you buy Tesla stock, use money you can afford to lose, just like you do when you buy lottery tickets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 09:32:09'] The biggest short term catalysts are the cars delivery report (Monday I believe), which sentiment seems to be divided on whether they hit estimate or not, and then earnings on the 25th of Jan.If both exceed, potential for a small rally. If both miss, likely a big drop. The fanboys keep claiming it‚Äôs got insane growth. These reports put their money where their mouth is.My personal bet is that they both miss, and that deliveries are well under the 450k estimate. Though it‚Äôs a small and speculative bet.

Tesla  has a lower forward P/E than CMG and LULU yet is growing revenues at 50% per year. Regardless of what industry they are in that type of growth commands a premium and always has.    Short term it may go up or down in the next year but long term there is little or no doubt  they company will surpass Apple especially if they get an actual CEO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 10:14:35'] Car sales are important but the real money maker will be the Tesla owned charging stations, car repairs/Tesla service centers, FSD sales/rental, insurance, expect other innovative monthly services/media streams.   Tesla semi both the current one and a future long distance one with truck leasing and all the other related services to be growing with even higher margins than the cars/trucks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 09:40:39'] Car company with giga factories that can build cars mostly with robots, which the power is provided from their own solar system. As purely a car company with their current sales, sure, you could argue it's overvalued currently, but Tesla also makes and is making other products that have a lot of value: solar power and power walls, robots (like irobot), cell phones (the CEO already has a massive satellite system) self driving cars for taxi business plus semi truck shipping. I'm probably forgetting a couple.Over all, I think many people will regret not DCA during this time, it could easily tank another 50% down to $60, but fast forward 10 years .. you will be wishing you didn't listen to all the idiots comparing it only to other car companies with old tech.

If you base it off the money supply to s&p500 ratio we are about 50% from where the bottom was in 2000 and 2008, so s&p would drop to 3-3.3k if history rhymes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 09:59:08'] Tesla will retrace back to the mid $200s over this next year and hopefully stabilize. The Twitter sideshow literally doesn‚Äôt matter to Tesla at all. Especially he Musk does what I expect he will do and step aside and let someone else hold the title of CEO. The big rigs hitting the market will be a huge catalyst to the upside. Nobody can argue that. Only dipshits will make the range argument, and that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre dipshits that don‚Äôt understand that the trailers will be equipped with batteries to extend the range to cross country and it will be a drop off / pick up situation with the next load having a fully charged trailer. Once the automation is really perfected those trucks won‚Äôt stop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 06:55:50'] I need to look at their Q4 report to know.Major factor for me to buy back in is:- If they success ramp 4680 battery production, then battery pack replacement for legacies Tesla will be dirt cheap. $5K battery replacement every 10 years definitely better than the current $19K~$22K replacement billing from some online pip who bought a used Tesla. EV already have low maintenance and the only expensive thing on people mind is the battery pack after all.They claimed to have ramp and made 800K cells in a period of 7 days recently (if true that‚Äôs a huge milestone consider they just hit a million and 10 million cells lately). IMO, I think Tesla is currently focus on volume production for battery before implementing new battery formula (their battery is still the old graphite ‚Äòanode‚Äô and NMC ‚Äòcathode‚Äô chemically based on the recent battery tear down not the new promised silicon based anode and iron based cathode on battery day presentation)Other EV makers so call ‚ÄúTesla killer‚Äù will have to make super dirt cheap EV to offset the need to battery replacement every 8-10 years period since no one include ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs union favorite‚Äù don‚Äôt have battery production planning in place at all. Alternatively they might have to swallow their pride and conform into Tesla battery structure design in order to use Tesla battery moving forward. Might as well using Tesla charging plug as well.I might entice in throwing in some chum change on some call options a couple days before their earning call for giggle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 11:35:51'] A number of things Aside from the Twitter debacle. First is the Tesla owner community is pissed on the design of the early models, AC units. It's above the battery, so it dumps water on the battery pack. It eventually corrodes through the steel and destroys the battery. The cost of repair is an average of $28k. There are a few boycotts going around in the Tesla community.The second part is the Ford Lightning. Being available to be a test bed for future EVs. One of the tests was towing. It takes EVs  300%-500% the amount of charge to tow 2000lbs-4000lbs. Efficiency goes out the window. This has led people to speculate the reason Cybertruck and Tesla Truck delays. The third part is competition. Specifically Hyundai is expected to be the new Champion of EVs. Their EV Ionic line is out pacing Tesla in sales. Others are betting on the Hyundai Hydrogen Hybrid System, they announced with the Concept Vision 74. Adding to the new interest in Rotary Hydrogen Engines being developed. There have been 2-3 different ones, so far And Last, it's the Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major electric hardness manufacturer. That's shut down. They are also the second richest European countries in terms of Lithium. It has caused the Lithium price to go up 220% and it's only going up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 09:50:52'] Looks like Elon is going to complete the purchase of Twitter at 44 Billion.  He was going to get lam-blasted and crushed for years over the law suits if he walked away.   Smart choice.&#x200B;A great buying opportunity for Tesla now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:38:17'] You can clearly see that the fib retracement levels align with the gap fill. The blue lines are anchored vwaps from the top that are dynamic support and resistances. The yellow box is an old chop zone and the red box is the main gap we created after earnings.&#x200B;Currently we are below the 200 and 50 ma on both daily and weekly timeframes.

POST_TEXT: b'The $378c was one I took at 2:40pm. I started out with a smaller position, and added more positions onto the continuous structure as long as we were above EMA every 5-10 min, and as soon as we broken above middle band of VWAP I added a lot more. I also waited for strong buying channels / volume. \n\nHowever, everytime I added my position I reset my SL to follow it. I had a 10% stop loss for half of the position if it hit, and if it hit 15% it would sell the rest of my position.\n\nAs we went higher, I just moved my SL right behind it. This way it let me take bigger risks, but I was still hedged\n\nThe others were plays I took as we rode the rollercoaster of hell downward in the first half of the day.'

Then in 3 months it will finally go back up to where I bought in and I‚Äôll have to debate on breaking even or holding in case it‚Äôs finally reversed. Because surely it won‚Äôt go back down. Then in that moment of weakness it touches my entry and immediately goes back down and I have to wait another 3-6 months for it to bounce back‚Ä¶if it ever does.

All automakers that have any kind of autonomous driving have this problem.Also if you are coming around a curve and there is a turnoff while on the curve, it will try to stop in the middle of the road instead of just continuing on.I submit a bug report to Tesla every time the cruise control panic brakes or slows down due to sunny weather.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:57:27'] They do this yearly.  Employees are paid a percentage of their salary in stock options.  If you have been there for 10 years, you have a large amount of money tied up in stock. Now let‚Äôs say you want to buy a house, you can‚Äôt just sell shares on the open market, so they do an offering every year to let employees cash out.

Their Starship is going to launch next year and that's going to be huge for future Starlink and other customers who want to launch lots of shit into space. I do wonder if Elon going to reduce his share of SpaceX to put some money in his pocket. Could be, but I'm thinking they are just issuing shares and raising cash here, which means Elon doesn't get a dollar.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:07:08'] I am not surprised that SpaceX is looking to raise money at a higher valuation. The company has been on an incredible growth trajectory in recent years and its future looks very bright. I believe the $77 per share price is fair, given the current market conditions and SpaceX's prospects. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 04:50:35'] I‚Äôd definitely consider investing in that just to invest in a piece of Starlink. Starlink is a huge game changer for rural areas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 05:08:17'] Starlink is growing and now being installed on RVs, yachts, cruise ships, and jets.SpaceX is always launching more payload for customers every week.StarShield just launched quietly and it is for government entities like the pentagon to use.The CEO is Gwynne Shotwell who doesn't tweet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 20:50:28'] Unfortunately Bloomberg is a political hack and so is the push his company makes on his behalf. Nothing like twisting facts to make a veiled political stance. I feel bad for who follows this asshole blindly into anything. Just like any other billionaire. Notice how they figured out how to fuck the short game once it got them good?  They will always find ways to manipulate in their favor.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 21:58:26'] I would do the same if I was expecting a multi year recession.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 02:02:52'] Probably gonna fall in price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:16:30'] I feel like at some point (this is total speculation with no research at all behind it) space x will struggle to make money and their stock will plummet. Less likely than with Tesla but at some point someone will catch up and space x won‚Äôt have the benefit of being the first anymore

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:02:33'] Wait till he sells the animal slaughterhouse
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 05:45:33'] Hot take: Starship is an absolute failure and spacex's reusable rockets haven't created the advertised cost savings get. You'd be an idiot to relaunch a rocket without first validating it hasn't been damaged by the intense heat and pressure of containing an internal explosion and traveling through the atmosphere at high speeds, and that validation / recertification process is a significant (like over 50%) of the cost of just building a new rocket.The SpaceX rockets are inferior capabilities and reliability at reduced cost, and that's about as far as their business will go. Replicating what was done many decades ago at a lower cost, but they don't have the ability to go further than that, not without any cost advantages disappearing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 06:34:03'] It is my understanding that you are asking about the Tesla stock and its recent price movements. As you may know, Tesla's share price has been volatile in recent months, but overall it has trended upwards. However, I believe that the company is due for a correction soon and would recommend caution if investing at this time.

Im down like a million dollars from Nov 2021 highs because I kept betting the trend would reverse.... instead of quiting and following the trend at some point. And/or listening to the crap advice I got from Morgan Stanley- and not cashing out my calls and buying QYLD. Id have lost a lot on QYLD but Id still have a bunch of Tesla shares and have a second income stream instead of holding my calls to zero then losing more trying to makeup the losses

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:12:23'] Very nice tea leaves, but fu dentally Tesla is sound. Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.

Almost no one saw it going as high as it did and almost no one saw it falling as far as it has.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 17:23:02'] Selling call spreads and put spreads with a short time horizon sometimes works with TSLA. It's risky betting against TSLA and risky betting on it too.

I normallybstay away from TSLA options.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 06:02:30'] From an anecdotal perspective, i was all in on buying a Tesla Truck and Starlink. Now after seeing more than enough of Elon's true nature, nah, i'm good. I can get an electric elsewhere, internet too.  I'm sure a lot of people feel how i do. Elon built his brand as a highest level intellect pushing us into space, but ruined it with Twitter, which has shown him to be an anti intellectual scale tipper, manipulator, and mud slinger.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 06:24:45'] Working their way toward their intrinsic value as an auto manufacturer since Elon is too busy playing with his new toy to parade about telling everyone Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company. They haven‚Äôt found bottom yet, but when they do, I think they‚Äôll be a stable long term investment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 07:20:17'] Ignoring Elon, China is in deep shit right now and that's a huge chunk of Tesla's sales. People are protesting the CCP and they are building quarantine camps that will hold tens of thousands. You think people in a government camp are buying cars? They are literally going to imprison entire cities.TSLA has already peaked, it's downhill from here. Ford already sells an electric truck (and people like it). Luxury brands are coming out with electric sedans left and right. Competition will continue to increase. I wouldn't want to own TSLA but I also wouldn't make stupid short term bets against it because the fanboys can move it 10% in either direction based on a 2 AM tweet from their Edgelord.

Range is awful for pretty much every EV semi except for the TSLA. There are two *real* competitors that come close, the FL claims 250mi and the Volvo claims 275mi. TSLA is expecting 300-500mi. and that's ignoring the fact that TSLA's autopilot game is **way** ahead of the competition. when full self-driving is allowable, TSLA is really going to take off. they *basically* already have the capability, they are just fine-tuning it. everyone else is *just starting* to develop the capability.

I have listened to there bs over the years and for some apparent reason they use scare tactics to manipulate the stock price always in favor for the big institutional investors. lets take tesla right now, there excuse is Musk bought Twitter, so he didnt shut down tesla, they are on track this quarter for historic deliveries, got deal done with south korea, cybertruck coming out, so in essence thereis no reason for tesla to be down except for manipulation practices by investment banks. Bottomline is Musk could be sitting in his tesla office everyday they would come up with something else

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 10:42:09'] Yever notice those two types of people? The people that don't know dick about eletric cars, or really anything vaugly related to the angry pixies in the wall that make electrics all around them chooch. They have no idea how Tesla builds value in the company or what it's long term goals are, or whats been done already. Those are usually the two legged dollar menu of a human that you will find talking about what junk Teslas are and how elon fans are so dumb that the only reason they can mark them up so high is because people will buy at any price from him.Then on the other side, you'll find the group of individuals that are capable of both breathing, using only thier nose and reading without moving thier mouth. All this while either knowing something about the company and being able to speak on it or not knowing and not caring to, and so, not sharing an uninformed, ignorent opinion.  Also, just as a side note as I wrap up. If you think Tesla is just an eletric car company, and your on here telling people "you've done the research". Look around for the nearest moving vehicle and stand in front of it. üòò

Use the small bull run to play puts, and when Tesla drops 20 bucks, play the calls.  It's worked for me.

Elon eats a lot of Salmon and this could effect is willingness to do another merger. Salmon oil increases testosterone which could lead Elon to buy another overpriced tech company. It could also lead to him running for president which would make the market rally around 15-20 precent. He‚Äôd most likely lower interest rates back to zero because yolo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 18:56:38'] Hey you guys, the dashed pink line is the current price. The curved pink line is the 200 Week Moving Average. For me personally I‚Äôd like to use a set of 3 moving averages with different time frames. But hey this guy apparently only needs the 200MA. Pretty simple TA of you ask me. No need for the chopsticks, that‚Äôs not showing us much. But one could draw a head and shoulders on that chart which would imply that this this is gonna go quite a bit lower from here.

With these big losses, some broker in a brokerage house is going to have to present the losses to the management. Those with large negative growth for the past 3 quarters are going to start being laid off in December.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 16:15:30'] TSLA is finally facing the competitive threats it has long missed out on as the big guys finally cannon ball into the deep end with their EV lineups, it has more room to the downside, while NVDA is more expensive on this chosen metric it is more nimble as it‚Äôs chips can go into many directions, you can‚Äôt do the same with an automobile‚Ä¶they both are pricey no question

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 14:14:25'] Never thought I would type something like thisTesla. Their balance sheet is much better even if they have a growth rate of zero. Lower PE makes it an easy call.Wouldn't buy either. FWIW I sold my Tesla put yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 15:04:44'] How about neither?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 15:35:13'] Neither as I think both of them lost their "monopoly". Tesla has far too many other companies competing in the electric car market, and Nvidia might have a problem with AMD's new cards.If I had to buy, and use my brain, then both and dollar cost average in.If I had to buy like a community member, flip a coin and full leverage.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 19:00:36'] Let Tesla shake out a bit more and then buy.   It should be at a PE Ratio of like 25.Nvidia is on borrowed time with the Intel and AMD integrated graphics getting as good as they are.  Even the Xbox Series X and PS5 use APUS as a window in to the future so in 10 years Nvidia will have data center and the ultra high end.  None of the mid and low end consumer GPU segment. They don't have an x64/x86 license.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 13:24:47'] As a tesla owner.... the stock price is still overvalued for the quality of cars.  When service centers have to run 24/7 fixing NEWcars, think about shorting your stock to compensate for those losses.

POST_TEXT: b"I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.\n\nTesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.\n\n(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )\n\nWhat really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Her"

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 05:49:34'] You mention Elon going insane, but you didn‚Äôt mention the damage his mouth can do with the Chinese communist party. 3 days ago Elon twitted about the virus coming from a lab in Wuhan. Not long after an editorial in China was released in the news reminding Elon not to bite the hand that feeds it. Something like half of Tesla‚Äôs profits come from China. The CCP has made an example of several of their tech billionaires who have crossed the line with their big mouth. They won‚Äôt hesitate with Elon should he keeps his big mouth open.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 06:53:10'] Don't make to much sense for this sub. Tesla is the apple of this decade except it'll have a market cap of 4T minimum by 2030. You literally just have to buy and hold. It's easy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 20:13:54'] They have high margins because of China. They make no money in the US. In 2021, they reported $5B in profits while losing $130M in the US. If foreign governments start subsidizing their native manufacturers like the US does Tesla, Tesla's ambitions will go up in smoke, like a bong on 4/20.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 04:03:51'] There is no short term bad news to make it crash now. Their results were strong even in the midst of what institutional investors claimed was weak demand and distractions from Twitter. IMHO Tesla will have a great year. Lots of hype available for retail and institutional trader demand: Cybertruck, energy storage, new vehicle platform, and semi. Any one of those could move it significantly. If all happen there is no reason internally for a drop. Macro will be the bad actor.

POST_TEXT: b'We got the Tesla earnings and Papa Elon cult is back at it with their "bers r fuk" posts. \n\n\nI know we\'re all regarded here but just try looking into TSLA\'s actual Q4 earnings package. \n\n\nFirstly it tells you everything you need to know about Tesla the company. It\'s all about marketing. That\'s the only thing Elon is good at... well mostly. \n\n\nNumbers that matter are at the very end of the report after 8 pages of photos for you crayon eating monkeys. \n\n\nTESLA IS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER! Even in their comparison charts that\'s what they compare themselves to. But what they don\'t compare is apples to apples. Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. \n\n\nWith lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. \n\n\n'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 16:40:49'] This just reads like a lot of personal animus, either of Elon musk or those who are fans of his.They beat revenue and eps. They are growing revenue at a silly rate, call it 2-3x any auto manufacturer.Their margins are also 2x better than any auto manufacturer.They‚Äôve also already invested the capital into the infrastructure needed to churn out EVs, whereas the auto manufacturers have not. Not sure why you‚Äôre talking about how fast they‚Äôre burning through cash, they have tons of cash, and are growing, cant see how that‚Äôs a real concern. Likewise, just saying they should be valued at a car company multiple, despite the fundamentals states in the foregoing, it‚Äôs puzzling.So, that‚Äôs not to say I am bullish on tesla, frankly idc much and if I‚Äôm honest I‚Äôd like the shares to dump bc I sold a pile of cc in other names expiring Friday, but where‚Äôs your substance here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 17:38:53'] Tesla made 5% of their profits from energy storage in Q4. 250 million in profits and Tesla has the capacity for 5x the amount of storage as they ramp up lathrop over the next year. By Q4 2023, Tesla could be making over $1 billion per quarter in profits from energy storage. Much more since margins go up as production ramps. Saying Tesla is "just a car maker" is like saying Amazon is "just a book seller" in the 2000's.I don't think tesla should be up 5% in AHs, but Tesla continues to make investments in future growth and will come out of the current recession we are in stronger and bigger. While the competition continues to shrink and lose money this year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 17:49:58'] The "Tesla is an auto manufacturer" point doesn't really stick for me. Tesla makes autos, so sure... the statement is true. It does sell the scope of Tesla's innovations short though. It remains to be seen in terms of whether or not Tesla's innovations are over-valued in my highly regarded opinion.I think it's become easy to complain about any perceived deficiency in Tesla performance when other auto manufacturers do not have a direct comparison that can also be scrutinized at the same level. I do also believe that a fair share of that scrutiny is put on Tesla solely based on whether or not the person likes or dislikes Elon.Of course, maybe other makers will surpass Tesla at doing Tesla things... but that day isn't today. I don't see how Tesla can be written off into the eternal put abyss. For me, it's a hold right now, as I'm happy with the position that I have. Otherwise, I'd at least consider buying.

Then there‚Äôs the margins that were to be improving constantly are going down with no clear answer as to how they make it up short of scaling, which when you have to slash prices to try to spur demand which pressures the margins more, I just don‚Äôt see a path forward that justifies its current valuation let alone a path to growth.

They didn't state WHAT investment that was, but it sure as shit better not be Twitter......They also recognized $340M of revenue from FSD sales.  Since FSD uptake is very low, they won't be able to keep doing thatAnalysts also lowered consensus estimates making it easier for them to "hit".  Margin will take a bigger hit in '23 since price cuts came in during December so didn't impact most of the quarter/year.All in all, agree 100% that this is going to drop again in '23.  I'm fine with this running for a couple weeks so I can get another short position in....

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 07:59:13'] I think the opposite. The only way Tesla survives is if musk is no longer attached to it in any respect which I don't see him conceding to. He attached Tesla share price to the diseased and rotting corpse of Twitter with it's bloated loans and constant loss of advertisers. As time goes on competing legacy automakers will catch up and surpass in every respect. Musk has a brand issue in that he is poison to whatever he touches. He betrayed his main consumer in America, liberals. Conservatives don't give a shit about ev's. The quality on Tesla cars is dogshit if you look up any TikTok video.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 06:43:41'] I'm waiting for all the numbers for the sale of other comparable  priced cars, but I suspect the current trend will not be only contained to Tesla. Amazon down 60%, Ford down 45% and Tesla is a growth and mainly car company for now. 9% on car loans, crap economy everywhere, add all the Elon shit to it...Stil solid for me. Mid to short term I can see it even drop to 50$. But your guess is as good as mine. Long term I still see massive upside.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 07:55:22'] The problem with the bull thesis is that earnings rely on high prices. All car prices have been inflated, and since Tesla has no dealers that upshot went all to them. As prices keep falling we don't know where their real profitability will land.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:29:06'] Okay - now only risk 2% per trade.  That‚Äôs $2K YOLOs on $100k.  If you turned $2K into $100K then there‚Äôs no reason to risk more than 2% unless you want to lose it all.   If you lose 10% of your $100K then stop because you do not have an edge and just got lucky. If you want to start up again then risk only $500 per trade.  If you lose $5,000 then stop again.If you want to start up again then risk only $250 per trade.  If you lose $2,500 then stop again.Basically, cut your risk per trade down if you keep losing.  This is coming from someone who has been trading for 15+ years with 9 years of consistent yearly profits.

(TLDR at bottom for the illiterate/lazy)Positions: 0 DTE TSLA Puts on last Friday at strike prices of $217.50p and $207.50p. 2k turned to 75k Friday afternoon This morning I decided to be semi-responsible and withdrew $40,000 and then proceeded to hammer 0DTE Spy $378c a bit too early at 10:30am. Doubled down at 11:40am, saw I was -9k about 20 minutes later as SPY broke below $376 so tripled down for a total of 390 contracts. About an hour later SPY rocketed and sold all contracts for a $35,000 profit. Unfortunately bought SAVA weeklies at the top and holding strong on DWAC. Anything is possible fellow gamblers. GodspeedTLDR: Bought 0DTE TSLA $217.50p and $207.5p last Friday when trading at $222 and sold at $203 Friday afternoon for 75k profit.Bought 390 SPY $378c today and sold for 35k profitHolding LYFT Puts/Calls, DWAC calls, and SAVA calls.

Why is data important you might ask?? Take a good fkn look at chatGPT that is based on smart programming and a crap ton of data.  To make an AI that good or as good as we need it for governments to pass full self driving you need an AI that has been trained on a crap ton of edge cases.  Tsla will be first.  I will bet everything I own on that.  Question is how long will it take.  But, all they need is one country to approve the rest will fall into place like dominos.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:05:47'] The way I‚Äôve always looked at it is like this. You compare Ford and GM because they are the same. They have similar margins, similar debt, similar mission, and so on. Then there is tesla, they are an outlier in all cases. They make more money, have less debt, and operate differently. I also think they are a car company, because most of their revenue comes from car sales. But it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare it to legacy, because they are different in almost every way other than they all sell cars. Tesla also sells energy storage, which has been ramping extremely fast. And sees no signs of slowing down through the recession, unlike car sales. Tesla also has advantages in this upcoming price war, while legacy is fighting to become profitable Tesla will be able to set (relatively) whatever price they want and still make money. More than legacy does on their ice sales.. So in the near term, Teslas valuation may due for some downward pressure if prices need to keep dropping. But longterm there‚Äôs a maturing EV business and a high growth higher margin energy business ramping. And there‚Äôs a slim chance legacy performs better than tesla over then next few years, higher chance that legacy slips more and tesla picks up the slack.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:58:37'] > Unfortunately, the main source of Tesla‚Äôs revenue remains automobile sales, and there‚Äôs no signs this will change anytime soonThis is what happens when you don't know shit about the company you are making a 'DD' on, and all you do it look at one page of numbers from google. I don't know how the fuck you talk about whether or not Tesla is a car company, and don't bring up **Tesla Energy**, which is scaling **faster than the car business**, has **higher margins**, and is **easier to scale**, and faces **little to no competition** now and in the foreseeable future. Even if you fully ignore FSD and robotaxi and teslabot - Tesla Energy alone makes Tesla not a car company. This discussion will be completely dead by the end of next year when Tesla makes $8b+ from Tesla energy in 2024.

POST_TEXT: b"Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.\n\nFrom two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billio"

Most people aren‚Äôt comfortable buying their cars by texting and ordering site unseen. Full disclosure I have two 2018 Teslas a model X in a Model S with both of them having about 50,000 miles on them. They are great cars but I just rented a brand new Toyota Avalon in San Diego last weekend and the self driving experience was superior. Not a herky-jerky slamming on the brakes and tearing off into different lands experience. Elon needs to stop playing with his social media purchase and get new product into the marketplace. There are lots of fun EV alternatives coming out of the market. I know and 80-year-old man who put a deposit down on the pick up truck when it first came out. I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôll still be around by the time they get the pick up truck to market. To me it‚Äôs looking just like another example of someone that gets super successful and thinks it‚Äôs because they were a genius and no one else can measure up to them. Big mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 21:10:25'] Lol what. You realize precovid tsla only hit the lvl it's currently trading at 1x then promptly plummeted 30%. I'm so sick of this its a tech company argument. Really? OK then let's look at it as a tech company. It's main product would be fsd which has been in beta for its whole existence, has lost multiple lawsuits around the world and can't even be advertised as fsd in places in Europe due to it not being a working product. Every new product post last car variants that came out precovid, have been delayed and not released or canceled. So rn as a tech company it hasn't even delivered a complete product. Lastly, the burn rate on these factories is no joke and the fact the Chinese have begun snubbing tsla for Home grown EVs(byd,Xi, etc) means there's less demand from one of its main buyers. So now you have a situation where you have excess factory capacity because you just spent shit tons of money to build factories without appropriate demand to back up the increased production. Tsla is a fucking car company and do you really think more tsla buyers just gonna keep popping up giving them exponential yoy customer base growth rate? How? Why would someone buy a tesla now when something from Honda costs much less, or stuff from China cost less and have 20+ year warranties and way nicer/less sparse interiors and additional accessories. It blows my fucking mind that ppl really think tesla is worth the value it's currently trading at and even moreso that ppl think it should be trading at 2x+ its current value. You are a fool if you believe this or just a elon Stan. No metrics have supported even current price levels for the last 2 years. The fed created this with their bazooka money cannons and interest free money Era is fucking over.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 21:34:21'] Tesla is not a tech stock.  They are no different to any other car manufacturer.   The advantage they have is that they have a great name in the EV market and may enjoy a decent market position in EVs in the future.  They deserve a premium but not as much as they have/had.  Tesla will come against some serious headwinds in the future not least of all will be lack of natural resources that will speed limit the industry.     Lack of raw materials will really even out the playing field.   I don‚Äôt think anyone has looked at this issue and everyone thinks the lithium, graphite and rare minerals will just be available when needed.  I live in an area that are rich in these (Western Australia) and I can assure you everything is being thrown at increasing supply but I don‚Äôt think supply will match demand any time soon.

Tesla can't rely on his remaining fans to fill the gap for in the short term. Legacy companies will get stuff figured out and build better cars. Tesla will be an also ran many years from now.BrandYou guys need to understand brand. Damage the brand and it can take a long time to recover, if it can. He done went and messed the brand. For right now, not in 5 years or 10, but right now, what kind of person has bought an EV. Up to now I suppose the EV market has been made up of those who think they are helping the environment, some status symbol buyers, and some are Elon cultists. Elon has made his best effort to alienate many of the enviro crowd, who tend to swing left. So if you alienate those, you also alienate a good portion of the status symbol buyers, bc the damage done to the brand takes away the status part of the status symbol. Brand.So we are left with your remaining Elon cultists and right wingers who want to own the libs. But most of the people I know here in Tennessee who want to own the libs think climate change is a hoax. Most of the time I go to the local Walmarts where there are charges, there are usually ICE pickup trucks parked in the spots, every time. And until the Twitter purchase, Elon had the quirky genius that left leaning types love. Right wingers don't like Elon because of his cars. They like that he has owned the libs so hard since he bought Twitter.But back to the cars. Never been in a Tesla, but I here so much about the poor quality. The legacy companies will get the EV thing figured out, and will build better cars. Why? Because they build cars. Nothing else.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 15:04:18'] Bouncing off the 1D:1YR lower deviation on the short side. So maybe but I don't f\*\*\* with TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 16:03:15'] Yes, also, no. This is not financial advice
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 17:42:58'] Definitely a green light. Heavily market companies are always a good buy. On the other hand the little guys in the EV market will go up as papa Tsla go up. If the big guys don‚Äôt control pricing all three would be way higher than.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 18:16:42'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 19:13:25'] My prediction...Tesla will spin off all the "It's not just a car company" stuff from the car part of the company,  bc competion will kill their profits from car sales. Legacy car companies will get things together and build more attractive cars with comparable range and speed, with much better interior experience at comparable prices. The holy p/e will end up just like the legacies.And he and Cathie Wood will tell you the energy side has a potential market of $26.56 trillion dollars and the stock price will shoot to $3000 with a market cap of $3 trillion, and a p/e of 1100. Because it is a tech company and not a car company anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 19:39:43'] No
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 21:32:36'] What if TSLA is NOT a tech company but actually scar company. Many other companies are producing EVs that rival TSLA. I think TSLA is a regular car company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 00:34:25'] My opinion is that TSLA isn't going to recover because Elon has got into politics and now isn't perceived the same as he was in prior years.  He was nearly perceived as superman before he got into politics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 01:11:59'] There‚Äôs a lot of downward pressure right now on Tesla. Lots of competition it didn‚Äôt have 2 years ago, higher interest loans, huge amounts of defaults on loans (people can‚Äôt pay off their cars), and many people dumping their Tesla‚Äôs in the used market. Also, the Elon fan boy train died down after people realized he‚Äôs not the genius everyone thought he was by buying Twitter which turned out to be the worse business move in his career. He‚Äôs also alienated a lot of people by getting political and becoming a conservative. Tesla as a company isn‚Äôt doing much either. Their tech is no longer ‚Äúcutting edge‚Äù, no new features, delay in the self driving mode for 3+ years, delay in the cybertruck and roadster for 3+ years. Also, no more crazy waitlists. Also, people are complaining about the poor QC. As funny as it sounds, Tesla can‚Äôt keep up with the competition anymore the way they used to in 2018 - 2021. No, in my opinion the stock still has a way to go down and there isn‚Äôt really anything positive that will drive the stock up. I‚Äôd keep it on my watch list until Q2 - Q3 of this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 01:31:31'] If everything you described is correct, Tesla is pretty fairly priced. If all the counter arguments are right that it‚Äôs not a tech stock, margins and demand are slipping. Than it‚Äôs overvalued.So buying is a low percentage play.Only reason to play Tesla is because volume is huge and potential for day trades.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 02:44:42'] No. It's a car company. Tesla's products, sales model, innovation cycles and mode of operation are no longer that different or overachieving compared to the competition.50$ is not an unreasonable price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 06:59:59'] Elon seems to be intent on  burnishing his right wing/ libertarian credentials. Neither of these groups are huge tsla buyers and from what I've been reading this price cut really has people fucked up. If this sentiment picks up steam that can be real bad for the price long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 07:45:17'] Only if you mean buying puts / TSLQ
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 09:23:44'] When you look at markets outside the US, competitors come in and Tesla share plummets, they discount to counter. That same thing will happen rapidly in the US. What % of all Tesla sales is the US? Margins won't be as high, the growth opportunity isn't as large as people think, their product pipeline isn't that good, the backlog, their capacity is outstripping demand, and so long as Elon is still CEO the brand takes a hit, the stock takes a hit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 09:36:23'] It's a game, the oil giants are playing with the ev hype. I wouldn't buy TSLA at a P/E above 20. Too damn risky.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 09:51:25'] Sounds like you answered your own question ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 14:05:58'] This is by far the most regarded post about Tesla. Tesla is overinflated for what it can do and their ceo has proven himself to be inept‚Ä¶ by himself acquiring Twitter. Musk should have kept his mouth shut and stopped trying to flex his blowflated Tesla stock. Gonna say it now, call that shit because demand has dropped like an ape jumping out of a 20 story building. There‚Äôs a reason they dropped price of their lower models by 30%. They‚Äôre going to keep dropping price until the stock settles or they go bankrupt and get acquired by the big three.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 14:24:00'] If TSLA is a tech company then they have no revenues and earnings to apply this P/E multiple. Therefore its way overpriced. The companies you mention have revenue and earnings
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 15:45:15'] All the things that were true two years ago are still true
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 18:25:01'] Absolutely
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 20:07:10'] So, bunch of things.1. It‚Äôs a car company who‚Äôs owner admits factories ‚Äòburn money‚Äô. They don‚Äôt design new cars, they fail to actually produce several of the promised models. Features that were promised years ago are still Vaporware.2. It‚Äôs an electric car company who‚Äôs CEO has just spent 44 billion dollars on the most effective anti-advertising campaign in human history. Tesla went from being the default choice, to being the last choice in a sector they are quickly getting overtaken by the majors. There are drastically more choices now, and they won‚Äôt call you a libtard for being vaccinated.3. It‚Äôs a car company that has been building the same limited number of models for almost a decade and they‚Äôre still not cheap‚Ä¶ the ENTIRE premise of them not releasing new models was to keep manufacturing costs down and let the economy of scale reduce prices. Their current cheapest option is 45k‚Ä¶. If the economy turns back around, this will probably have been a good time to buy, but there‚Äôs ZERO question in my mind that the company is DRASTICALLY over valued and begging to be more than halved again.

It's mentioned that France has launched a money laundering investigation against Binance, and the platform seems to have left the Netherlands‚Äã1‚Äã.Microsoft or Nvidia: A user is considering whether to place out-of-the-money (OTM) calls on Microsoft or Nvidia, suggesting these are popular stock options among the community‚Äã1‚Äã.Biden and red days: There's a comment about President Biden declaring an end to "red days" (days when the stock market goes down)‚Äã1‚Äã.Spotify: A user predicts a downturn for Spotify because the service is not working on their computer. This comment seems more humorous than serious, but it does show how personal experiences can influence trading decisions in this community‚Äã1‚Äã.Market trend: A user has commented on the market going up by 10% in one day and people experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)‚Äã1‚Äã.SQQQ: There's a discussion about the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ), with one user considering buying and holding it, despite others apparently having been "burned" by it in the past‚Äã1‚Äã.Federal Reserve ("Fed"): There's a comment about the Federal Reserve possibly bluffing about hikes being over, with a prediction that the market will go up significantly‚Äã1‚Äã.Palantir Technologies (PLTR): A quote from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, is mentioned. The quote refers to an increase in interest in the company‚Äã1‚Äã.The common phrases and topics in this thread seem to revolve around specific stocks (Microsoft, Nvidia, Spotify, Palantir), ETFs (SQQQ), trading strategies (OTM calls, buy and hold), and current events affecting the market (Binance's situation, Federal Reserve's actions, market trends).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 05:04:53'] I don't get the hate for Tesla here. It was very interesting to see, tech wise. Sure, BD is the baseline, but Tesla can leverage mass production, FSD tech for robot navigation and actually make something useful here.I don't think the hardware is the challenge (for Tesla), and Tesla is well positioned to solve the software. Besides, a factory is a much more controlled environment then the chaos of road traffic. I believe this is easier than solving FSD.This was made in such a short term, I would wait a year more before discarding Tesla as a competitor.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 00:03:17'] This is like comparing a remote control car to an autonomous taxi. Except the remote control car costs ten times more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 12:54:17'] Honestly though, I welcome competing robot manufacturers, because ideally it's not just one company controlling the revolution button, but Tesla seems pretty far behind BD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 13:16:11'] BD has been legit for some time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 20:11:45'] It‚Äôs Boston dynamics related to general dynamics?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 21:10:23'] BD has some cool robots and neat videos, but Elon Musk sells cars and rocket ships and created a company that made him the richest man on earth.How‚Äôs BD doing on sales? Is their product revolutionizing it‚Äôs niche like Tesla cars and SpaceX rockets have?No? Why aren‚Äôt these things disrupting the labor market?Well, based on track record alone I‚Äôd put my money on Musk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 23:55:15'] Him displaying those robots as some kind of success is laughable when we‚Äôve all seen how advanced these are, those things are nowhere close to effectively walk through doors much less act as a ‚Äúrobot maid‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 02:22:06'] Finally my apple calls will print. RIP Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 23:20:09'] Ahhh, another regard was bamboozled by Musk.What a waste of a post
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 17:30:26'] >I think Elon is making a big mistake by going to war with Apple. The risk involved in creating his own platform and the cost of fighting this battle will be very costly for Tesla stockholders, who are already taking on huge risks investing into TSLA. It would be better if he found an amicable solution rather than engaging in a public feud that could hurt everyone's bottom line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 17:38:59'] I completely agree. Though days like today throw me for a loop..the market was red EXCEPT Tesla the decide to be green. I wonder if I missed some news or maybe it's shorts closing for prophet and getting a good position before the big fall ü§î
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 22:08:54'] No one really cares about Twitter except for the people who were already on Twitter. Plenty of other social media platforms available. I say put it all on MySpace and let‚Äôs get Tom back in there to run things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 19:35:03'] Remind me, just how much Twitter has to pay in interest every year after this went down?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 18:40:23'] People and families lost alot of livelihood from the former twitter that decided to play Johnny Law on free speech. It genuinely hurt people to do that.I hope everyone involved in that is fired. They were messing with people's livelihood because of disagreements in values. You cant claim to be a public domain and then silence only certain views. Time to reap what you sow. The other side apparently has a voice too, and now it's being heard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 19:30:20'] Elon will burn Tesla down with Twitter imo
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 17:44:20'] Apple prefers government censorship just like china!  Leftist shitbags have a hard time with truth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 18:21:00'] Well it will take a visionary executioner like Musk to do it. A good housecleaning was in order. Time will tell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 21:19:36'] So I gather that because the MSM is bashing Musk out of fear of being revealed as agents of the deep state, this AAPL enthusiast crowd  thinks they know better than Elon yet are piss broke and work at Wendy's.I can't wait to get the MuskPhone and shitcan this Android.

POST_TEXT: b"What's in store for Monday, Jan 2 when deliveries are announced and will we see pretty significant +/- momentum leading up to Jan 25 earnings?\n\nQ4 deliveries are estimated to be 429,000, but with the China giga shut-down, are we expecting a big miss or will general demand and the Berlin and Austin giga ramp-up help with a beat? Even if they meet target, that would still be up 43% or so from 2021. Growth and demand is expected to slow in 2023,  without a doubt, but I believe the $7500 discount was to drive some sales before year-end in anticipation of the $7500 EV tax credit available next year, rather than a severe plunge in demand.\n\nDuring the Q3 earnings call, Musk expects an epic and record-breaking Q4. Is this as believable as Musk not selling any more shares \n\nI am not good at reading tea-leaves and drawing magical lines like many others. But it seems there could be a massive run up or draw down in the coming weeks, even if it is short-term.\n\nCalls or puts?"

Seems sus. Very soon after the stock started dropping in the pre market, which later the article was debunked by Tesla and reported again by Reuters. \n\nAnother possibility is Elon selling, which just happened to seem like a sell off on the bad news which I find possible because 6% drop on news that was later debunked seems like a lot. \n\nEither way, huge overreaction from the market today (unless is was Musk).

The report was later debunked, but the stock had already dropped.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 15:49:47'] $RIVN, $LCID, and $PSNY all dropped quite significantly today, not just $TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-06 13:30:50'] It‚Äôs not an overreaction when the market has been waiting for a reason to dump. Still over overvalued beyond belief.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 16:22:30'] Do you honestly think the entire market going down was over some so called fake Tesla news?  The beta on Tesla is 1.9 so it's gonna swing more than S&P on average.  The drop has nothing to do with this news, this is what can be expected with a bear market and a crazy Musk driving.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 14:52:55'] >The sell-off today was definitely overblown. The news about production cuts at the Shanghai plant turned out to be false, so there was no reason for the stock to drop as much as it did. I suspect that some investors may have been selling on the news, regardless of its accuracy, in order to cash in on the panic. Overall, I think this was a case of market overreaction and Tesla's stock will rebound soon enough.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 02:24:49'] Awesome idea, I always put 10$ on each, black and red
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 04:01:13'] IMO, It‚Äôs a valid strategy if the right conditions exist. I have not done the research on TSLA, but straddles and strangles can be very profitable. They require a lot of up front analysis and active management of the trade. Also, my experience has been that the first move can be a fake out, so you can easily wind up selling the side that will actually be profitable and eventually lose on both. You can always paper trade the strategy to see how it goes and get a feel for the challenges and potential rewards. Good luck!UPDATE: For disclosure, I hold a very small (0.22% of portfolio) 2/17/23 vertical short on TSLA.  I took the position based on my Bollinger Band strategy and nothing to do with the upcoming earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:20:40'] Read up on #ivcrush
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:27:41'] Terrible idea unless you are selling pre earnings.  I've made some pretty consistent gains selling tsla strangles the day before earnings and buying them back at 1/4 the price the day after, but you need to make sure you manage the risk somehow (e.g. covered calls / cash secured puts).  The volatility crush is real post earnings, especially for tessie.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 04:11:00'] As others have pointed out, this is called a straddle - which might work under certain circumstances.TSLA, however, is a stock with high historic and expected volatility baked into the pricing of options - so it's likely that the loss in one side will more than outweigh the profit on the other.Wealth warning: I'm just a harmless private investor and this is NO investment advice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:31:58'] This is a valid trade usually done as a straddle where you buy both right at the money. The gotchya is that the move has to be absolutely massive, well over the expected move, in order to make a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 05:53:44'] Play an iron condor about $20 above and below, collect the premiums.  Not full proof but they have worked out nicely for me with Netflix and SPY before fed announcements.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:35:56'] To me Tesla is a bullish medium to long term buy. They are 10 times more profitable per unit than Toyota and Ev sales are now like 30% of all car sales, and soon enough that'll be like 60%. Their semis are now shipping and the pickup truck is around the corner.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:36:34'] If you allow enough time on the options, buy close to itm, and with enough volatility you can cash in on both.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 00:14:55'] >It's definitely a terrible idea. The stock market is incredibly volatile and you could easily lose all of your money if you're not careful. Even if the stock does well in the short-term, it could quickly crash and leave you with nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 01:29:42'] Did you think price is going down, sell your calls. Then, price spike up, sell your puts. Congratulations you're both fuck in every hole!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 05:46:24'] It's not a terrible idea, but you better use *tight-stop losses* on both. And again, I cannot stress this enough, stop losses. Use them. No one does anymore, and it fucking baffles me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 07:00:02'] This is called a strangle (or straddle if you pick different strike prices), and it's a really bad idea if IV is high. Since IV on TSLA is around 100, it's a bad idea.  Look up IV crush.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 12:22:44'] I think you need to read more about options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 13:12:31'] Personally I don‚Äôt like straddling, I‚Äôm classic WSB all in or not, but I think where people burn themselves on straddling is that they buy both calls and puts at the same time, which in my opinion is just stupid. Monday of last week was the time to buy calls for the earnings, today is likely the day to buy puts. Buy cheap assets and sell them at a reasonable price, don‚Äôt buy competing assets regardless of the current price to try to win either way, things like IV can turn that plan into a disaster real quick.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 15:34:05'] there is a way. I do not want to confess.different for everyone.it is called a strangle. there is a subreddit that is helpful too.. related to options.my latest move was buying it at 3912 on the ES index (the last dip)... forced to paper trade for being wiped out.anyway. seems a norm for WSB to be wiped out and paper handed.I look for 30 delta both sides... mid price in a  respectable range between bid and ask. (time value or true value as i call it)I went with a 3970 call3875 put.cost $34 total. Small bet.the call alone went to 90 (roughly 500 us dollars).the put nearly buried, was so over ruled.. and paid for...it is safe to leave for the other half of the gamble until  expiry.that is a successful strangle.. you can get hung real bad with volatility, being too far out..or not enough movement leaving you in decay. That is just playing for fun then.to determine a need for strangle.. the call and put volume should both be large, the graph in a noted high or low... this nearly gaurantees a big pop one way or the other...you can also lopside the strangle to favor put or call. Up to you and your DD.&#x200B;I get too emotional at Tesla.. I'd be all puts even as it climbed to the fake moon.Have fun with it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 15:38:46'] That‚Äôs how I played. Bought a put $160 and a call $280. Sold the call $450 today, puts went down $70

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 11:21:08'] Elon promised he will never let his investors down, wonder what that plan might be! Here‚Äôs one to save us investors for a starter. You‚Äôve done enough, time to let go. Get off running day to day operations of your companies, give up being ceo or whatever chief titles you like to call yourself. Hire best subject matter experts to be the next CEO‚Äôs of your companies, give them free hand to make best decisions to maximize shareholder values, without your interference. Become a chairman or whatever that suits your ego, stop tweeting and enjoy your billions on your personal ocean liner. That will save us all remaining humanity on the planet, that‚Äôs counting on positive outcomes from companies you started.

POST_TEXT: b'With $TSLA earnings coming up, and the recent rally, I want to warn all you fellow cup-and-sniff investors who are planning to short Tesla:\n\n1. If youve seen the current rally, youll understand how quick it is for $TSLA to go from $100 to $135 within a short period. This is just the beginning \n\n2. Earnings are coming up and $TSLA demand is skyrocketing lately. This means earnings will do incredible and the price action you just saw recently will be multiplied (think 150)\n\n3. Elon Musk is slowly gaining back the trust of institutions and people, and is getting ready to have Twitter appointed a new CEO which will let him be focused entirely on Tesla, this means the stock has bottomed and will probably be rebounding HARD  back to 180-200+ in the next month\n\nGet ready for blast off '

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 14:00:39'] I see you‚Äôre testing sentiment on TSLA. I‚Äôll save you some time. If you posted both these posts a year ago, this one would be top post on wsb (any positive post was) now it‚Äôll be downvotes and hated.Your negative post is doing pretty well, and most people agree/ are very bearish on TSLA in relation to the general market. If you posted that one 12 months ago, it would be downvotes and hate. Do what you will with that. I‚Äôd love to hear your findings after seeing the sentiment on these posts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 16:36:08'] Tesla demand is ‚Äúskyrocketing‚Äù because they lowered prices because they don‚Äôt have a backlog of orders to fill.  That means demand dropped and they fixed it by lowering profit margins.Whatever you believe that just isn‚Äôt bullish.  At least for any thinking person.Elon pissed off a lot of people by having political  views.  If you choose one party and are open about it, you alienate half the country. It will go below $100.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 16:02:13'] I support this message
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 13:41:43'] >1. I'm not worried about Tesla's earnings at all. The company is doing extremely well and the stock price reflects that.2. I think the recent rally is just a taste of what's to come. Tesla is on an upward trajectory and there's no stopping it now.3. Elon Musk is a genius and he has the full support of institutions and people alike. This means that Tesla will continue to grow exponentially in the coming months, making those who shorted it look foolish in hindsight
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 13:54:45'] Tesla's earnings will be terrible as long as they keep the lower prices in effect. Let's assume the average price cut per car is $7500 globally. Based on 2022 sales of 1.3M vehicles, that is a loss of 9.75B in revenue. That would wipe out 75% of their profit from 2022. Unless their costs have dramatically dropped, their earnings will look like garbage. Add in global recession, higher interest rates, and strong competition, things aren't looking good for Tesla in 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 15:22:59'] People thought TSLA could corner the market a year ago. Now there is plenty of competition and only the model 6 and 3 have really been succesful, but nowhere near a monopoly. It is about time to judge TSLA like we judge other car companies. If we do that fair value is more toward 50-60$

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 22:27:05'] I studied the stock market in college. My professor told me that if you want to make real money then you have to critically think about every option. He said that your brain is the most valuable tool. The stock market is kinda like a metronome. It swings back and forth on its appraisals of things. A true companies worth comes from their innovation and not the ‚Äúnews‚Äù. Remember guys the stock market really is something to admire sometimes (These charts, options, cool colors). We really shouldn‚Äôt take it for granted. Life is a one time thing. Walk up to that girl and just kiss her, spend your last $20 on a lunch with your father even tho he beat you when you were younger, tell your cousin you went thru her phone and saw all her nudes. Live for the moment. Goodluck tomorrow guys. I love y‚Äôall.

He sold at the June 2018 top, sold again at the June 2019 bottom (must‚Äôve panic sold since it was down 50%), sold again at the December 2021 top, and now is selling here‚Ä¶Funny enough the guy had 11.7 million shares at one point but sold down to 3 million all while NVDA traded in the single digits LOL. He now ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 800k remaining. Obviously easy to laugh in hindsight and he‚Äôs still super rich so I‚Äôm sure he sleeps just fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 04:59:30'] My perspective :\- Battery technology in car is not new anymore, other manufacture are catching up\- Maybe on autonomous driving, they are leading.\- IMO  owner's behavior is unpredictable & not reliable , so I would stay away.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 18:54:12'] Don't like the analysis. To much emphasis on legacy auto makers advantages in the EV space when it is obviously the opposite. See Bolt battey recall of Mach EV connector issue.Your analysis is the classic EV ramp ups are super hard so Tesla has a rough road ahead but legacy auto maker EVs are ramping up so look out! Stupid. They will fail, just site your own DD on Tesla difficulties except Tesla doesnt have to cannibalize their core business while taking on massive debt. Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 19:21:12'] I've been thinking about this stock way too much so really appreciate you putting this out there. Based on a few other DCFs I've seen from unbiased analysts, this makes sense. They had $130 but that was before the consensus growth dropped.> Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is...This is the most important assumption. I think with the recent price drops, we should expect this growth to go down more, but no one knows by how much.I believe 24.4% is too high but if they execute perfectly, they can achieve it. But it's really difficult and few companies are capable of pulling it off.> Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.I think this strength is mostly gone. Their product roadmap includes the Model 2, Cybertruck, Semi, and full FSD. These have been on the radar for awhile and there are other companies beating them to the punch in each of these markets. BYD is beating them in battery tech as well. Looking at their R&D spend compared to other companies, this isn't a surprise.> Manufacturing ComplicationsI actually think manufacturing is a strength. They've shown to be incredibly nimble during the chip shortage. They also managed to keep costs under control. Compared to other companies who historically ramp up to 1M units, they did well. The QA is questionable but I don't know how bad it is. They're definitely not Toyota, but maybe still better than say VW.> Product Liability ClaimsThis is the greatest present threat to Tesla. It's why Musk started censoring the guy that put the 8 car crash video online. There's a lot more complaints and evidence collected by national agencies. NHTSA is going after their FSD Beta for public endangerment and it's going to get heated.> Market Confidence in TeslaParticularly, among retail investors, this stock is so strong, even with Musk proving to be a tool. The growth story is arguably over for now, but the Tesla cult premium puts them over the edge.I think your $85 fair value is right on and it would be around here if it was any other stock. The cult premium pretty significant.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 07:06:13'] I'm not reading all that. Not sure what most of it is.My price target was under 100 by next Fall. I made it a bit over a month ago before Tesla dropped 50%.Now my price target is less than 50$.Why? Let me count the ways.1. Russo-Ukraine War. Two thirds of worlds pig iron produced in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine production is in ruins or without power (Zaporozhye Nuclear Plant ring a bell?)2. The full Tesla thesis will require a 10x increase in Lithium production in 10 years and a doubling or more of nickel, chromium, molybdemun, and other minerals as well. Throughought human history no nation or society has been able to double production of a mainline commodity in 10 years. Now that Russia is out there is no way future production goals can be met. Add in inflation and high interest rates and it complicates this further.3. China is a wreck. Millions of new Covid cases a day. People refusing to pay mortgages because real estate developers stole their money. Riots. And Xi sitting on top of it all without any competent lieutenants because he purged everyone that might challenge him. China will be lucky to be a single country by the end of the decade. GigaChina is probably going to be a total write off. Oh, did I mention that China's population actually peaked a decade ago and there are about 100 million more males than females. Population bust means that China won't even have high consumption. Both Apple and Tesla should have left two years ago.4. GigaBerlin has some of the most expensive energy in the Western Hemisphere. It's going to cut into Tesla's margins and maybe make then unprofitable. Europe IS in recession (China too) and that means lower consumption. BASF moved its entire operations to Louisiana because without natural gas they cannot compete.5. Musk bought Twitter and pissed off all the Libs who are Tesla's best customers. They'll be more receptive to the truth. Tesla's cars are not green. They require a lot of expensive materials that are all produced in high polluting and carbon intensive industries. It takes a decade or more to break even on the carbon debt of producing a Tesla. Plus, Tesla's are a luxury car. They are usually people's third vehicle. In the coming recession luxury purchases always fall.For these reasons and the shitty economic outlook it think 50$ is generous. I think its ACTUAL value is probably less than Ford. But people bought a dream that would save the climate. They won't believe it's not true for a long time. They won't want to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 04:23:40'] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z9xl8knLAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z9xl8knLAk) from 2m 55 seconds. Probably all you need to know about Tesla and its tech lead. The above is all rear view perspective. What Tesla has in the planning will I imagine blow many peoples minds. It's a bit of a leap of faith owning the stock to be honest. Also there are fewer companies on the worldwide stock exchanges than in the 90s. So fewer investment opportunities. A 'green' company such as Tesla will want to be on most portfolio managers holdings when they have their 1 to 1s with bosses, the pressure to invest green is really significant. So from USA, Germany, UK, France, Korea, Japan and Australia etc. people from around the world will want a share of few of Tesla. So that buying power in a smaller pool should give support. Plus no profit sharing dealers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 12:05:56'] So far, I can follow your analysis. There are just 2 major points which I'm missing and you need to include and evaluate. The basic questions are where is the margin coming from and how will these points develop. Put attention to Solar Roof investment and the tax incentive aka green certificates. Finally I'm sure you will lower your expectations even more.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 01:21:46'] There's no consensus.You can believe they will hold onto the EV market lead by smashing competitors, expand into other energy sectors, continue to reduce COGS, and continue innovating. 3-5 year hold with high returns.Or you can believe they've hit their demand wall and will be swallowed up by the competition, and their future product roadmap is vaporware. Stocks going to $20/share.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 04:33:56'] If it‚Äôs a car company, it should have a PE close to best in breed Toyota. Price would be 30 to 50. I am selling and buying puts around that level.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 10:40:29'] they have competetion now
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 04:17:51'] Buying aggressively, they have hardly any debt and can actually produce vehicles unlike ford plus semi , truck, future gas car bans , all the other tech they are in. Elon does need to shut up though
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 00:55:03'] I think the top is in for a few years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 05:26:21'] I feel like TSLA has a lot of levels priced into it. There‚Äôs TSLA itself which I feel is losing steam. It is setup the nicest out of any other EV player but competition is hot. There is Elon itself which was a positive for the stock but now has become a negative. He is getting political and literally shitting all over his own customers who want to buy a EV. There is also SpaceX and starlink which is the stocks biggest factor and most promising since both of those companies aren‚Äôt public and are doing great things. I was in the market for a TSLA until he went a bit nuts. My brother also bought a brand new Y and it has died on the side of the road 3 times in a year. I think the price has more room to go down before it goes up again. Everyone is expecting good numbers and with the price decrease in most models I think they will miss earnings and it will tank. But this is a casino so who knows. If big money wants it to go up it will.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 10:34:14'] The stock was way overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 17:14:17'] I had a large short position all last year. Cashed out $100k profit, reinvested $30k into longer dated puts. I expect it will drop to around $40 a share within a year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 00:46:52'] If Elon sells Twitter, publicly apologizes and gets back to full time developing new tech and cars for Tesla maybe. Otherwise I‚Äôll buy a Mercedes or even a VW. 3 years or so Tesla will be old design and old tech, they need to focus. Doug does a pretty good round up of the issues. https://youtu.be/GT-9_As6qq4
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 00:27:52'] >I think the stock is undervalued at the moment, but it all depends on how well Tesla can execute on its plans. If they can ramp up production of the Model 3 and deliver on their promises, then the stock will go back up. However, if they continue to miss deadlines and disappoint investors, then the stock will stay down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 06:45:31'] Just my thoughts, if Fusion is really go to work in 10 years, hydrogen car will be the answer to clean energy vehicle, rather than EV.  So in the long run, Tesla may worth nothing, at least its EV business

POST_TEXT: b"So while I think TSLA is massively overvalued, its cash position alone (and the fact that it does make a not insignificant amount of money) puts a floor under the shares, even in a recession.  \n\nRight now you can sell TSLA puts that are crazy far OTM, like 80-90% OTM, for a not terrible premium.  \n\nYou can get 3-5% on these. While you might say 3-5% can be had risk free from a treasury, that 3-5% could be realized much quicker if TSLA stabilizes or bounces. If TSLA gets a nice bounce, you could probably take 2-3% very quickly and close the position. If TSLA stops dropping, the premium could also quickly evaporate.  \n\nLook at it this way: You're either buying a stock you love at a price that would be like 99% lower than what you've been paying the last 24 months while you had a hard-on for it, or you just pull a few percent in premiums a lot sooner than 12 months."

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 09:17:35'] >I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. Tesla is a great company that has been severely overvalued by the market for quite some time now. However, their cash position and recent profitability give them a strong floor under their share price, even in the event of an economic recession.Selling puts on Tesla shares is a great way to make quick profits while waiting for the stock price to stabilize or rebound. You can get 3-5% premiums on these puts, which is much better than what you would get from investing in treasury bonds. Plus, if Tesla does bounce back quickly, you could take 2-3% profits very quickly and close out your position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 11:08:29'] full of dumb comments, looking at a company in MC/car produced.. lol no growth, no profit margin, no cash on hand, etc considered. that dude belongs here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 10:54:32'] Tesla is a software company.I am 90% Tesla on my portoflio. Dont' listen to me. I am super bias.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 21:14:23'] How could he have lost everything in a rising stock? Must be an idiot. Tesla's value is on how many cars it will make in the future AND the fact it has the largest margin in the industry. Every single company is losing money on each electric car sold - except Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:40:14'] Nothing to see here‚Ä¶.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 18:44:05'] That skeptic dude on YouTube has so many videos on how Elon being a knob.  It‚Äôs kind of crazy seeing what you can get people to believe when you‚Äôve got the charisma

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 11:10:22'] This doesn't acknowledge the fact that Tesla is more than a car company, also that it's a very new and rapidly growing company.Their supercharger network, self driving technology, battery technology, solar roofing and in-home power packs. IMHO, Tesla's value is far more than wheels on the ground.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 16:59:50'] So many smooth brains in WSB these days. TSLA is the only stock you need to hold to become incredibly wealthy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 11:43:54'] Yeah, and what is the net profit from a single car sale?    Tesla is only selling sedans. This fall, there are going to be at least a dozen EV cars, many crossover SUV which are in more demand than sedans. The gas engine sedan market was in steep decline before the pandemic. Tesla has lost the advantage of being the only all-electric car on the market.     TSLA is way over valued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 23:32:24'] Tesla‚Äôs factories will likely be producing cars for the next 20-30 years and it‚Äôs unlikely GM will even be around as the same entity in that time let alone using the same decrepit assembly lines they have today. To say nothing of the existing gross margin differences and their expected growth while Tesla production keeps ramping. Honestly I‚Äôm surprised the difference isn‚Äôt larger using this metric‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 10:33:16'] Away with your logical business principles. Stock market go brrrrrrr.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 18:59:11'] Let‚Äôs ignore the fact that TSLA made almost as much income in Q2 as GM and Ford combined even with selling significantly less vehicles.  Number of vehicles sold is such a bad metric.  TSLA‚Äòs stock price is based on future growth while legacy autos show year-over-year declines.  They can only blame supply chain for so long.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:40:08'] For anyone who didn‚Äôt know, Tesla also has their own insurance so factor in the revenue they get for that
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 21:27:15'] For people think it‚Äôs fair to compare Tesla to Toyota? One has 67 manufacturing plants, the other has 6. Except the latter has a blueprint for giga factories that can be built extremely quickly. It‚Äôs like people think Tesla will not keep expanding lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 13:04:00'] My guess is that the investors bet on a couple of things: - Tesla finally cracks reliable FSD.- They extract more in subscriptions to various features over the lifetime of the car than the car is worth itself. - All ICE cars will be killed by regulations in many counties and Tesla has the best position to close that gap.- They buy some big manufacturers.- Memes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 06:42:34'] That is there a long term problem. They are valued for growth that would see a value greater than the entire auto industry has ever been. Even as a monopoly they could not achieve that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 07:13:36'] Duh it‚Äôs what they do and this is what a tech company in the manufacturing space looks like. This is the kind of manufacturing coming back to the United States where all the free thinkers and engineers are. in case

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 07:37:31'] The math is just fucking wrong. 967 billion divided by 3,000,000 is 322,333. Granted it‚Äôs not great but Tesla is mainly valued at future results. They have 2 factories ramping and they just upgraded Shanghai. Next year they could make 2.5 million cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:40:49'] So you mean to tell me one Tesla sold makes them $1m.. that doesn‚Äôt even make any sense unless they are including subscriptions over the lifetime of the car which is bullshit because the car could be totaled in an accident at any point.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 22:28:25'] Don‚Äôt know if you should buy it, BUT if you look at the daily chart, today and yesterday were I think the 2 largest volume days for the entire year. And Tesla was up both days. That seems to suggest Tesla might have bottomed ‚Äúfor now‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 09:13:46'] P/E should realistically hit 7-8 range , Tesla has so much more downside risk , quality companies in auto space has P/E around 7 even if you think Tesla is innovative etc P/E of 34 is nuts too much over hype
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 08:30:13'] Yeah, buy now after it's up 8% /sTrust me, but now is not the time to buy. Don't get FOMO. Yesterday was the last day for tax loss harvesting which probably contributed to all the recent selling.

If you think tesla and elon will achieve this soon then its a very good price. if he will achieve his autonomous network in 10 years, the price is horrible.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 14:00:11'] No. It will continue to fall until the P/E is on par with other automakers. Expect it to be around $25-35 by the end of 2023. Musk's shenanigans with Twitter are certainly not helping things but realistically the ridiculous valuation could not be sustained once investors looked beyond the hype and looked at the fundamentals.The good news is that Tesla appears to be on the verge of bringing back LIDAR sensors to their vehicles which are necessary for full self-driving capability.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:37:02'] I must say i was expecting much more conviction in people on puts and peeps on calls. instead just a lotta, No fukken clue 50/50 coin flip. I was dead set on calls after the last weeks of bleeding. Just a a little good news on earnings is all it should take, But now im second guessing myself.  Maybe i should just stick with my spy puts and close my eyes until nuclear Armageddon starts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:44:44'] It's funny when tsla was still at 300 and most other companies were already bleeding a month ago, people were making posts and comments about the incredible fundamentals of tsla at 300. Now it's almost at 200 and no one here wants to buy.Edit: Bought at 205 risking 5 last week, sold at 220 today. It may go up more or down now but I don't care.

My thoughts are what if this time puts print and I miss out on a yolo lol. Another thing that is true though is Musk has to sell more shares which will take TSLA down more. Should I consider $185 puts 30 days out and $230 calls 30 days out? I think about 50 contracts for each? My logic is earnings TSLA gets a 10-12% spike then musk sells shares for Twitter purchase and price falls back down to $200 and below. Thoughts?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 07:24:48'] Good post OP, but I can quickly summarize the anti catalysts of Tesla.Basically all their profits come from Tesla Shanghai. Unfortunately, that money is trapped in China. The factory the Chinese built for Tesla came with some draconian terms. They have to pay ever increasing tax revenue per sqft, which means eventually they won't have the efficiency gains to comply. Expanding the factory also doesn't help them with this metric. They also have to invest ever increasing sums of money into the factory, meaning the profits from the factory are earmarked to expand the factory. If they fail these conditions, China is able to seize the factory and their IP.Going along with the above, the head of Tesla China, Tom Zhu, is effectively CEO of all of Tesla now in all but title. It s a clear powermove by china where they're the alpha in the relationship with all the leverage. China can tell Tesla whatever to do and effectively has a controlling interest in Tesla, even though they don't legally have one, just because the destructive risk to Tesla of losing their best factory is too much for the company to survive. They are part of China Inc now, and if they don't like it, China will exercise the terms of the contract Tesla signed and make 2/3rds of Tesla part of China inc.Tesla used Enron style mark to market accounting, which was approved under the Trump admin in 2018 and Tesla immediately switched to it in Q1 2018, restating earnings under this accounting change . It increased revenue by $299M in that quarter and profits significantly, allowing Tesla to continually report profits. This accounting scheme allows revenue to be pulled forward and led to the stratospheric valuations of the dotcom bubble. It also cuts both ways, it accelerates growth and falling, meaning Tesla has had a rosier (and not as profitable) economic picture because of this accounting change, and likely would not have made it into the s&p500 without it. Tesla also pays suppliers on a delta, so revenue is prebooked and costs of production are deferred.The above accounting scheme really benefits a backlog of orders like Tesla has historically had. It also allowed them to play games with Hertz and Carvana inflating orders by placing large non binding orders.Additionally, Tesla has prebooked carbon credit sales that haven't occured yet. They cook the books in a lot of ways.Post 2018, Tesla rapidly went through CFOs that resigned probably because they weren't comfortable with how much Elon wanted them to cook the books. Eventually Elon promoted a young 30ish year old millennial, Zach Kirkhorn to CFO, a position he was absolutely not qualified for. He changed his job title to Master of Coin and bought Bitcoin for Tesla, so he's either an idiot or the Bitcoin was Tesla's attempt to get their stuck money out of China, or possibly both.FSD is Theranos level fraud. The paint it black video was faked, and the employees involved at the time have turned whistleblowers to the media. Tesla isn't transparent with data, but crowd sourced data as well as YouTubers show fsd needs at least a 10000x improvement to match the average driver, if it were to actually drive with no driver baby sitting it. Tesla has one of the highest defect rates of any car manufacturer and highest repair costs on average, but keeps the lowest warranty reserves. The profit margin they have is thus somewhat faked because the long tail of warranty issues isn't sufficiently provided for. Tesla avoids warranty repairs as much as possible by marking them as good will, denying warranties outright, doing stealth recalls, or patching issues via software to hide the failure until the car is out of warranty.Tesla solar is basically dead as a business. The solar roof was stillborn. Tesla semi, the cybertruck, the roadster, and the robot are all vaporware at best, it not actual fraud too. Unlike fsd, they didn't sell them at least.All the fraud stuff won't matter legally until Tesla goes bankrupt. They're gonna go bankrupt because like Enron, their numbers are severely massaged and they're not a super profitable company like their financial reports claim, they're at best a barely profitable company whose structural finances collapse when they don't have exponential sales growth.

So everytime is goes down she buys more to get to the 10%. The reason Cathie made it big in 2020/21 and sucks now is that she is not flexiable at all.

In the future as all car manufacturers enter the space and other headwinds the total addressable market will shrink for them and forward growth becomes less exponential  (which I think why Elon is trying to go into robots or whatever do I think it‚Äôs a idea that makes sense nah but at least he‚Äôs trying to expand. I think where he needs to put more effort is into the subscription and services model but not going to act like I know what he should expand into).
