If you think with 1 hour of research you figured what the market is missing, then I have a flying bridge to sell you.Cyclical pharmaceutical company with lots of uncertainties. Unless you understand their whole portfolio of drugs, your analysis is rubbish. Literally half to PFE revenue last year are COVID related.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 10:24:12'] Projected revenue and earnings guidance for 2023 is 61-71 billion and 3.25-3.45 eps. That would give them a fwd P/e estimate of around 12 which is still incredibly low relative to the overall pharmaceutical industry. I‚Äôm bullish heading into the next earnings report. Especially with the $ weakening overseas sales won‚Äôt be as affected. They also have the Humira generic bio similar launching soon, which brings in billions of revenue for Abbvie.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:57:14'] Why not just invest in an index like SPY that is tech heavy? I respectfully doubt you will outperform the SPY in the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:45:36'] Step 1) Buy stock in non-tech sectors
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 20:19:11'] If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.The 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.The Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.One portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).Well diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.Here is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\_analysis:sector\_rotation\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)Notice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.That portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.Best of luck.going forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks.

Apple, Alphabet, NVDA, AMD, and Tesla are 57-58%Palantir, Coinbase, and Roblox is your high risk stuff 8%I would Use your 10% cash to add to SCHD which are high dividend stocks that hedge against bear markets like 2022. Some of the stocks in SCHD include Costco, Pepsi, Merck, Amgen, Cisco, Blackrock. Then you got 4% in WMT already.So then your portfolio becomes 57% tech, 20% s&p500, 15% SCHD and WMT, 8% high risk stuff Yes out of cash but then either sell the high risk stuff that hasn‚Äôt worked or id chop some apple or Google

The Dow‚Äôs previous intraday record was 29,568.57, about 1,245 points from Friday‚Äôs close.*****> S&P 500 futures jumped 4%. Russell 2000 futures rallied 7%, triggering upside limits set by the CME Group to prevent highly volatile trading moves.*****> Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.5% as traders left crowded growth and stay-at-home stocks in favor of cyclical companies that could outperform if the Pfizer vaccine is approved for widespread use.*****> Stocks were already set to continue their big post-election rally Monday as Democrat Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race to become president elect, according to NBC projections.*****> Dow futures were up about 400 points before the vaccine news.*****> The 90% effective rate from Pfizer and Germany‚Äôs BioNTech was better than what the market was expecting. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that a vaccine that was 50% to 60% effective would be acceptable.*****> ‚ÄúAmazing news from Pfizer with 90% efficacy. This hopefully is the beginning of the end of our fight against Covid,‚Äù Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in an email.*****> ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve been saying on the hopes of this, we need to shift our attention to those parts of the market that have been the most hammered because of Covid and away from the work from home stocks that have had such an incredible year because Covid is not forever,‚Äù he added.*****> Travel, restaurant and hospitality companies that saw their equities swoon in the spring as Covid surged saw some of the strongest rallies on Monday following Pfizer‚Äôs announcement.*****> ‚ÄúIt is materially bullish for stocks in the near term,‚Äù said Tom Essaye of The Sevens Report. ‚ÄúRegarding the data, the 90% efficiency rate in preventing COVID-19 is higher than was hoped for...Given election clarity and the calendar (holiday‚Äôs approaching), a run in the S&P 500 to 3900 is not unreasonable. ‚Äù*****> Shares of cruise-operator Carnival Corp. rocketed higher by 18%, Southwest Airlines jumped 9% and the Walt Disney Company popped 6% as investors bet a vaccine may allow more vacationers to attend its many amusement parks.*****> ‚ÄúI think that the rally is justifiable. I think we‚Äôre going to start a new discussion, and the discussion is what‚Äôs America going to look like post Covid,‚Äù said CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúMad Money‚Äù host Jim Cramer. ‚ÄúIf you think about where we were last week, where we felt that there was very little chance to be able to stop this thing, now suddenly we have hope.‚Äù*****> The Monday rally for equities also marked the first trading day after NBC News projected that former Vice President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election against incumbent President Donald Trump. The call came four days after Election Day and amid close counts in several battleground states.*****> Wall Street hoped the victory for Biden would reduce the odds of a drawn-out election fight, even as Trump refused to concede. Many traders had put on bets for market volatility in November and were unwinding those positions, helping fuel a rally.*****> In the meantime, the chances of a ‚Äúblue wave‚Äù that sweeps Democrats into the majority of both the Senate and the House have waned, meaning drastic policy changes such as tax hikes are less likely.*****> ‚ÄúA Biden presidency with a Republican Senate would be unlikely to see any increase in taxes, which was arguably the biggest fear investors had about a Biden presidency,‚Äù Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, said in a note on Sunday. ‚ÄúAnd a Biden presidency could mean a return to a more traditional, predictable approach to trade policy, which would likely result in less volatile markets.‚Äù*****> Democrats are projected to keep their House majority, although Wall Street was watching closely as Senate control is still in limbo. Both of Georgia‚Äôs Senate races are likely going to runoffs slated for early January.*****> Wall Street had rallied in the past week in anticipation for such a gridlocked government and was set to build on that rally as it gained clarity in the presidential race.*****> All three major averages just notched their best weekly performance since April. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped 7.3% and 9%, respectively, last week, while the Dow rose 6.9%. The S&P 500 also posted its biggest election week gain since 1932.*****> Tech was the biggest winner last week among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, surging 9.7%. Investors piled into the high-growth group as the prospect of higher taxes and tighter regulations under a Democratic sweep decreased.*****# ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/08/election-stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html))

POST_TEXT: b'I bought Pfizer right after the approval of the COVID vaccine. I sold all my shares right now. It lost about four dollars, which cost me a lot of money. I was absolutely baffled. Given that more people are going to take the vaccine, why dont people wait a little longer?\n\nFurthermore, I am baffled by some of the analysts ratings of stocks. For example, Pfizer was rated as Hold despite it dropping almost 10% in three days. A while ago, when Apple fell off a cliff after its good sales report, the stock was rated Buy.\n\nIs there any better indicator of how a stock would perform in the future besides its analyst rating? Because the analyst ratings clearly dont seem to help me at all. They dont budge even when the stock seems to be clearly doing terribly.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 06:56:43'] It was already priced in, people sold the news. I bought puts as soon as the news came out. Usually when people are buying you should be selling and when people are selling you should be buying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 06:57:32'] Everyone knew Pfizer was going to be approved. Your supposed to sell the news. Not buy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 07:19:46']  buy the rumour, sell the news
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 07:51:07'] Don't gamble. Buy something you want to keep for a while (at least a year) and wait for it to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 10:04:31'] I would be careful buying because these companies are getting FDA approval because they aren‚Äôt going to release the so called ‚Äútesting‚Äù of these vaccines until 2025. If this vaccine has been tested why are they waiting to release the testing information, is there something they are trying to hide.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 06:57:41'] It‚Äôs the same things MRNA being up today. People are buying anticipating it‚Äôll be approved and once it is they‚Äôll most likely sell on the pump.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 07:50:43'] Its called insiders knew about the approval before you did! The gains were already priced in during the last few weeks. Look at the run up of 20%. You made a bad call. Dont buy the NEWS buy the RUMOR!

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 21:00:33'] IMO there are certain companies that have a ‚Äúgovernmental‚Äù relationship if you will. They make money but it doesn‚Äôt reflect in their stock price. AT&T comes to mind GE is another example. Older companies that have established markets no matter what is going on. Pfizer is not a volatile stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 07:39:29'] I got 250k at $34.20 I sold at $50 before approval because I had already planned to sell if it hit $50. Pfizer has a shit ton of outstanding shares because it's so old and held by old rich guys and institutions for the dividends. So it's literally a grandpa stock it doesn't run like the young bucks. I'm honestly shocked it got to $50

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 08:19:56'] Buy the rumors, sell the news. I bought put on Monday when the news come out
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 10:13:58'] It is good to follow analysis and statistics when you are a long term investor but remember stocks can "perform" separately from the company. When other people see the news and they know you will buy they can cash in, but don't worry the market should readjust after a while.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 10:21:02'] My brokerage account is with TD Ameritrade and they send me messages to my phone that stocks I own have been downgraded to reduce and then a few days later I will receive another message saying some stock has been upgraded to hold. I don‚Äôt buy stock because of ratings I buy stock of things I think will produce in good times and bad times. I think when you buy into a stock it is probably best to buy some one day and buy more another day. I think you made a mistake selling you haven‚Äôt lost anything until you sell, it is best not to panic because when you do you sell and then lose out. When I buy I plan on holding for at least a year.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 23:09:18'] No thanks ü§ê
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 20:32:45'] People are going to be skeptical, but it is almost certainly true: we'll likely need regular boosters/new versions of the vaccine because it is going to keep mutating, especially since so many people won't be vaccinated any time soon (poorer nations waiting, people refusing the vaccine) and the virus will have plenty of opportunity to keep mutating.  This is a big reason why companies kept working on their vaccines even when it became clear that several early ones would beat them to market by many months: because this is a vaccine that we'll need for a long, long time, and not just 1 year.Hopefully we will have widespread partial immunity and so the yearly COVID outbreaks might "only" kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people yearly without any widespread lockdowns.  Sort of like an extra bad flu season each year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 18:46:18'] LOL how would they make money from tragedy otherwise?  Of course it would be a yearly booster.  Next the healthcare industry will influence politicians to make your booster shot a requirement for public transportation.  ‚ÄúTakes off tinfoil hat‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 09:02:11'] Stop spreading doubt and confusion, when you know nothing about the subject. If you have antibodies and a robust T cell immunity, the virus will quickly be inactivated and killed. Even if the virus is to live for some time in recipients of the vaccine, they will have less symptoms, less viral load and therefore be unlikely to spread the virus. Until heard immunity is accomplished, masks and social distancing will be needed, nothing new about that. BnTX that made the vaccine, has made a huge medical breakthrough with its mRNA technology that is likely to revolutionize vaccination, both against pathogens but also cancer.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone. Ive recently studied various medical companies, and one question occurred.  \nPfizer announced that they have developed a vaccine and are conducting clinical trials on November 9 last year. On December 11, the FDA gave them permission to use the vaccine. In general, the whole fall of last year was full of news that Pfizer is successfully testing a vaccine and is leading in this.\n\n**Question: why hasnt Pfizer's stock price increased last year?**\n\nThe chart doesnt show any visible leaps except for December 11, but even then the stocks went up by only 15%.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the news about the vaccine was objectively high. Thus, the price had to be quite high as well for objective reasons.\n\nMaybe I don't understand how the market and its mechanics work, but really I hope someone here will give me an answer to this question. Thoughts?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 12:20:26'] A $200B company won‚Äôt move much based off a vaccine that will net them very little actual cash flow, they had to pour a ton of R&D into it and the actual outcome will be minimal, it‚Äôs publicity more than it is a revolutionary change in company profits
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 12:20:44'] I listened to a podcast recently that explained it in detail, but basically the vaccine isn‚Äôt a huge source of profit for Pfizer. On top of that, they‚Äôve committed so many of their resources (research funds, time, effort, etc.) to the vaccine development that could have been spent developing more profitable medicines.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 13:12:50'] Simple, Pfizer did not invent any vaccine. The vaccine comes from Biontech/Germany. We just chose Pfizer as big partner for mass production of our vaccine. So all the knowhow and MRNA thingies do not belong to Pfizer. Buy Moderna if you want a American MRNA vaccine owner.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 13:14:16'] They don't make that much from vaccines even PCR tests can make more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 13:54:58'] Pfizer is, give or take, donating this vaccine. In any other case, their stock might have gone up more than what it has.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 15:17:02'] I personally wouldn't invest in a pharmaceutical company based on a vaccine. If you want to invest in health-care I would recommend well health and cloudmd. Personal opinion is a vaccine will not be as effective as hoped due to mutations.... a company called "t2 biosystems" has apparently developed a test that can screen all variants and received gov funding. I haven't personally invested in that one yet but definitely keeping my eye on it. I like buying low:) and cloudmd and well health have not disappointed. Good luck to you I hope you choose a winner
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 16:39:13'] 1) COVID is a world crisis and for humanitarian reasons  they have to sell the vaccine cheap.2) There are many successful competitors.3) Their vaccine is not practical for world distribution.In summery: they are not going to make an important profit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 05:41:12'] PFE is too big, so that only vaccine can't move it a lot. Also the dividend will be a bit reduced later in the year because of the spin-off that already happened.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 06:03:35'] This is just throwing money away
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 10:26:12'] OP DD is lacking, but the vaccine *may* be bigger than people expect (currently common sentiment is it‚Äôs worth nothing and can‚Äôt move the stock, as can be seen by other comments on this thread). In early February, projected 2020 revenues from the vaccine were $15B, with 20-30% margins and half of profits shared w Biontec. ~$2B is over 20% of their 2020 income. Since that projection, 500M+ orders came in, so at minimum revenues will be $20B. If a booster is required, it will be their most profitable treatment (currently pneumovax).The viatris spinoff may seem like a negative at face value, but most would view it as a positive (after all, this is why Pfizer chose to spin them off). Viatris only holds off patent drugs, and was decreasing profits every year. Having shed the slowly dying Viatris, the expectation is for Pfizer to grow. W 80+ drugs in pipeline, 30+ phase 3 or just past phase 3, and covax goodwill likely improving their ability to raise drug prices, I like the odds.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 08:04:50'] I'm always curious to see how markets have evolved over time, and one way to do it is to see what the biggest companies are in different years. It's always interesting to see that different company win and lose and there's no constant winner. In some years like 2000 and 2020, tech wins out. But for 2005 or 2010 energy firms stand out on top. Neither there is a constant sector winner. Apple and Aramco (tech and energy) are now the top 2 but I doubt that will be the case. In the next 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, what companies do you think will come to the top?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 13:33:10'] Apples 2015-2022 market cap quadrupled, while it's net income and global net sales both increased by less than 100%. I get that there are multiple factors at work people buy stock, but interesting to see.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 07:32:38'] First rule to being a new investor (I learned this not long ago). Trust yourself, if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll falsely blame others for your own mistakes. Don‚Äôt listen to someone without skin in the game, everyone and their mother could say to buy a certain stock, don‚Äôt listen to them for shit if they haven‚Äôt already bought it because if they haven‚Äôt then they arnt actually confident. Also this may not relate to you but they sure as hell relate to me and a lot others: DONT FUCK WITH OPTIONS UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE DOING!! I lost a couple grand in a single hour a few months ago, haven‚Äôt touched them since. Godspeed brother.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 11:25:27'] I would not put the other 50 in. New vaccine companies are not that far behind Pfizer and when they release theirs (the other companies) those stocks will go up. Do your research on other vaccines coming out and put the money you were going to put into pfizer into the other companies. That‚Äôs what I would do. If I were you I would hold your pfizer stocks and then aound May when the amount of people getting vaccinated starts to go down, pull it out. When the stock crashes, buy more. This is because in another couple years when the antibodies from the vaccines start to ware off, people will need to get covid vaccines again, and the stock will go back up. Hope my advice helps

I was expecting the two lists to be very different but still surprised to see how big the difference is. Few companies stood to the test of time, expect Microsoft and likes of Exxon from 2000. Many big companies in 2022 are no where near the top in 2000. But in general it appears that consumers and tech are the two main sectors where most companies are from.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 02:16:39'] Wait until 10 years from now.  The mega tech companies will be a LOT larger.   People just do not get that companies like Google have barely even got started.Google just has a massive runway to work with to keep double digit growth for at least another decade.Take a simple one.  Android is the most popular operating system in the world and passed Windows years ago.Yet Google does not charge a cent.   There is well ove a billion devices activated a year.  Just a coupld of dollars per device would add billions to Google's bottom line as no new material expense.The thing that is really going to accelerate their growth is AI.   Watch this video and tell me if you have seen anything more impressive?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdpprICvNIAI is going to completely change the business landscape.    There will be endless things likehttps://blogs.blinx.ai/predicting-3d-models-for-protein-structure-using-ais-deep-learning-software/But NOT just Google.   All of the mega four will be a lot larger.  Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.  Each one has at least one deep moat if not multiple moats.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 09:04:50'] Every stock is a good choice and every stock is a bad choice.What makes the difference between good and bad is you. You need to spend time researching anything and everything you actually purchase.Many brokers give demo accounts and I strongly recommend using it to actually test and see what works well without risking real money.The one thing that I will say that will help you as you develop your trading and begin to really want to explore a live market more thoroughly is look for stocks that provide dividends. You want to be able to focus on when those dividends are paid. Win a stock pays a dividend may or may not be relevant to you based upon what you're trying to achieve with your own trading and investing.Typically speaking, stocks that pay quarterly will pay more each quarter than the stock that pays once a month but that is relative to the time frame of the actual payment. Also each stock pays a different rate compared to another so finding the right ones with the right risk appropriate your situation requires specific levels of research and time to make sure you are thrilled about your research.As far as the amount you purchase, there are really two simple rules that apply to that,1. Never risk more than you can afford to lose,2. Always be willing to lose everything you risk.

Read up on how to judge fundamentals, technical analysis, read charts, and trading strategies. If researching individual companies is too much then research index funds like SPY and QQQ, they are vested across the entire market. You need $ to make $, so I would not start with stocks, invest in yourself first.

Many of these people are in the medical field and noticing what seems to be an uptick in cardiovascular problems. My own family members who rushed to get the vaccine and boosters now believe they have experienced long duration side effects and have higher medical risk because they vaccinated and boosted.  The second and third dose made me so sick, I said I wouldn‚Äôt do it again. It can‚Äôt be good for you if it makes you feel like that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 03:59:56'] Markets reaction is weird. Think it just wants any excuse to sell right now.Moderna prediction is that the MRNA jabs will switch to private sale from next year - they laid all this out to investors last month. They estimate the market for private sales in US will be between $5bn and $19bn per year depending on who gets it. Interesting approach is that MRNA and Pfizer are in discussion with Health Insurance Companies who have to pay out in the event of hospitalisation so theory is the HICs will mandate annual jabs for their customers or premiums are higher. Moderna‚Äôs jab has a higher success rate preventing hospitalisation so they think they‚Äôll have a better sales pitch with the HICs. Moderna think the cost per Jab will rise from $15 to between $75-$100 once it goes private, but obviously fewer customers.Moderna also rolling out their MRNA Flu Vaccine which is in late stages and expected to be available early 2023 - it‚Äôs showing better success than current annual flu jabs. The holy grail will be the combined Flu/Covid MRNA jab but so far Moderna have had poor results with their combined jab efforts. They have two other MRNAs in stage 3 trials not sure what the market is for them. They also have a anti cancer MRNA but can‚Äôt see how that can be made profitable since it‚Äôs a tailored MRNA to an individual so unless you have Platinum Insurance cover or a millionaire, don‚Äôt see how this is profitable. I bought more MRNA yesterday on the sell off‚Ä¶..their pipeline of MRNAs are getting closer and if they have an annual FLU jab and a Covid Jab in the private market their revenue will double while their PE will move to something more pharma normal. All of that ignores them doing a deal with China which would be a game changer - don‚Äôt see that happening personally as Chinese have 2 MRNA vaccines under trial themselves. On the Moderna law case against BioNTech for patent infringement, read an article by a science patent lawyer who has looked at the case. His take is interesting. BioNTech scientists were using the technique Moderna say was infringed as long ago as 2006 and they even filed patents on it, however he reckons these patents weaken Moderna‚Äôs case but doesn‚Äôt make it go away and he thinks Moderna will get a partial victory of sorts. He doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go to court but thinks instead the Patent Office will make a ruling (perhaps even this year) and whatever they say will deliver an out of court settlement. We are just scratching the surface on MRNA tech and with their Covid profits Moderna have been rapidly upscaling their R&D. I think we are going to see a lot of amazing MRNAs come forward in the next 3-5 years that will game change medicine. The important thing about the tech is that Covid took a 10 year approval process on MRNA tech and made it a 1 year process. Anything that Moderna bring forward to CDC for approval is practically cleared inside the stage process so any new vaccine or drug can hit the market really quickly‚Ä¶.RoCs on MRNA are going to be like nothing the pharma industry has ever seen before!

If there\'s a massive demand for it, and the supply is running out, shouldn\'t basic theory come into play and help Pfizer be a more "sought after" company, thus increasing the stock? \n\nI know Purell isn\'t Pfizers only product.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-29 19:56:56'] I disagree that having more phase 2 trials implies a better future position. These are both large cap drug companies with a lot of stuff in development. Who has more winning treatments in the future is a complete unknown, as is the profit margin from each treatment. Some treatments turn out to be medically great but can't make money, others turn out to not be very important but have high margins.They're both undervalued according to fundamentals, but according to S&P Global MRNA is slightly better.It doesn't really matter which one you buy. These are both large companies, with a huge number of investors poring over their books. The rational portion of the valuation should be correct for both them, with everything already priced in. The irrational portion is identical for them because they're so similar. Their 2-year performance is very very similar.One is German, one is American. That's what I'd decide based on.

If we keep having breakthrough infection issues, Moderna‚Äôs dosing model is going to become standard.So moderna chose efficacy over diluting product to deliver more units. Not as beneficial in the short term‚Ä¶but I think it is beneficial for long term brand value.I have small moderna and Pfizer positions (but no BioNTech at the moment) guess which one has been on fire since the oMegaTron news

POST_TEXT: b'Shares of the major pharmaceutical companies behind the Covid-19 vaccines decreased Monday due to a variety of pressure points.\n\nNumbers: The declines on Monday included: 0.72% for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), 0.86% for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), 2.70% for AstraZeneca (Nasdaq: AZN), 4.95% for Moderna (Nasdaq: MRN), 6.90% for Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX), and 7.91% for BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTZ).\n\nBigger Picture: The likely culprit for Mondays decline was due to Singapore reporting its highest Covid-19 cases since last April. Most of the population is vaccinated, so there may not be as many hospitalizations. The country uses the same vaccines that are available in the U.S.\n\nPotential Factor: On Sunday, the CEO of Pfizer said on ABC News that normal life will return in a year.

Only one year isn‚Äôt really that much money for you to make a bunch of money through dividends (especially with the stocks you‚Äôve picked out).

MindMed focuses on different psychedelic drugs including Psilocybin, LSD, DMT and the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC (18-MC has huge potential in opioid withdrawal therapy and doesnt have the side effects of Ibogaine). These drugs are currently being tested in numerous trials to ensure that the treatment methods are effective and safe, but everyone that has ever taken any kind of psychedelics knows about the immense potential which these kind of drugs have. The drugs address all kinds of mental health problems including Depression, PTSD, Anxiety and Addiction.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 16:52:44'] OK, I agree that psychoactive substances are going to be a positive step toward treating mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression (just look at the high rate of effectiveness of ketamine for treatment resistant depression and rapid reversal of acute depression associated with suicidal ideation) as well as ADHD. But to say there aren't already effective treatment for substance use disorder and that " Recent studies have shown that low doses of psilocybin are as effective as the industry standard SSRIs! " is overstating things a bit.There was ONE study which compared microdosing of psilocybin to ONE antidepressant in the SSRI category,  escitalopram. The sample size was very small and promising but many further studies need to be done. In addition, SSRIs may be the first line choice for newly diagnosed persons with depression, however there are still the choices of SNRIs like cymbalta, tricyclics like amytriptilline, SARIs like Brintellix and  & atypicals such as Wellbutrin. Microdosing of psilocybin will take place in a galaxy far, far away, and likely only ever be used for people who have failed at least 2 standard treatments. As far as the usage of MDMA, DMT, LSD are concerned, they are being tested to be used in CONJUNCTION with psychotherapy because they open a persons mind and make it easier for them to discuss tough issues with their therapist. They are not being studied to replace current standard treatment for depression, but to augment the effectiveness of therapy.MindMed is definitely on the right track, especially since they took over a phase 2 study at a University Hospital in Switzerland with an excellent reputation. I plan on buying and holding MindMed, but at this point it's a risky trade and could go to zero as easy as it can climb up and give big returns.It also has competition here in the states. I don't believe they have any active studies in the US, whereas there are at least 2 (I think Emmes and Compass) are carrying out studies in the US.\>
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 23:39:30'] A big problem seems obvious... MindMedicine has no patent rights on any of the said psychedelics. Unless the government granted them exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute a psychedelic they investigate, there's no reason to believe they hold any unique future financial position in their legal used.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 07:54:53'] I did a 10 page DD on GTHX about 3 months ago, but it got such a lukewarm reception (though I never posted it on reddit) that I made my position and tabled it. I could find it if there is any interest but my thoughts were that this one was going to be a 20-40 bagger but 3-7 years down the road (or it could be bought out somewhere along the way, I believe this is very likely for this company), and this is based entirely on Triciclib.  I gave the Rintodestrant a value of about a billion but as you state its risky and the actual value could end up being far more than that and could also end up being 0.  It may work better than fluvestrant or maybe not (I thought it probably did, at least for some patients).  Their other drug candidates (aside from Triciclib) had, in my opinion, minimal value.For Triciclib, however, I figured the revenue stream for the SCLC approval could eventually be as much as 500-700 million a year in the USA alone.  if they are able to actually get revenue anywhere near this, this could cause the stock price to double or triple. However, they are going thru testing of Triciclib with various other forms of cancer.  If the Triciclib works in the other forms of cancer (and it really should, the mechanism by which Triciclib works has nothing to do with the type of cancer so long as the cancer isn't in the red bone marrow itself - where Triciclib works) then these new revenue streams could add 15-22 times the revenue of SCLC, the one approval they currently have.  This could mean a new revenue stream of maybe 10 billion and could mean a 20-40 bagger, though there are risks and you do need to be willing to hold for maybe 3-7 years.Anyhow, that's my 2 cents worth.  Rintodestrant might be great and could make them a lot of money but focusing on that is like saying Tesla makes a lot of money off their charging stations - you are missing the goose that lays the golden egg, in my opinion (but I'm just a retard who may know nothing about anything - do your own DD).

POST_TEXT: b'**Summary**\n\nThe three day rally in the stock market took a pause, with stocks finishing mostly lower. Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot neutralizes the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/o'

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 4, 2020**\n\nStocks hit record levels again today despite disappointing data on job creation in November. The DOW and S&P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.\n\nYesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution. Pfizer, along with partner BioNTech (BNTX) announced plans to ship 50 million vaccines by year-end, half of the 100 million doses previously expected. The company says it still anticipates delivering over 1 billion doses by the end of 2021.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since Aprils record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expec'

POST_TEXT: b'We all know inflation is real and its here to stay for the foreseeable future. As inflation picks up, we already know the FED will have to increase interest rates. The question is - how do we invest with this in mind? Ive been questioning this for months now. \n\nIve heard two theories. The first states that inflation is no real concern for the stock market in general, in fact it states its actually good for the stock market. \n\nThe second theory states that as inflation rises there tends to be an inverse relationship to stock market growth, and specifically company P/E ratios. Growth stocks tend to lose ground as P/E ratios come back down to earth. \n\nI tend to believe the second theory as it makes more sense to me. Low interest rates and easy money for the past decade have fueled a magnificent bull run. As rates go up, and money tightens, I believe well likely see a pullback or correction in the market. To what extent? I do not know. \n\nSo what do we do with this information? Which s'

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 19:05:26'] The financial stocks (banks) will benefit from rising interest rates.  Also you‚Äôre right about the PE ratios - the multiples contract as interest rates go up, and the high flying speculative stocks will be the first snd hardest hit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 20:57:55'] Those are not opposing theories. Both of these things are true.In general, most revenues inflate, too. People forget that, somehow.However, that phrasing of P/E ratios coming down is sortof cart-before-horse. P/E ratios come down-to-Earth as/if growth stocks lose ground.But right now, we've got a lot of high P/E stocks that are not growth stocks, they're just fad stocks. With a real growth stock, the company should be growing, not just the stock price. The high P/E should reflect not only trader preference for the stock, but that the company is more able to invest in growth, which brings down earnings in the short term but is good in the long term, so increases the price. For these fad stocks, inflation can put some emphasis on math that as people try to calculate inflation effects, and that emphasis can become very painful for those investors. This is a bigger potential problem than just growth stocks getting a correction.And there are a lot more truths about inflation, too. For example, companies that can easily raise prices are less affected. Basically that's most companies where the limit on pricing is competition. Like with food, drinks, entertainment. Inflation already means those companies must have higher revenues. There are lots of websites that talk about this and list examples.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 9, 2020**\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs early in the morning before turning steeply negative as stimulus talks in Washington appear to hit a roadblock. \n\nToday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of delaying, deflecting and moving the goalposts during stimulus negotiations. This snuffed out investor confidence that a deal would get done, at least in the near-term. Here at Psycho, we dont expect the passage of more stimulus until a change in White House administration and control of the Senate is decided. \n\nYesterday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin revealed he offered Pelosi a new proposal worth $916 billion.

Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the indexs 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.\n\nThe positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon.

In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \n\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/'

The Dow lagged behind, finishing the day negative, unable to continue yesterdays rally. \n\nThe S&P ended the day 0.42% and the NASDAQ was 0.84% up. The Dow ended the day modestly down, 0.17% in the red.\n\nNew companies will be joining the Dow.

Honeywell ($HON) will replace Raytheon ($RTX) and Amgen ($AMGN) will replace Pfizer ($PFE).\n\nThe number of newly confirmed coronavirus infections in the U.S. has dropped. Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows that the number of new cases fell to around 38,000, and have been below 50,000 since mid-August.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 20, 2020**\n\nStocks fell Friday with market participants concerned at the lack of fiscal stimulus and the surge in coronavirus the last three weeks will make states reimpose restrictions that threaten to stall business activity in an already tenuous economy. An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that '

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 15:53:46'] Excellent summary!  Personally I think there is no chance of additional stimulus unless or until Mitch McConnell is replaced as Senate Majority leader.  He has been defying the wishes of his President and refusing to pass a stimulus bill from the House.  He is still Senate Majority leader so he has the power to block any bills.  So I believe he will continue to do so until that power is taken away from him.

Later on we got another loan with near zero interest  we  have to pay back way after 2021.i think this method is way better for economic recovery since people tend to spend all that money with the combined  reduction of taxes. (of course most of the money goes to buisness expenses  but big chunk stays  free to use.)Republicans really just want to fill their own pockets...

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.\n\nProspects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental fac'

Since then, Amazon has been aggressively beefing up all levels of its distribution of goods to consumers.AWS on its own is a gold mine, but I think the real tale is how important the actual retail side is to our economy. The pandemic revealed how important supply chains are, and Amazon is only getting better at it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-27 17:30:02'] How the hell did you write a recap of today's trading with zero mention of PLTR? Volume nearly twice that of second place NIO, with Citron writing a rather weak hit piece that cut the legs out from an early rally... on top of being the most widely hyped stock on Reddit and quite possibly the stock which has the best potential to go from $10 to $100 over its first year of public trading. Either you're completely clueless as to what actually happened in the marketplace, or you're intentionally dismissive due to the meme-factor this stock reached over its past two-week run up.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020**\n\nStocks fell Friday, one day after the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) recorded new intraday highs. Market participants were disappointed by the weekly unemployment report, which unexpectedly saw new jobless claims rise to the highest level since September, but remain hopeful the grim data will compel lawmakers to pass more virus-related stimulus. \n\nThis Friday marked a quarterly event known as the quadruple witching, during which stock index futures and options, and single equity futures and options, all expire on the same day. This tends to cause trading volumes to spike. This S&P 500 is also set for a major rebalance with the index set to include Tesla, the largest company ever to be added by market cap, in the index by Monday, December 21.\n\nOn Thursday, the Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed fo'

This administration is disgusting.KODK insiders began buying stock in late June when talks would have already been well underway. Then the board issued them all a ton of options on 7/27. 7/28 the news hit of a $765 million government backed loan, initiated by Trump. Stock proceeded to rip to $60/share, and KODK debt holders began converting tens of millions of units into shares which they then promptly dumped on retail idiots thinking KODK is going to go back to $60 because of news like this post. So yeah, it's most likely KODK, but I wouldn't touch it with a 30 foot pole cause it's obviously being engineered to make money for the insiders, Trump and all his cronies. Btw they're also being investigated by the SEC over this.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 10, 2020**\n\nStocks were mixed today, with the major indices climbing back to even after opening the day in the red. A new report by the Labor Department showed new jobless claims surge to more than 850,000 last week, with surging coronavirus cases and the new virus-related restrictions slowing recovery in the labor market. The Nasdaq turned higher and the Dow and S&P 500 were mostly even.\n\nToday, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, which showed there were 853,000 new jobless claims last week, well above the 725,000 expected. Continuing claims, which is the number of people who already filed a jobless claim, also rose. This follows a disappointing jobs report from November. The slowdown in the labor market underscores the economic toll from the latest surge in coronavirus cases. \n\nIn Washington, lawmakers are still far from agreeing on the size and scope of another round of stimulus.

POST_TEXT: b"Merck's COVID-19 pill significantly less effective in new analysis. Merck said its pill showed a 30% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths, based on data from 1,433 patients. In October, its data showed a roughly 50% efficacy, based on data from 775 patients.\n\nThe lower efficacy of Merck's drug could have big implications in terms of whether countries continue to buy the pill from the manufacturer. \n\nIf Merck is granted Emergency Use Authorization with these results, does that significantly lower the bar for other COVID pills like Bucillamine & Paxlovid and open up the market to other drug manufacturers in clinical trials ?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 20:41:57'] I assume they applied for EUA with their interim data of 50% efficacy. So that's probably what the FDA will be primarily looking at. However, the huge drop implies in their second half of the trial the efficacy was around 10%. With a sample size this big it's really unlikely this is due to just statistical variations. It could be a sudden trend reversal due to delta, which would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless by now. Another possibility is they cherry picked a sub group of high risk people for their interim analysis. It would make sense since their orders with the US are conditional on EUA approval and they are gonna allow generic manufacturing in poorer countries anyways. In that case it could be granted EUA just for this subgroup, certainly though the FDA is not gonna simply ignore that if they did.Molnupiravir's Mechnism of Action is basically mutating enough errors into the viral replication so that the replication fails. There is potentially the danger of mutating human DNA as well with unkown long term side effects. On top of that, new variants could evolve faster by this mutation accelerator. Merck's drug looks more and more like a very expensive and ineffective burden with unkown risks involved. My guess is Pfizer's Paxlovid will probably be the answer for high risk population as an antiviral agent and Bucillamine potentially the pill for standard risk population as an anti-inflammatory agent. Even combination of both will be considered since their MOAs work complementary.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 14:08:42'] FDA doesn't care very much about efficacy, they care about safety. Stuff with 2% improvement gets approved if the safety is good enough.High efficacy only matters if it is a dangerous treatment.The implications are all about sales.If they're granted emergency use doesn't move any bars, nobody has a right to emergency use approval, they'll still make each decision separately.Emergency use approval comes down to this: is it useful for patients who might not be able to take the other treatments? Is there some difference to the Pfizer pill that means there are patients who can take Merck's but not Pfizer? That's the real question. If not, then they probably don't get approved. But if they don't know the answer to that yet, and it appears safe, then it gets approved anyway, and the doctors can figure out which to use.

POST_TEXT: b'**Summary**\n\nStocks roared to record highs this morning before tapering off throughout the day. Market participants digested the election of Joe Biden and the release of promising data for a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nOn Saturday, the historical presidential election finally came to a conclusion. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee and former Vice President, was declared the victor after mounting a remarkable comeback in Pennsylvania, a state Trump won in 2016. The Associated Press called the race Saturday morning. Biden promised to work toward uniting a deeply divided nation, calling for an end of this grim era of demonization in America and saying I see no blue states or red states. Only the United States.\n\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, is refusing to concede the election and is mounting a legal challenge, claiming widespread voter fraud. After news broke of Bidens victory, he tweeted I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT! In a statement yesterday, Pres. Trump said, The simple fact is'

The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the other indices, finishing the day roughly 0.5% up. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTechs coronavirus vaccine for use in individuals aged 16 and older. Distribution of the vaccine is scheduled to start today and will prioritize frontline health care workers and nursing-home residents. . In response to the vaccine news, analysts at Bank of America said, With the vaccine now shipping, we expect greater reaction from the broader market over the potential return to normal. However, we caution much work remains to vaccine the population and dont expect to see major progress until mid-2021. In order to safely and fully reopen the economy '

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-05 08:50:34'] Has anyone considered that one of the primary reasons the US economy could fall into recession is the fact that there are **major** supply side labor bottlenecks driven by excessive welfare spending and overregulation that disincentivize working? Small and medium businesses are having an especially difficult time finding local skilled labor regardless how many wage + benefit incentives they offer. There are literally McDonalds restaurants offering $18/hour. Additionally, why wouldn't we encourage more domestic energy production instead of begging OPEC+ to pump pore?

This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.\n\nOn the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.\n\nThe United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020.

Shares of tech companies remain under pressure, with the Nasdaq underperforming the other two major indices.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.79% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.14% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) outperformed, finishing 0.93% up.\n\nYesterday, Pfizers (PFE) and BioNTechs (BNTX) announced that the vaccine candidate was 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 in patients participating in the clinical trial. The news fueled a market rally yesterday, with the SPY and DIA reaching intraday records. However, since the record-highs, both indices have pared gains. Stuart Kaiser, UBS Head of Equity Deritavtives Research, said, I think the big surprise was the efficacy.

Despite the decline, the indexes are still having a great week. \n\nAfter Moderna released preliminary data Monday morning showing its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective in preventing new coronavirus infections, the indexes spiked before losing momentum the next day, very similar to last week after Pfizers (PFE) announcement. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the week plays out, given the similarities to last week. After Pfizer announced its positive vaccine data last Monday, the market spiked Monday before cooling off throughout the week, after it became clear that distribution is still months away. So far its playing out exactly the same.\n\nGoing forward, notable analysts expect near-term volatility in the market but are overall bullish going into next year.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 23, 2020**\n\nStocks rallied Monday, for the third straight week, after more positive vaccine news from AstraZeneca (AZN). The current surge in infections and hospitalizations across the US emphasizes the need for an effective vaccine to combat the virus. Despite record infections, the market has been broadly encouraged by the steady stream of good vaccine news the last three weeks.\n\nOver the weekend, AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford announced the results of their clinical trail which showed their vaccine candidate was highly effective at 90%, relatively cheap, and easy to store. The results are based on analysis of a study involving 11,363 participants in the UK and Brazil. Moreover, the company announced the vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning distribution can be done with existing infrastructure. These developments came on the heels of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX'

Thoughts appreciated\n\nAlso if anyone could give options on other stocks that are similar that would be better investments. \n\nAt this point Ive said all I can say and asked as much as I could but Apparently you have to go and write 500 characters plus and then do a whole bunch of extra stuff just ask a simple question and this is the only question I want to ask but I have to fill in the extra character so I apologize in advance. \n\nLovely weather we appear to be having the economy is the economy him how are you guys doing hope you guys are well bloody bloody bloody bloody election world domination .'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 10:27:31'] I expect Pfizer to go $40 min after earnings release.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 14:10:46'] i bought PFE about 25 years ago at 95 it did a 3 for 1 split so basicly 25 years ago i owned it at $32. im just glad i sold it back then cause its not much higher than what i bought it at then. as for gold - when the market drops, and it will - your gold stock should move up
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 11:18:19'] Gold usually goes down in a hot market like we have right now, it goes up when there is a pullback or it goes into a bull market. I have GOLD on my watch list. I‚Äôm waiting for news of when interest rates are going to go up because I think that will lead to a market pull back this causing GOLD to go up. So it may go down more but it will go back up sooner or later. We can‚Äôt keep printing free money forever and the pullback is coming....just a matter of when. Not financial advice, just stating my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 12:27:52'] Gold is not very volatile and usually goes down in market melt-ups. Inflationary environment and market downturns are when it will rise. I'd personally keep holding my gold stocks

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 16:13:21'] Buffet exited completely of GOLD in Q4 witch was disclosed couple days ago on Feb 16th theres where you pain comes from, also PFE, he sold all that too..doesnt mean you need to sell aswell, but yeah, it be downhill short term..
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:26:40'] PFE is delivering 9+ million doses and growing every week now, and from now on. They're expecting $60 billion in revenue for 2021. It's only a matter of time before someone notices.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 08:16:13'] I can't really speak to Gold, but regarding PFE... I've been in since Nov and averaged down again and again. Painful. On another thread I suggested I might come off as a shill, but the reason I've stayed in is that it has a decent yield on the dividend (.39 / qtr / \~4.5% annually) and now at the current price, you have an opportunity for significant > SP movement. Price has behaved differently last few days, which is to say good. Don't know if MM manipulation behind us (it never really is) but at least price was free to move up.  When they post Q1 results it's very likely price will move up again as the benefit of a full qtr of vaccine rev/profit will reveal itself. And not being a one-trick pony, PFE has much to crow about of late, e.g., cancer drug and FDA approval 3/3. And. by the way, the PFE vaccine is hands-down the best of the vaccines with gov'ts worldwide buying in... Brazil may be next. I like the where it's going.

I figured, smart move even if they don‚Äôt come out with a vaccine, they can produce and distribute for whoever does, made very minimal gains with the stock. BioNTech, same as Moderna, a lot of pharmaceuticals in the pipelines. Again very minimal gains.I‚Äôve found, although not as quickly as some would like, ETFs in pharmaceuticals are profitable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 12:50:58'] So what does this mean for ABUS?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 15:57:28'] This is not as straightforward as it looks.For those who are not as familiar with Abus as I am just a couple of words of warning. 1) This court case is NOT an infringement case, it is a case brought by Moderna to try to say that Arbutus' claims are not patentable. If the court rules again that the 22 claims are patentable then it does not mean that Moderna have to pay yet.To get an injunction you have to prove it is in the public interest this cannot happen in this case as it is a vaccine. So Abus has no legal avenue to stop them. The likelihood is that Moderna will continue to drag it out for a number of years. Assuming they will settle is a risky strategy.2) Arbutus have ATM shares to sell, primed and ready, they cannot hold a gain. You will experience 10% dilution in a very short space of time.3) Be aware that Genevant basically own Abus. They have the option to increase their ownership to over 50% later this year, talk of a buyout is pumper talk (or ignorance) and extremely unlikely.I'm not saying don't buy Abus but I have done a lot of DD and I would strongly advise you to take the spike and leave, it will not hold the gain. Either that or you hold for min a year. GLTA
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 19:16:33'] PFE licensed the tech from Genevant which was assigned the tech by ABUS who gets 20% of the royalties.The judge in the patent court indicated that MRNA used ABUS tech.ABUS has a former patent judge on their board.  In the end the tech will remain in ABUSs control and MRNA will owe royalties - just as PFE has agreed to with their arrangement with Genevant.  ABUS stated that they were entitled to royalties in their last CC.  Look at how many doses of these vaccines are being ordered.  The royalties will amount to tens of millions of not more for ABUS.

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**\n\nStocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressures and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.\n\nMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be tran'

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 00:15:04'] $OPK OPKO Short squeeze w/ short term and long term prospects. Not just a trade. Mark Cuban heavily shorted. Blackrock & Pfizer highly interested. Make them pay fair price.**Opko** is a diversified pharmaceutical company. OPKO owns Bio-Reference Labs performing COVID-19 tests making OPKO profitable starting in Q2 of 2020. High demand has expanded Opko's bottom line significantly, with more testing money in Biden‚Äôs 1.9 Trillion stimulus package. Bio-reference labs performs testing for the NFL, NBA, NHL, Winter X Games, U.S. Soccer's Women's and Men's National Teams and the NBA G League.The company also has a commercialized kidney medication, Rayaldee, which is eligible for over $899 million in [milestone payments](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/what-is-a-biotech-milestone-payment.aspx), as well as 10%-plus royalties from its distribution partners. Its growth hormone replacement therapy, Somatrogon, demonstrated superiority against other drugs in its phase 3 clinical trials. The company is on track to submit a Biologic License Application for Somatrogon to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval by the end of the year. The estimated market opportunity for Somatrogon is upwards of $3 billion annually. In 2014, Opko gave **Pfizer** ([NYSE:PFE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pfizer-inc/pfe/)) an exclusive license to market growth hormone somatrogon globally. Pfizer paid Opko $295 million up front with the opportunity for Opko to receive up to $275 million in contingent milestone payments. Opko stands to receive tiered royalties on somatrogon's potential sales from the high teens to mid-20s. Those royalties seem more likely than ever now. Pfizer plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval for somatrogon by the end of this year. The big drugmaker expects to submit for approval of the drug in Europe and Japan in the first half of 2021. Street rumor see public info - BlackRock may want to purchase #OPKO income streams. #OPKO is also a potential takeover target of Pfizer due to the revenue sharing agreements already in place.  Plus a great pipeline of future opportunities. Based on internals Opko stock would look surprisingly cheap even if it not for the coronavirus market opportunity. Hedge funds and institutional investors are increasing their positions on the cheap, using shorts to artificially deflate the price. NOTE ‚Äì I am just a retail trader like you. This is my own opinion on $OPK using public information available to all. **Do your own research before investing.** This short squeeze opportunity actually makes money and has a pipeline of new innovative products. Together we change the world, and equalize wealth inequalities brought on by the stock market for decades. Stop socialism for the rich.

	COMMENT: ['2019-07-09 06:47:22'] Therapeutic drugs take months, if not years, to hit the market and become profitable for a company. Being on the right path towards FDA approval doesn't mean anything. What about Phase I clinical trials? Phase II? Phase III? What about FDA approval odds? How quickly can Sarepta scale up? When does it become profitable? What if the company gets bought out by Pfizer?So many variables at play here. I love researching and investing in Biotech companies same as you but I wouldn't sip the Kool-aid just yet.Edit: Just adding that I clearly haven't researched this drug yet. I'm just adding that one positive PII trial or PIII trial doesn't mean much. FDA approval could still take months/years. And even then, Sarepta could be unattractive simply due to the fact that they've burned through so much cash in the meantime.I hope that you're right and the drug gets approved and you make a killing on this trade. I just think that you laid out all of the optimistic reasons why they're going to the moon just because another company failed.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-09 11:33:54'] Your investment thesis is that you purchased it today and its up 1.5%? are you kidding.  I first bought SRPT in February 2014 when it was around $30, i added to it through 2018, occasionally playing options coming up on big FDA dates. I held through the bad when the adcom went poorly and it dropped to $11, wiping out almost my entire investment, and losing 5 figures overnight when my options went to nothing. There was a point in time that i think i knew more about the company than anyone not on a Sarepta w-2. i had a friend that worked at an elite college in biostatics look over all the data i could gather from the studies. i watched every minute of the adcom, i read every release. It was what i thought was the best investment i had ever come across to date. I think there were 2 analysts covering the stock back then, and neither was paying attention. Ill never forget reading an analyst report that had failed to include the small detail that SRPT had raised something like $300m the prior month, yet spoke about running out of cash. Then Brian Skorney at Baird began covering it, and hes nailed it the whole way along. Hes the only one worth reading. Let me explain this to you very clearly: Small cap biostocks are not "very safe investments", and "conservatively" expecting +30-40% is moronic, mostly because its clear you havnt actually done the cash flows and figured out a real valuation. &#x200B;If anyone has any questions, please send them my direction. &#x200B;Sincerely,# Long for 1981 days.

POST_TEXT: b" There's a ton of DD on these already, so I don't need to say more. I want to analyze this from the position of political science and economics.\n\nLet's start saying that I agree Ocugen is a very risky play because even if the data out there already suggests that it will be a cheap and effective vaccine, covaxin is ENTIRELY depending on getting approval in the US. There are several reasons to be bullish:\n\n1. Biden is relying heavily on technocrats. That's why he doesn't say anything public - he does backdoor deals to try to get policies through, taking the load of Manchin and other centrists. Remember, Biden was in the Senate for decades and was vice-president, that's just him.\n\n2. The technocrats are former Obama folks. Their BIG push right now is the Quad, which is a quasi alliance designed to contain China. South Korea and Japan are the weak legs - they hate each other due to history issues. India is the absolute key to the quad and the Indo-Pacific Strategy  \n\n3. Covaxin is India's "

POST_TEXT: b'Ive been holding a large position in JWN for about 5 months now. I first bought in on June 11 which was right after it crashed from $24 to $17. Ive added monthly ever since and my average price is currently $15. Theres still a lot of upside to this stock, Im sure. I have to admit I was a little surprised to see the downtrend/flatlining from June - November which was not at all as volatile as March to June. Id expected it to keep on being quite volatile. Anyway, its all good now I suppose. Im hoping the new floor is more like $15 or preferably $17, obviously rather than ~$12 which has been the support level the past 3 months or so. \n\nVirus numbers are increasing day by day (but I suppose more people are getting tested now compared to earlier this year so that explains part of the increase). Still, Bidens Covid team announced they wont go for another lockdown as did Trump which is why JWN kept climbing, initiated by the promising Pfizer vaccine news. \n\nEarnings are coming up and'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-14 14:07:58'] Brick and mortar stores have been getting hammered... even if they survive the pandemic, many of these stores rely heavily on passersby and through traffic. If their neighbors are shut down because they didn't have the deep pockets to survive, that's going to create huge problems for those who did, and for years to come until those vacancies are filled. Many people also learned about online shopping and may never look back.

The futures markets will be open, but on an abbreviated session. Opening at the normal 6pm eastern time on Sunday. But then halting at 1pm eastern time on Monday. With the reopen at 6pm that evening.
