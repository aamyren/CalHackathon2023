POST_TEXT: b'WTF is going on with NVDA? It keeps going up and it doesnt seem like it will stop anytime soon. I read some comments in about a couple weeks ago that many people are shorting @320 but it seems a pretty bad idea based on its trend lately. Whats your thought?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:40:45'] Nvidia is insane. If you had Nvidia‚Äôs market cap in cash, you could buy all of AMD, all of Intel, and all of TSMC and still have 30 billion left over. If that‚Äôs not madness I don‚Äôt know what is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 12:04:52'] Everyone is asking AI what to buy and AI is just listing companies that are long it‚Äôs survival and advancement.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 13:01:07'] AI is driving it but it's hilarious how low the AI related revenue projections are for some of the semiconductors. Someone posted on here that AMD is projected to get up to $1B in revenue from AI. That's it. And that was the high end.I am staying away because it's really not clear how the AI industry will translate to profits.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 16:56:24'] Because they closed a partnership with ServiceNow to custom train models for any company and more such enterprise contracts are expected to roll in.While OpenAI was off building ChattGPT nvidia was off attempting to democratize AI and this seems to be the first wave of their success.This is being seen as validation that they are transitioning from hardware only sales to hardware and software/ service revenues in AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:24:49'] There is a huge AI boom right now, and NVIDIA basically has a monopoly on graphics cards used for training LLMs and neural networks because of their CUDA API.Many companies are panic buying massive amounts of GPUs designed for training and running neural networks.The AI boom certainly has an impact on the extreme increase, but NVIDA is essentially powering all AI projects right now, which, IMO, is the most important factor to consider.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 19:51:00'] Here are better questions; why should it go down? Is there devastating news derailing their industry‚Äôs business? Are they expected to make less money over 5+ years? Is their industry becoming obsolete? If no, what is the negative selection bias? They are clearly on the bleeding edge of tech. They invented the graphics card. They have a huge moat. If AI takes off, they will profit full stop. Until there is a reason to believe they are not doing well, why shouldn‚Äôt they go up? Because they are overvalued? Where in the stock market are companies equally valued when compared among sectors? Basic material stocks don‚Äôt command the same prices as industrials stocks even with comparable growth trajectories and evaluations. Is Amazon trading at a reasonable multiple? What about coca-cola, McDonald‚Äôs, or Walmart? Based on historical S&P 500 averages, the answer is no for all of them. But if the company isn‚Äôt going to go out of business, what is the likelihood you think you will make money overtime? Unlike many sectors, semiconductors have their futures mapped out 5+ years on their expansion trajectory. Currently, NVIDIA‚Äôs 10 year Avg CAGR is 20%+. What is your argument for why Nvidia is going to be dethroned, because until sentiment changes, their stock trajectory is going to continue with its growth inertia. We are going into an economic downturn that everyone believes will not last for an extended period of time. That means future projections are inconclusive, so the bet is I am getting in cheap on a 5 year retrospective scale given the businesses consistency. Additionally, keep in mind a subsection of the stock market is all short term momentum trading. It‚Äôs like betting on the weather, the best indication of tomorrow‚Äôs weather is what happened today.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 13:10:57'] Playing NVDA is a gamble but it's a way riskier gamble to go against such a major trend.. to short it like you're suggesting... would be such a bad idea. Even if it happened to work out.. it'd be pure luck and the odds are definitely not in your favor.The best way to play NVDA is to just buy and hold if you want to play it. I bought AMD a few days ago personally because I think it has more upside than NVDA from here.

It would need a huge amount of shorting to move the needle. No hedge fund managers would have balls to do so. Thus, it would be a bad idea to short the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 19:17:47'] It‚Äôs going up because more people are buying than selling it. Even though it is overpriced, this trend will continue until people get fearful and start selling more than buying.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/13t97uk/should_i_sell_nvda/'
POST_TEXT: b'I have about 1000 NVDA. From vested RSU. \n\nShould I sell some of them? If yes, how many?\n\nOr do we think NVDA is going to increase significantly more in 5-10 years?\n\nThe rationale for selling would be to lock in the profits and invest in other stocks that might have higher chance of going up where NVDA might not have enough growth left in it in mid term.\n\nWhats a good strategy?\n\nThanks!\n\nUpdate: I have decided to sell about 250 of them next week unless the price drops below $380.\n\nThanks everyone for taking the time to respond. Appreciate it.\n\nUpdate 2: If you are curious about my own opinion as someone in the deep learning industry for 5/6 years, my forecast is we are NOT in a bubble. The hype of AI is justified. NVDA might actually cross $500. But I still want to realize at least some profit.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:51:09'] No one knows.  Yesterday I sold off my NVDA profits to invest elsewhere and will let the original investment ride.  Felt like a good middle ground but we‚Äôll see.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 10:05:23'] I think you‚Äôd be crazy not to sell some. If it were me, i‚Äôd sell 750 shares and let 250 ride long term
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:42:42'] You still work for them? If yes, I would sell some. You don‚Äôt want a huge portion of your cash flows and your net worth to come from the same source.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:02:25'] Trim at least 50% at this point and sleep well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:44:35'] It's ridiculously high right now...buuuut a lot of the people shorting it last week are probably getting margin calls now. I expect it'll get another pop this coming week before it comes back down to earth. That being said, a lot of analysts have price targets putting it up as the 5th, 4th or even 3rd biggest company in the world within a year.Also, there's speculation of a massive recession this summer which would surely retract all tech stocks. So I guess what I'm getting at is nobody knows. But if you've got great profits from it already, why not take em now?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:43:48'] I mean what‚Äôs the MAX you could get from it now? If it gained 200% it would be at Apples valuation and the largest company in the world. It‚Äôs possible but this stock won‚Äôt be doing a 5X+ anytime soon

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:46:49'] With RSUs specifically, I always recommend to slowly sell at least some along the way. You will continue to receive free stocks, so sell the new ones as they vest (minimizes capital gains taxes). You don't have to sell them all; you can sell half or 25%. This is basic asset & income stream diversification. While NVDA is doing great now, who knows what the future holds. A catastrophic event that leads to a loss of your job will also impact your RSUs

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:45:49'] IMO when a stock shoots straight up on the chart, for any reason, it's time to consider GFTO or trimming your exposure. look at the Cisco chart from 2000. like Nvidia, it's a big well-managed important company and the stock price still hasn't recovered from the dot-com bubble when Cisco shot straight up like a rocket.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:08:27'] They amount of money you can make selling covered calls is amazing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:32:55'] I‚Äôd sell asap. They are so overvalued, and can‚Äôt possibly support a another big run. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôd be lucky to be 1T in 3-5 years. If you have a multi bagger, realize that‚Äôs not just going to continue with their revenue and profits. Don‚Äôt be greedy, enjoy the success from what you had.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 10:24:56'] I would not sell Nvidia as long as it continues to climb. Once it stagnates for a week or two.. then think about selling.. but the upward trend is still going so why sell? Makes no sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:05:45'] Is 400k a life changing amount of money for you? If yes.. then you should sell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:52:12'] there are multiple things to consider here:-- How much weightage does it have in your portfolio? Do you still work there? If the weightage is high or you are still working there it should be good to diversify depending on how much your financial well-being is dependent on 1 stock.-- Tax.-- Majority of your long-term portfolio should be in index fund I beleive.-- Nvidia is ridiculously overpriced right now but we don't where it will go... it can stay irrational till Nvidia makes it rational or it can burst.-- Another way can be to diversify it into other ai stocks like MSFT or TSMC but that requires your own dd.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:49:46'] I would sell a deep itm Covered Call (say maybe $200) on a long duration contract maybe Dec. (If you want to keep your shares or haven't had them over a year. (And want to book profit at a long investment tax rate)This is your hedge on a crash of the stock... You can either hold the premium and buy more later at a lower price or invest in something else. You can also roll these contacts later if the stock is still above $200... If the stock is below $200 then let it expire.I did this with NVDA in my IRA, I had been wheeling 100 shares then the stock split x4 so I sold $180 call when stock hit $280 post split for 6 mth contract. Obviously growth stocks crashed the next year and those sold calls expired worthless and I was able to book full premiums. I did buy another 200 shares when NVDA was at $120ish and I did the same thing when it hit $330 before earnings (obviously I have sold CCs a bit early to catch peaks....but üîÆ) selling $230 December calls.In essence I am wheeling NVDA still... As I did buy those 200 shares via a CSP so true cost was about $106 if you count the premium I got from selling the Put.Anyways this is how you can book profit without selling underlying stocks especially if you feel good about the company long term.... but know that it has significant volatility. I am also doing this with TSLA btw...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:46:57'] Take 50% out and out it into VOO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:54:08'] Maybe sell some out and keep some? I think Nvidia can keep growing and increasing in value, but if you want to lock profits since you have 1000 shares you could sell a portion to lower your risk on a drop, lock profits and keep enough to make more if it continues to rise. It's what I'd do. Not financial advice just a different perspective
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:58:48'] That‚Äôs worth talking to a professional about since you will have major tax implications. That‚Äôs my first thought. I‚Äôd then ask you what the money would mean to you now, and what an X% gain or X% loss would mean to you in 5-10 years. There is some really bad advice in this thread, btw. So many factors to consider here that an advisor with an equity compensation focus would be able to figure out with you. Also, congrats!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:11:38'] I can‚Äôt tell you whether or not you should sell. But if you feel like now is a good selling point, sell some slightly (or further) OTM calls so you can rake in some premium. Even sell at the money if you want. Get paid a bit more to sell your shares. If they expire worthless, that‚Äôs extra cash in your pocket and you can continue selling calls until your shares are called away.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:09:22'] If you want to get some profits on it, think it can go higher, but good selling 20%-50% of shares I would sell covered calls. One option is Aug 18 $400 and get $31+ for it. Scenarios:  Does not get to $400.  You keep the shares and the premium of $3100/contract which in the above you sell 2-5 contracts. But what if it drops to $300.  You missed the chance to sell at $390 but you still got $31/share.  But you noted longer term you think it goes higher.  So you still have that. Goes over $400 maybe to $500+.  Welp you get the $400 + $31 or $431 which is 10% higher for 82 days.  Typically a nice return and is over 40% annualized.   Problem is you cap your gains but is still better than selling outright at $390 unless you know of another that will make more than 10% in 82 days. It might be NVDA, which if you believe that then don‚Äôt sell any.  You could always do a higher strike as well or different duration. You could do same expiration but $430 and get $20 premium.   If it does exceed $430 you are still locking in 15%+ gain. If it doesn‚Äôt you get over $2k/contract.  Point it there are other ways to play this other than outright sale especially if you believe NVDA will be higher longer term
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:28:26'] Nvidia is in pure gambling speculation at the moment. There's literally no correct answer because the stock isn't based in reality anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 10:57:07'] Nvidia is in the hype mode. No one can answer this question. Nvidia is actually cheaper today then they were last week. Because that's how much growth they are reporting.On paper Nvidia looks way overvalued. But the reason it's valued that way is because of unprecedented growth that's being priced in. Do you think they will grow as much as the price suggests? No one knows.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:53:15'] Lmfao sell it all that shit isn't real. You will get another entry point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:16:22'] I would sell a quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:21:38'] It broke out above it‚Äôs all time high based on earnings.  It‚Äôs trading at something like a 40 forward P/E which is a bit spendy but nowhere near bubble territory.  There‚Äôs room to run.  Sell when they start naming stadiums after Nvidia and celebrities start endorsing various services or hardware.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:27:12'] For a rally like this I would look for the first sign of a reversal to take profits on at least 25%.Someone else in the chat mentioned the potential for margin calls in the coming week or so which I think has some validity. There was almost certainly a margin call post earnings around 6pm on Wednesday. A large bid was seen chasing the ask with around 10000 lots. This however was aggressively eaten up as soon as price entered the $390-$395 range. The next morning another attempt to break $400 was aggressively shorted suggesting an institution is very happy to add/initiate shorts at this level or take profits aggressively.The question I ask myself is, what institutions are happy and willing to buy at this current price instead of waiting for a pullback to a more reasonable level ($300-$350)? I always try to do what the institutions are doing, and right now it is more probable that they are taking profits instead of adding to their long positions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:00:11'] The prevailing thought here and elsewhere is that it‚Äôs currently expensive, so clearly hold because it‚Äôs going higher.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:46:53'] I sold at $390 after I'm up 210% in a short period of time. I see it like that: I'm pretty sure it might go higher due to the AI hype but I can't justify the fundamentals anymore at these prices. A lot of success is priced in already and I won't hate myself if it goes up till $450 or so. It just felt great to sell and lock in the profit. I think you should just be consequential with your principals, I try to watch on fundamentals and search undervalued companies and this one doesn't fit the bill anymore right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:10:23'] I would be selling calls against my position. Sell 10 of the June 2025 $500 Calls for $76-78k. Your break even is $576-578. If the stock starts to challenge that price you roll it up and/or out for more premium. If the stock starts to drop you buy it back at half the price and keep the premium.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:30:08'] In response to your update 2 as someone who is also in the ML for 10+ years.  AI right now is in a bubble mostly because the market prices it as if everyone will implement it right now.  Large services have been doing that for years.  Mid-size businesses don't have the skills/knowledge/manpower/budget to implement it right away.The news loves to talk about AI taking orders for fast-food restaurants.  A person getting paid $15/hr at a fast-food place takes orders, fills orders, and does general cleanup when needed.  Removing one part of that responsibility doesn't justify removing that person.  That's before we take the cost of implementation into account - assuming AI doesn't take the order incorrectly.What the heck can AI do for Bestbuy that its computer system doesn't already do? Inventory management is already smooth and AI definitely won't be able to sell me a new drier when I don't need one.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 10:11:05'] Well do you see it going to 2 trillion in market cap by 2030 or are there other stocks out there that seem like a better opportunity for gains? If you are trading instead of investing who knows when the pump higher will stop. In a overhyped market we have seen stocks reaching insane levels for example the dot com bubble so as a trader the sky is the limit but if you approach as a investor there must be a point where the stock is at a point where you can easily find better returns elsewhere. In my opinion it is over valued for the next few years and I personally dont see it reaching a 2 trillion market cap by 2030. Yes nvidia has the best performing cards but that doesn't count out companies like amd and intel yet. No one knows what tech will look like in 2030 yet. And if they do they are just making up some bs. Some companies may weigh cost verse performance and instead rely on other cards. Some companies will design their own in house hardware. So at this point it is hard to tell what nvidia will look like by then. I am sure they will be successful but not the extent of being a monopoly as people are saying. I can definitely see them being a leader for sure but as I said they are pricing in growth for a long time here and there are just better opportunity in the market for returns for over the next few years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 10:16:47'] Its never bad to take profit. Being greedy can cause you to miss the opportunity to make a profit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:09:25'] No one knows. If you don't have a systematic approach to trading you will lose money on the long term. Looking for advice on Reddit tells me you don't have a system and should not trade (to be fair, the vast majority of people shouldn't trade).The market is unpredictable. Why try to predict it?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:15:13'] Depends on your strategy. You can set up stop losses at different prices and you can you can set take profits at higher levels. I would sell everything by the 100 day Ema, but that's just me. A good idea is to look at the MACD when NVDA sells off typically and sell there. If you believe the stock has room up, it will make another upwards sloping structure once the pull back happens and you can dump the same original capital you had at that price.Then you can take your profits and do whatever you want. Diversify or double down. I'm a bigger fan of buying some dividend paying stocks.None of this is financial advice. I'm regarded.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:38:51'] It seems like locking in some of the profits is very prudent.  Depending on your age, and how soon you need the money.  But I would think selling 35% would be a good start.  ( This is from someone who wishes he would have sold 50% of a big tech stock in 2021 and bought a beach house.  Instead it is down about 60%)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:44:26'] I didn't read through this whole thread but has anyone seen the NVDA prospectus filed with the SEC Friday evening for a $10 billion public share offering? They did this in February of this year I think as well. Doesn't really make a lot of sense to me since they seem to have plenty of cash. It dropped the price around 2.5% last time. Not sure how big of a deal to them this really is but it's sure to smack the fomo in the dirt a little.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:46:57'] If you had 400k cash, would you invest it all into NVDA?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:53:00'] Yeah concentration risk is real. Decide what portion of your portfolio you feel comfortable allocating to a single stock and sell until you reach that. Also remember that since Nvidia is also your employer you have a lot of your eggs in one basket at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:00:52'] I always diversify from my RSU from a safety perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:02:51'] If you think it could still go up, it‚Äôs worth holding. But there‚Äôs no shame if, having found yourself hitting for a lick, cashing out and moving your money somewhere less risky.I‚Äôm risk averse, so if it were me I‚Äôd sell and roll it somewhere else, but I also probably wouldn‚Äôt have bought it in the first place, so find an appropriately sized grain of salt.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:22:50'] On Monday like 4 ITM weekly covered calls with Friday exp at a strike that you're happy with, collect that fat premium. If they get called away, you sold 40% of your holdings at a price you're happy with, keeping 60% for the ride and the premiums from the 4 CC's. If NVDA drops below your strike by Friday, free premium and you keep 100% of your holdings. Rinse and repeat in both scenarios for more premiums and trim possible while taking profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:24:34'] Take some profit, like, sell 125% the value of your original investment. That way you can let the rest of your shares ride the waves, an if it never goes that high again, you'll be satisfied knowing you reaped a 25% profit.

Keep and hope to catch a little more upside from the hype-train or lock in gains knowing you may miss some more upside. But to think there will be zero competition that can catch up or eat their market share forever is silly
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:46:57'] To lock the profit I would sell probably a third of them, maybe a fourth of them if I‚Äôm really bullish about NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:49:25'] I‚Äôd sell covered calls at a strike you feel comfortable selling them at. That way, if it hits your strike, great since you were gonna sell them at that anyways. If it doesn‚Äôt, now you have free money from the premium

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:11:26'] Nvda is here for a while. You may want to consider how many shares get you your initial investment back. Or at least half. It the market craps out, buy some back with the profit, if it doesn't go to crap, you have locked some profit in, and if it goes up, you just  make less, but really have lost nothing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:17:22'] What is your cost basis? I wouldn't sell a lot in case you have to pay a ton of taxes. Maybe sell like 10 shares a month for a few years?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:18:33'] I would sell now tbh then buy it again but the truth is no one knows
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:24:11'] I would definitely take some money off the table. Im not saying Nvidia wont go up, but I suspect it will have a correction before taking another big leap up. It could easily be that it creeps upwards over the next several years, or it could just as easily take a dramatic correction.My main concern is that the p/e ratio is super high. A 200+ p/e ratio?!?!? With that in mind it is a great company and will be worth a lot of money in the future, but the price it is at right now at the very minute is too high. So if it was me I would either get my initial capital off the table and leave the profits, or take the profits and leave the initial capital amount on the table. Then you could do several things with that money. One possible idea..... sell a cash secured put for a few months out with a strike price a good bit below the current price. If the stock corrects you could basically pick back up some of your share count and pocket some money. Or you could put the money into a broader tech heavy etf. Or you could sit the money on the sidelines and wait... or you could use the profits to diversify your portfolio into a more defensive position. If you do leave your all your money on the table I wish you luck, but I suspect it will burn you in the short to medium term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:27:44'] You could sell 30dte ATM covered calls and collect 2k per lot.20k in premium if you wanted to sell them all.Would give you a little downside protection as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:29:56'] I'd trim 30% or so....but i'd ride the rest out for several years. GPUs...data centers etc are not something niche...its the underbelly of the new economy. I couldn't sell (the entirety...or even half) a leader in the space so soon.  It WILL LIKELY correct a good bit at some point, but long term, I don't think this will be the highest it will be, nor do I think it will be a laggard over the next 10 years, even with the pull forward as of late.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:30:19'] Yes

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:48:33'] You could sell 5-7 covered calls ATM and collect a nice premium, assuming they will get called away. I typically do this when I have something I should sell but don't want to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:24:10'] I feel like NVDA is a great long term buy. Graphics, gaming, AI , self driving - they have their hands in everything and are the leaders in the technology. Price dipped when China got cut off and crypto GPU mining ended, but in the long run I believe these will dwarf in comparison to future revenue. Buy and hold would be my strategy, maybe even some calls

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:37:01'] You work in tech like me so you know we are in an AI bubble fueled by execs who want to cash out their stocks & have been selling left & right.NVDA is currently the most overvalued mature company & you well know the datacentres don't need insane number of GPUs to run pretrained models. There will be a surge in next quarter or two & then it will normalize just like crypto.OpenAI itself is valued at $29bn, NVDA added $300bn in a few minutes based off OpenAI's hype, that's not sustainable.Nobody knows if the bubble will get much bigger before bursting or when it bursts but I would take some profit so I won't regret & maybe let some of it ride...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:24:54'] At some point you should cash in enough to get back your cost-basis.  I don‚Äôt know your cost-basis, but a 100% increase is a good time to do it.  It‚Äôs tough with $NVDA because it seems to have room to run.  It‚Äôs your call if you want to hold out a little longer.  Whenever you take some $ off the table, hang onto the cash and put it to work when the time is right.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:24:51'] If everything is in NVDA, I think you should diversify about 2/3 of your portfolio into other industries such as healthcare, real estate, or consumer non-cyclicals such as PFE, EQR, COST and MO. Or maybe have a large part of your portfolio in an exchange traded fund such as VTI or VOO.Edit: You should also beware of the capital gain from the sale at a profit. And keep some of your savings and investments in short-term bond funds or money market accounts that pay a reasonable yield.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 04:31:23'] I used to be a wealth advisor in the 1990s. Plenty of people asked me this exact same question. Nvidia stock is priced now as a speculative investment. There is no grounding in any sort of realistic financial outcome. Ask yourself if you would take that same money and gamble with it at a casino. Can you make more? Sure. But probability says you will eventually walk away with a lot less. The stock market has become very bifurcated. 5 stocks are driving 70% of the gains. Maybe look at diversifying into something more reasonably priced.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 04:59:17'] Incremental sells moving up would be my suggestion. Sell 50 shares now. Keep selling bit by bit all the way up. Might make you feel better. Take some of the tension away. But patience should pay off here. Breath.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 08:13:04'] I think the easiest way to know when to sell is to determine what percentage you want it to make up your portfolio, then balance accordingly. I let my shares run until it hits about 40% then trim down to 20-30%, whatever feels comfortable at the time that won‚Äôt cause me to panic sell if it crashes. I try to keep it closer to 20% but with NVDA over the years I‚Äôve had such massive gains I let it ride a little higher.

POST_TEXT: b'Wild times guys. To summarize, NVDA reported super bullish guidance for coming quarters, average yearly estimate was $30B in revenue, which may now be somewhere between $40B-$50B. We will be seeing lot of upgrades from analysts in coming days. I am still puzzled as to how this was already not priced on with almost 100% run in last 6 months alone. Now stock is up another 26%.\n\nAmazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.\n\nCan someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate. \n\nTrying to figure ou'

I am exposed to it via ETFs anyway, and I prefer to wait for a correction.I know it‚Äôs a relative risk (I can imagine that if crypto goes for another rally it would impact NVIDIA again) and I am still resenting myself as I was thinking to get in for the past couple of years but never did on the usual ‚Äòovervalued‚Äô argument.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:15:16'] It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.And while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.I think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.Personally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough.

Enterprise/dev tools, GeForce Now etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 23:42:20'] Keep in mind Amazon is a garbage e-retailer. E-retailers have 1% margins, so that revenue sounds impressive but Amazon essentially makes no profit from any of it that came from selling things on Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:18:08'] The answer is they do this on purpose. They know the higher they push it, the more excited people will get which will then drive in even more FOMO. Eventually FOMO will go in overdrive maybe if NVDA reaches 500, 600 or even 700 and then they pull the rug and it goes down 80-90%. This game gets played over and over and people still fall for it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:08:42'] I think the options activity is playing a major role in the price movements nowadays.

When you buy calls, the MM selling that to you delta hedge and buy shares. As the price goes up, they keep buying to adjust. This is a vicious cycle with a positive feedback loop. Same thing happens with with buying puts and selling short.10 years ago, did you use to see 600B company going up 30% overnight? I don't think so. Now NVDA and TSLA and many more does that easily.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 03:06:53'] A couple reasons imho.The first one is earnings growth can compress PE. Yeah, NVDA has a PE ratio currently of 200+. But Tesla at one point had a PE ratio of over 1000 and today sits closer to 80.If AI truly is a highly demanded field going forward, NVDA could actually grow earnings at 50%+ yearly, which is enough to compress PE over time and make it worth more than it is today. But that‚Äôs the question. Just like when TSLA was projected to grow at similar rates. TSLA ultimately slowed down when the stock came down, but AI chips are a bigger deal and way more applicable to most tech companies then EVs were. Ultimately I think whether you think NVDA is a bubble or not depends highly on your view of what AI demand will be in the coming years. All it takes for a significant pullback in NVDA is one bad earnings where they report AI demand has slowed. Or a market pullback in tech in general.The other part of the equation is delta hedging from options selling. NVDA calls are expensive right now so MMs love to sell them. But if they‚Äôre selling 0.2-0.3 delta calls, they need to hedge by buying 20-30 shares, which obviously pushes the price higher when there are a lot of calls being sold. There‚Äôs 200k+ volume on NVDA calls expiring tomorrow alone

POST_TEXT: b'I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \n\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\n\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 22:26:04'] I have lost soooo much shorting NVDA over the last few months. A correction is clearly coming, but guessing when it will happen is a crap shoot. I don't know why they keep pumping so hard when they are clearly ridiculously over valued already. But fighting the trend has not been good for me, and  I don't suggest it. At this point, it feels like unless your willing to go very long on the DTE, you should wait for them to start to pull back before entertaining the idea of puts. At this point they are basically a meme stock.

Investors anticipate a massive disruption on an unprecedented scale, making current numbers irrelevant.It's not as irrational as people think. These investors believe that most of the world will run on AI in the next 10 years and that AI hardware will be a trillion-dollar market. If that turns out to be true, NVDA can even be considered undervalued right now.Even if you think it's a bubble, there's no reason to believe it will burst for the foreseeable future.

Timing it is difficult and going short is costly.Imo, it is up partly due to AI being a buzzword. Until that trend starts to weaken, it may not be a good idea to short.Do note that NVDA has not passed its ATH of around $330.The most I would consider is a small amount on OTM puts over a long period of time.Just my 2 cents

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:25:32'] Comparing the $780B valuation to their cash flow and capex costs isn‚Äôt the best way to look at this. NVDA‚Äôs value comes from deep market saturation and name recognition, partnership deals with large scale computer, car, and other tech companies, and from the fact that the AI boom is causing all valuations of semiconductor companies to go whacky. I wouldn‚Äôt risk shorting something that has this level of volatility and uncertainty.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 06:26:33'] So to give a more serious answer.Yes you can short NVDA, but there is no guarantee that it'll drop any time soon. You might be losing money on your shorts for a while. This is the thing about market timing. Yes, statistically you might be right, but that does not mean the market will follow suit.As with the 2008 housing crisis, some people were calling it about a year in advance. You need to have deep pockets to hold out that long. Same thing applies here. Yes, you are right, shorting it is objectively the best call, but it might take a while for the market to adjust. In the end, the market is a money-making tool for banks and investment firms. So NVDA will drop when a good alternative presents itself, since the money will be relocated to this alternative stock.

The market and media frenzy could drive the price per share up more and cause a short squeeze, where people are forced to sell all there stock and buy NVDA at a very high price per share to cover.If you want to place a bet, maybe buy puts and close at a profit if the NVDA price per share declines before the puts expire. If the NVDA price per share doubles or triples or more in a short squeeze, you'll only lose the money invested in the puts that could become worthless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:41:48'] You would short it after it loses a key support, retests, and fails so it means support -> resistance.So far we have been retesting supports and legging up. Thats not a sign to short.

Everyone knows its going to come back down to reality at some point but the issue is nobody knows when thats going to happen. For all we know this thing will hit a trillion dollar market cap before that happens. There is a lot of exuberance in tech stocks right now due to this AI mania.

Can you cover margin calls for that duration? Wait till you see the stock begin to crack‚Ä¶ fall below its 50 day MA on heavy volume for example‚Ä¶. Then consider buying a put option to short. Safer then buying stock short with less risk profile.

They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).\n\nThe bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isnt correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 10:59:06'] AI has existed in several products before ChatGPT came out. Alexa, Siri, Crowdstrike's cybersecurity platform, or Amazon and Google search. So while there is hype there are products already being monetized off it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:48:57'] Nvidia might very well see it's stock drop back down, but generative AI is not at all like crypto or the metaverse. Crypto is just a store of value that never really has had a clear usecaseThe metaverse is an empty buzzword that Zuckerberg pushed as part of a dumb and unrealistic plan that he failed to make happen in an attempt to become less beholden to Apple and GoogleGenerative AI on the other hand is a technology that already has many use cases with very clear and obvious benefits across a rapidly growing number of industries, with no obvious upper limit to where it can be applied.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 03:22:57'] I know this will probably fall on deaf ears. But this is different.  I get it looks just like all the silly buzz words.Fortune 500 companies are going to invest a fortune into turning their data into something that can be consumed by a LLM.Then the fortune 500 will spend a considerable amount of money doing the inference for the models.This is going to be huge and very, very big for Google, Microsoft and AWS.     But this is the easiest one to see.   But there will be plenty of other opportunity beyond GOOG, MSFT and AMZN.   They will just be more difficult to spot.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 10:46:53'] The difference is the meta verse was the meta verse and generative ai is generative AI. AI has countless applications and will be changing almost every industry I can think of over the next few years. It‚Äôs very much here to stay and can only get better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 14:52:28'] The fact the NVDA was apart of so many hypes(and actually contribute to those products and businesses) shows how powerful and versatile their chips are.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 02:23:06'] The stock has these swings in price quite often. Whenever the current hype cycle heats up / dies down investors can't decide if the company should be valued on its fundamentals or on the hype.I've argued for a while that it's massively overvalued which I think is a fairly uncontroversial view, but then again it's a one of a kind company with a very clear path for future growth. If you're willing to assume growth and profit margins remain robust then the current valuation probably makes some sense. If you believe that the growth may not be as strong as the market hopes it will be, or believe they will face more competition and lower profit margins in the future then the price becomes extremely hard to justify.That's kind of the issue with NVDA... The valuation can be whatever you want within a range of something like $80 - $250. That said, in my opinion at these levels there's limited upside and a lot of downside risk, but I'm always surprised how high prices can go when the market gets excited about things.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 01:05:57'] Lmao, literally noone on this sub knows anything. All comments at least regarding the peak are wrong.The primary reason for their valuation in fall 2021 was the metaverse hype. They shot up like crazy when Zuck announced that Meta is basically going all in on metaverse. Because it meant that they'd be supplying the chips. Also with Omniverse NVDA has a competent solution already for digital twins. This is the surge you see when it went from $208 to $330 within 1.5 months (8th of Oct to 19th of Nov).It helped that there was a general tech craze in the 2nd half of 2021 and that NVDA was generally doing well with selling A100s and 3000 series cards. But the actual craziness of the valuation came from the metaverse hype and NVDA being well positioned for it.And btw: The actual high was above $340, it was an intraday high that you're not gonna see on a chart showing daily prices only.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 21:33:08'] Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. &#x200B;*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*    *A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that‚Äôs been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald‚Äôs was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald‚Äôs could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with McDonald‚Äôs. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*    *And if McDonald‚Äôs was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot‚Äôs company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*    *If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you‚Äôd just be breaking even today.*    *I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: ‚ÄúDue to the recent bankruptcy, we‚Äôre removing this stock from our buy list.‚Äù In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I‚Äôve ever seen before or since.*    *You often hear about companies whose future performance is ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù in the stock price. If that‚Äôs the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*    *When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64‚Äîthough nowhere near as extreme as EDS‚Äôs. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It‚Äôs a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon‚Äôs earnings didn‚Äôt grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18‚Öù in 1974.*    *The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*    *The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14‚Öõ in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid‚Äôs p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*    *Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn‚Äôt have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*

TSLA has been overvalued as hell too and if you bought puts at $300 before it fell to $100 in January you'd be a genius, but shorts have lost an insane amount of money better against it on the way up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:24:08'] While I completely agree with your thesis that NVDA is way overvalued and due for a massive pullback if not a significant drop, you're putting a trade on before it's turned and you're fighting trend. It has so much downside that it's a far far better risk-reward proposition if you wait until it confirms its price has turned downward. Nobody here should be shorting in front of a tidal wave.

If you have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, they can tell you how bad the situation has become over the past few years. US investors are seriously underestimating the probability of China‚Äôs interference in Taiwan. It‚Äôs not a matter of if, it‚Äôs a matter of when. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre going to have a full-on invasion, they are going to be much more surgical than that. There will be a bold move they make soon and it will be a minsky moment where US investors assign a non-zero chance that TSMC could be at risk in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 07:58:42'] Couldn't agree more, my summary is below, the points are in more detail in this video [https://youtu.be/gtRU\_6mj4k4](https://youtu.be/gtRU_6mj4k4) &#x200B;To cut a long story short I think it's 50/50 for this quarter but that the next quarters are going to bring much softer results. Here's some bullet points of why:      Covid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.    AI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.    High Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.    Insider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.    If you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:24:12'] So I have learned my lesson on shorting or buying puts early. What you want to do is buy long exp put spreads, usually twice as long exp wise as you think you‚Äôll need. So for Nvda, buy put spreads expiring at least in July, if not September. That way you‚Äôll be protected from theta, and if the price runs, you can buy back the short and have more upside if your spirit has not been broken by that point. And If the stock does fall, you‚Äôll be able to sell for a gain.Another option is to short the stock while buying puts 5-10 strikes out of the money. You won‚Äôt net much but you‚Äôll be able to sleep at night if the stock runs up a bit

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:58:41'] Just some clarification:The reason I go for shorter-dated, far OTM puts is because timing is impossible for these kinds of shorts. Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.Whereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 19:34:14'] Until I see AI actually doing something in my life (which right now I do not see at all), it's all just hype. I drive a Tesla, and the one aspect of it that might be considered basic AI is the full self drive and it is utter garbage. I gotta disengage the thing constantly. I also use Amazon Alexa (not really AI, but who knows what's considered AI now), and it's incredibly limited in terms of what it can understand (most of the time it's obvious it doesn't really understand what I'm asking).So ya, until I see AI in my actual life, I consider the whole AI mania to be massive hype.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 09:26:20'] This is the buy high, sell low trap we all fall into. I have done the same in the past. Especially with tech stocks, they are always priced on future growth, so market cap is always high. It looks like some "news" of the future is driving the price way up now. At the end of the day we won't know exactly how the market will react, and we can only make educated guesses. What I have learned is if the stock looks overvalued to me, I ignore the FOMO and just stay out. Keep DCA into your index/mutual fund, and for single stocks only buy if it looks like a great deal, ie. as you mentioned Nvidia was down to $110 at one point, which was maybe a good time to buy and DCA. Right now it looks super expensive(more than 50% market  cap of amazon), but I can be wrong on this also.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 09:49:04'] It is way easier to stay invested if you are invested in index funds and DCA. Markets as a whole always recover over time. Individual stocks may not recover. I only hold a handful of Individual stocks and overall less than 15%. When I buy, decision is made if it is a "forever" hold or not. Tech and resource stocks are temp holds - don't have any ATM. IMHO, bear market is not over yet. I don't have to guess and don't care if I am right about it as I continue investing in index ETFs. It is a marathon, not a sprint.In summary, if you keep repeating same mistake, maybe Individual stocks are not for you. I am saying that based on personal experience. After many years of trading Individual stocks, I realized it is not working for me. If I was smart, I would have realized it much sooner.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 10:14:12'] Only invest in stocks you have strong knowledge of and conviction in. How can you really tell you have enough conviction to hold a single stock when it‚Äôs down? Experience. OP you tried it. You unfortunately failed. Next time you‚Äôll know better.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 10:37:45'] Looks like the lesson should be don‚Äôt buy overpriced stocks, not selling low.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 10:39:00'] I can tell an identical story about Tesla, but you know what? I bought other stocks that I felt more comfortable with and that has performed better/equally shit sooo.... ;)
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 10:58:41'] Buy low, sell high.  Buy low, sell high. This idea is beaten to death but people still listen to their emotions instead of logic. Unless you think the stock will never bounce back, why would you sell at a loss? Similarly, why wouldn't you sell your highest positions, if you hold more % of your portfolio in a certain stock than you want, for a profit? Last year I bought a lot more NVDA between $120-$150. Just recently sold all my positions over $190. My % gain is nice right now. If it drops back below $190 I'll buy more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 11:12:09'] Man, I was with you until the last word. Don‚Äôt sell because of valuation? Incredible how things have changed thanks to the endless money printing of the past decade. There is now a whole generation who doesn‚Äôt believe in valuation, just buy at any price. It‚Äôs been so long I under why you all think like this. Take it from me though, it will not last forever and there will come a time you painfully learn that valuation does in fact matter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 11:20:36'] i sold it all at 180 after buying it from 100 to 250.same with other stocks and i was right cause after that all went down. difference is that nvda and tsla doubled unlike the others. with tsla it was expected cause elon sold a lot, but nvda? i dont get the x2 and how amd isnt up the same.then i redid my dcf and i got it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:32:07'] i'm definitely no better but just different in my approach.  If i'm buying an individual stock because i think there's value then as it trends downward i continue to buy more and more and more.  Once it starts coming back up (2-3 month trend) i'll stop but I'm okay with buying into the losses.  Probably not good if you're buying companies that continue the downward trend but i'm buying general S&P 500 companies that almost everyone on reddit and their grandma are buying so i've yet to be screwed (still only 31 years old so lots of time for that!)I'm also a buy and hold type person. I have had to sell a few times in my life, (wifes wedding ring and downpayment on our house) but in general if i'm buying my goal is to hold for 10+ years. I still own NFLX shares I bought in 2011 as a junior in college with the few bucks i could scrounge up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 17:36:10'] My policy is never sell a high quality company unless the thesis changes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 18:22:55'] So I bought in to NVDA at 250 ish and as it dropped I panic sold around 200.  Part of a rebalancing strategy.  After thirty days I decided to buy in around 160 and DCA‚Äôd it to its bottom and rebuilt my position in NVDA.  Feels like the best move I ever made at least so far.  Todays move was crazy!  Somehow, I think it will get shorted and drop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 18:58:47'] I like you bought about a year ago. Sold it all today. I wonder if I was patient enough?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 19:11:16'] I sold as well about 170-180, but I had bought it around 90 a few years ago.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 09:32:31'] I don't think you are in any position to give anyone advice. If you think a stock losing 50% of its' "trading" price is horror,  then I am not sure how you going to react if the economy go through a recession, and you end up losing your job.Also, Nividia's earnings and outlook last year when you sold was actually better than their earnings and outlook today, so I am not sure what are you even talking about with the bla bla bla non-sense. If you read their earnings report yesterday, which I doubt, and your conclusion was they are doing great, and they are not overpriced, then you are not really that bright either. Stocks go up and down. Thank you for the update
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:09:11'] Never sell until it's over what you pay for.  I hold stock for years and years before selling.  The controverisal stock Akron, I think it is,  I forget.  I bought at 30 cents, did nothing for a while, one day for a split second it went to 60 cents, sold quickly.  Couldn't believe I made a profit off of it.  By the end of the day, it was back to 22 cents.  On a big company stock like yours, you need to fight the urge to sell.  People who panic like you that sell lower than cost is when non panic people make a lot of money.  I bought a lot of stock when the SNP was 4,800. When it hit 3,600, people who panic sold sold sold.  I doubled down and bought what I could.  Now it is already past 4,000.  So, fight the urge, my friend, and you will do better.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:19:30'] Buying NVDA at $234 a year ago or even now is completly asinine. TESLA was the only stock in history to pull its shenangians succesfully, what makes you think NVDA too will be untethered from wordly logic?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 10:54:11'] I brought at $306 (stop laughing) and brought the dip at $233. Since then I thought I'll wait until I can reduce my losses and then sell with some dignity. Not far off doing that now ('only' 8% down on NVDA right now) but knowing my luck this would be a big mistake with AI using NVDA hardware, plus the deal with MS meaning that PC/Xbox games are coming to Geforce Now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 11:48:23'] It kind of sounds like that you didn't learn the actual lesson: by buying single stocks (and in particular volatile ones) it causes people to fall victim to their fear and greed.  Which means they buy high and sell low.  This issue will likely keep plaguing you even if you think you've "learned your lesson" from this time.This is why the most important thing is picking a strategy you can stick to.  Even if it is technically suboptimal, it will pay off better than the FOMO buying and fearful selling we are all prone to doing.  This is why things like DCA'ing into index funds or even a dividend growth strategy can work so well for people: they are psychologically easier to stick to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:04:37'] One thing I've learned to do, if I buy high like you have, that becomes a trading position if I believe in the stock long term.  If I was just trading, I get out.Before you buy, decide if you're investing or trading.  If you're investing, it means that first buy is your core position.  After that, you can trade into it again, or just leave only the investment.  I segment my funds into 60 investing, 40 trading.My investments got their asses kicked over the last year, but my trading positions have done just fine

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:26:18'] I sold my position today. I like the stock and the company but not just to that valuation. It is as high in every aspect as it ever was, plus revenue decline. Market may be irrational but I think a pullback will happen sooner or later. Even Tesla pulled back to 100

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 12:34:33'] I completely disagree. The point of investing in growth stocks is to make a profit. Holding onto forever only ever works if you have one the best companies in the world or dividends are being provided. You did damage control the stock is over priced and it‚Äôs current jump of $200 to $230 within a day, no less is market overreacting. Even the best lose money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 14:04:14'] I welcomed assignment at a $180 strike price. Rolling it would have better in retrospect; I couldn't really justify valuing the company much higher than that though. I figured the chances of the shares dropping back down to near $100 were far higher than it soaring above $230, especially given the Tesla like P/E ratio. My cost basis was $178 so at least I didn't "lose" on the transaction. I'm guessing the recent surge is almost all hype and shares will be below $200 again rather soon. I'd probably buy back in at $150. The company is solid, it just currently commands a premium over earnings that is laughable when compared to many of the other big names in tech.

Or lurkers including social/political issues into the mix when they're at best minor short term concerns. So on and so forth. Build conviction in stocks you have done your DD on and which have solid fundamentals/expected CAGR. Practice portfolio management/diversification and make sure you can handle the swings. I've owned Tesla for 5 years now. Bought at lower points, trimmed to keep it within my portfolio allocation, and bought the hell out of it at $105 on the recent FUD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 15:44:20'] I bought at 8$ sold at 45$. Watched it drop to 30s during April 2020 and didn't rebuy. Once it went back to 45 quickly I was too butthurt to rebuy since I basically would have to pay gain taxes to own the same amount. Then proceeded to watch it go to 100+. The opposite thing happened to me with SNAP I bought at 14 and it went up to 80 but I was too scared by my AMD situation. So didn't sell and it dropped all the way back to 10.So really only options are accept the amount you want off a stock and sell when it hits the price or just hold 5+ years and not even look at it's price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 20:23:16'] You want to be cheered up?  I made a worse play on NVDA.  I bought it in 2011 at like $12 a share.  I held onto it until the pandemic.  It fell, came back up some, and I sold.  Think at the time it was around $200.  It then kept going up to over $700 and split.  Because of the split me buying it in 2011 was like buying a share at $3.  Then selling at $50.    I'm usually a big buy and hold guy.  But I thought I should take some profits on NVDA and did.  I thought for sure it would go back down and I would be able to buy it back.  I didn't loose money on the deal, I made out like a bandit.  But I could have made five times as much if I held

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 00:38:59'] Well you chose to reduce risk, I don't think it was entirely wrong, only that you shouldn't have sold it all at once but done some dollar cost averaging for selling. To be honest the market is pumping irrationally lately as we see greed, but this is to be expected, it will happen in the opposite direction with fear too. In my opinion you will be able to buy lower in the coming years, but be sure to be patient this time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 04:31:08'] You did the right thing. NVDA is super overvalued - probably the most overvalued stocks out there. Keep in mind that its price popped post-earnings on extremely bad results.Only reason why NVDA is pumping is because of irrational "AI" money flowing into it and other "AI" stocks. This will fizzle out in a couple of years (similar to crypto).

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 05:23:49'] Now to make up for it, if you're still bullish and want NVDA long term, start selling puts at a strike you're willing to get assigned at and you can collect premium while you wait for the price to drop again

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 08:21:43'] >Yet another painful reminder that for long term investorsHope I don't offend you, but you mislabeled yourself as a long term investor. When you bought NVDA at $234 and a PE of \~70 you were a FOMO investor. The long term investors bought NVDA when it was sub $100 with a PE below 50. They probably sold when you started buying.>Don't sell because of macro concerns, hypothetical risks, or because of valuation.No, you should sell as a part of risk management for all of these reasons. You would've been better off just sitting in cash and buying NVDA when it crashed to 110 back in October 2022. Hint: that's when some long term/value investors likely re-entered positions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 09:05:11'] Valuation matters. Buying very high as well as not selling when a bubble develops are bad decisions, in my experience (of being on the wrong side). Stocks like NVDA and TSLA often trade on unbounded optimism about the future, and driven by momentum. If you're not a momentum trader, the valuation always catches up and you pay for lost opportunities (to sell, in particular).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 09:32:21'] I actually think it's not a lesson is selling, per se, but a lesson in investing in companies with such high valuations that you'd be compelled to sell on a fundamental aspect of the company temporarily rearing its head(i.e. semiconductor cyclicality).I'm long chips, very long chips, don't get me wrong. But I don't own NVDA because it's so expensive that any crack in the story will bring it down and feels to hard to understand how it should be valued.There are expensive stocks I own but they're not so expensive that I can't understand the risk. NVDA's risk is so high that it could jump 100% but it could also fall 60% and still look extremely overpriced even with a rosy outlook.NVDA is a lesson in valuation. To own a name like NVDA you need to KNOW (to the extent it's possible) the story and NVDA's path and execution. If you KNOW these, then you wouldn't be compelled to sell if you think it's undervalued compared to its future growth.

With all the fundamental and technical information, it is not possible to predict, but to react.But price volatility is so severe that it will drive anyone crazy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 02:01:28'] This post made me chuckle. Who would've thought that former chip giant INTC would have to be the "next" anything 20 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 02:27:24'] For me, Intel is the Nokia of semiconductors, the upper management was filled by business people which made some very bad technical decisions. Now the train has left the station, and they were left behind, it's too late to catch up as the competition has become very fierce. They lost the design edge to AMD and the production edge to TSMC.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:20:57'] I remember when people were counting out amd and nvidia when intel dominated, so I can‚Äôt really say intel is done for especially since intel is still in better shape than they were back then. Intel still is building out it fabs and I‚Äôm really curious to see their next gen chips and see how they expand on their gpu market. Also want to see how their foundry business will compete with tsm. We will find out over the next few years. I like intel here in the 20‚Äôs. But they have definitely dropped the ball in recent years. They are taking steps to turn the business back around but we won‚Äôt see the fruits of that labor at least for a few more years. At this point it‚Äôs more of a long term speculative play than a short term bet. If they can turn the business around yes they are very undervalued but if not it will just keep sinking. It‚Äôs a make or break moment for intel
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:43:45'] the way people feel about Intel now seems very similar to how everyone felt about Face/Meta last year
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:03:55'] If you want to take a risk, yes, investing in Intel has decent potential. However if you want to play it safe, I would wait til next earnings before buying in. Their last 2 earnings were awful and the CEO said both times that the worst is over.It's really up up to this quarter. The stock will either tank or jump up. Personally, I'm feeling bullish on Intel but it's a pure feeling play. If Intel were to turn things around, now is the time. If it isn't now, then it's never imo.and also to be clear, Intel might be a good investment, but no, it's not gonna be "the next NVDA"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:46:39'] They will never become the behemoth they once were, and will steadily lose market shares in the coming years. However, they will remain an important player in a more diverse ecosystem. They will play an important part in the American semi-conductor strategy (being heavily subsidized by the taxpayers to build foundries to ramp up domestic chip production).   They still build excellent CPUs that equip a large fraction of the laptops and the PCs sold worldwide, and their ARC GPU is apparently quite decent. Event better than a similarly priced NVIDIA GPU.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:50:20'] Intel missed the boat on AI, just like they missed the boat on mobile processors 10-15 years ago when the smartphone revolution happened. They are behind both Nvidia and AMD at this point (AMD has AI specific chips coming out in the 2nd half of this year).AI heavy workloads don't need much CPU processing - Intel's bread and butter. The more the future looks like AI the worse it is for Intel. AI chatbots eating away at search means Intel's TAM will shrink (at the very least growth that would've needed more CPU's will instead need more AI specific GPU's and custom silicon from Nvidia and AMD. At worst the market for server CPU's will shrink). And it benefits Intel's direct competitors in that CPU space, AMD/TSMC.

They are hemorrhaging money and even though their runway is decades out, fading to nothing is not exactly something I would want to invest in.That being said I bought 5 at like 26 because I'll be damned if I'm wrong and a train comes and leaves without at least my toes being on the train.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:38:19'] The insight that Nvidia is growing is because of data center or AI processors.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:05:14'] Intel has essentially become a speculative stock now. It‚Äôs fallen behind the competition and doesn‚Äôt currently bring much to the table. There is a chance they could quickly catch up. They recently cut their dividend (resulting in more money for the company) and the US government is pushing for more domestic chips. If you buy intel you‚Äôre basically betting the management can make some not terrible decisions, which has been a losing bet for the past 20 years. I think it‚Äôs worth a small portion of my portfolio. If you want to put on your tin foil hats, intel might get some of the China market. Intel has made some recent trips to China very close to the Micron ban. Keep in mind the timing could easily be a coincidence.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 23:21:06'] Tbh ratios can be misleading because it only looks at a company for one time period. Intrinsic value is found by determining the present value of the future cash flows of a business, which requires making assumptions based on an understanding of future business profits. There is more nuance than just looking for low PE ratios in investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:33:55'] Price/Sales makes more sense no? Earnings can take one-time hits (like acquisitions, e.g., AMD and Xilinx, or just cyclicality like in semiconductors). As a result you're getting some division by 0 extremes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 05:37:03'] If NVDA increased as much as apple from 1999 it would be a 175 trillion dollar company.So that would make NVDA 5x larger than the entire S&P. But NVDA is a core part of the S&P so they would grow together and the S&P could just be named the NVDA index because it is weighted on market cap. This is obviously a great idea and I wish you all the best on your 175 trillion dollar company that makes considerable less than 50b a year in revenue

From there, its course was more bullish, and your 1999 reference takes hold.NVDA has had ups *and* downs.  At this valuation, it's too much to buy. (I'm holding because... 50).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 18:28:54'] I've been holding NVDA all the way down and all the way up.I would not consider any opinions on reddit because redditors are biased by their hate for their too-expensive GPUs that they will only accept negative views on NVDA, at least until they drop their consumer GPU prices and they get into reddit's "good books" again. That's the actual reason reddit lost faith in the company.I remember when redditors used to bash Apple for their overpriced products, at least until most of them silently caved in and bought an iPhone while Apple became the most valuable company in the world despite the redditor hate.Redditors are probably hoping competitors like Intel and AMD can force Nvidia to lower their prices so they can buy Nvidia products.They're disingenuous when they point to Nvidia's declining financials as fundamentals when they know their long-term trajectory is growth because the crypto impact and drop from pandemic-level demand are one-off events. Therefore, using PE ratio is useless because it's distorted by the one-off events.There's zero doubt that computing power requirements are going to go WAY up from this low point, with AI and all. Nvidia will be a major beneficiary.

That being said once we get back to the lows I‚Äôd start thinking about buying again. AI could possibly be huge in the next decade or two. Out of all AI players I‚Äôd go with one like Nvidia solely because they would own both production of the parts needed (chips and semi conductors.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 15:32:15'] Why not ask the same thing about Tesla? Amazon?It's a growth stock. In October, the average thinking was that the incoming recession is going to be really bad. Now, the common thought is that the recession won't even happen, or it'll be extremely mild to the point where we won't even feel it.Therefore growth stocks climbed like crazy. If the recession turns out to be worse than assumed, then it will dramatically drop. On a company like Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, etc.. you're betting on the future growth of the company, and the company stock becomes much more valuable when future outlook doesn't look so grim.It's very different than say.. a company like AT&T, or Target. Yes investors care about future outlook too with these but it won't make or break the company. They are mostly out of their growth stage and are more stable than Nvidia.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 16:59:48'] Don't sell. Only way investing pays off is if you are consistently in the game. Buy quality and keep on buying automatically. The only reason you have been able to recover is because you didn't sell. Don't mess with what's working unless you are in your 70's and need the money right away. Remember it's not about timing the market, it's time in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 15:40:38'] I‚Äôd sell it, and wait to see what happens.You can always sell an OTM put to lower your cost basis.  The markets are being tested and tech stocks are not immune to this pending bear market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 14:43:15'] Its a bad idea, you are literally trying to time the market. If the reason you bought it at above 225 is still valid then it should be more valid now that its 225. There is no guarantees it will drop, or go up for that matter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 18:45:09'] It depends‚Ä¶on your beliefs about the economy in the future, your goals and time horizon etc.It‚Äôs a little too basic to say selling is market timing because compared to what? Sell higher than what you bought for is the goal in all investing/trading. At least break even if you can and find another opportunity.‚ÄúBuy it when it‚Äôs at $300? LOL LOL right? Brah high five LOL.‚Äù ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face) This is simple advice too. It depends.NVDA is a great company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 11:01:14'] If I had been holding NVDA with an avg price of $240, yes I would've sold today. Stocks are running on hopium and nothing else... NVDA's valuation is not even remotely close to reality/fair value. So what if it goes to $300? I believe that stocks are going to be MUCH cheaper at some point in 2023. If it's not a good deal then I don't want it... no matter the company.Let's say you love Audi and want to buy an S5... MSRP says $65kish, but let's say they are all going for $150k... but you can find a competitor for a more reasonable $70k... would you buy the $150k S5 that you know deep down is really worth $65k? or would you go and look at other cars that are still reasonably priced?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 18:21:52'] After hearing the guidance, Nvidia sounds like a winner, however the macro environment foretells another story. Today‚Äôs selling volume was heavy.  See that head and shoulders that has formed on the daily, you‚Äôll be running into a lot of supply.  If you‚Äôre in it for the long term, why not sell some out of the money calls, and possibly some even farther out of the money call spreads.  You can always turn those farther out of the money call spreads into iron condors if they start to possibly get tested.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 22:05:52'] Are you fine not holding any NVDA? If so then sure you could sell and buy back in lower if you get the opportunity and if not no biggie because you're fine not holding any. This way you won't FOMO and average up. I dont suspect you're fine with none though or you would have sold it all already since you think its overvalued. You probably want to hold at least some long term. If you're fine with say just 25 shares, then sell 37, if you're able to get back in lower then that's good and if not you can't. Personally though I am holding most of mine, sold a couple shares around 230 to put into other holdings, but didn't do any swing trades with it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 04:59:53'] If you want NVDA, buy when it runs in double digits. Patience! At that point, might as well nibble a bit in both.Your money is hard earned. Don't fomo in thinking long term. Why not get better entries?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 13:10:48'] AMD's current server products are expected to continue gaining market share from Intel, which drove their price to 160 last year. While the product they just announced at CES has a good chance of taking market share from nVidia. It integrates top of the line CPUs with GPUs almost as good as nVidia's in one excellent product with huge memory bandwidth. AMD is also a lot cheaper than nVidia right now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 13:41:05'] Nvidia is currently insanely overvalued and they are probably in a similar situation like Microsoft during the dotcom bubble. Their earnings are down, yet valuations are still very high. The company's products are great, but not the stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 12:29:11'] AMD is more diversified and is now big on enterprise and data center segment, they snapped up som great companies in Pensando and Xilinx, their chips is now used in Tesla cars, Samsung Phones, Steam Deck (also in Playstations and Xbox) and satellites, they are becoming much more than what they are usually known for (consumer pc and graphic cards) and let's not forget their super strong financial, amazing CEO and their venture into quantum computing technology.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 06:30:02'] You really have to dive into the balance sheets and long term outlooks if you want a fundamental response. Both stocks are very highly valued which means the growth in the stock will largely need to come from revenue/profit growth. It looks like both companies are set up to do that. If you want to make an AI play I would lean towards NVDA because they have products already on the market (A100) and deals already in place (ex Lockheed Martin). But just keep in mind there are many ways to play AI or even semis. I think NVDA or AMD could get hit hard if they don‚Äôt execute perfectly. For this reason I chose a supplier of Wager Manufacturing equipment. In this way I am playing the same space without taking the same risk (IMO). The company I am in trade at an attractive valuation to the market with a small dividend. Another way to mitigate risk is by buying the stock and selling CCs or CSPs against your position to generate income/lower cost basis. But don‚Äôt do this unless you know what you are doing. A credit spread can also achieve this. Best of luck!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 00:46:24'] This is gonna be lost in the late replies, but you should be aware of a major potential hit to amd stock price in the pipeline. They launched their flagship gpu the 7900 xtx with a critical design flaw that also affects third-party sellers of that gpu. They are currently downplaying this issue, but in reality, they are probably facing a major class action lawsuit or a total recall. It isn't readily apparent outside of enthusiasts yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if it dipped heavily once the news properly breaks. Might be a good idea to purchase after, but I sold my position (potentially prematurely). This launch also raises real questions about their internal QA as this was a real big miss (the cards overheat when mounted horizontally, ie normally, but operate just fine in vertical, like test rigs and mining rigs). It seems they just didn't test the card for average use case, which, to me, signals management are accountants/marketing and not engineers. If you're curious, just Google 7900 xtx + vapor chamber for corroborating info.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 12:11:07'] Nvda is my pick, but both are solid choices. Think Nvda has a few more potential breakout opportunities with ai, cars, digital twins etc. have a lot bigger R&D budget.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 16:48:13'] Amd is more diverse. Nvidia is more exposed to crypto winter and high gpu prices
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 18:02:29'] I know AMD better and think they have better profit potential short term. They're gaining ground in servers so that side of the business is healthy and growing. NVDA just seems too hard hit from GPU demand down in both consumer and mining segments. They'll bounce back hard if they can get current GPU prices to stick.. but that seems like a hard sell. $800+ for a GPU just feels bonkers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 17:33:24'] I will go against the grain and say it depends what your view point is. I think fabrication is really the bread and butter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 18:16:14'] Tsmc better
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 18:34:46'] I think the value of stocks will depend on whether or not the market sees semis growing in the short term. Nvidia's stock is priced much higher than AMD's stock. Nvidia needs to continue a growth story for the stock to continue to be valued high. AMD should gain market share this year against Intel so it will grow regardless of the industry.The biggest challenge for Nvidia is the new competition from Intel and AMD but that should take years to take a meaningful hit. AMD and Intel will win the biggest supercomputers while Nvidia will have everything else.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 21:21:41'] I expect the EPS of both to be weak in the next quarterly report. I expect there is more downside for both. There has been a report that TSMC had to drastically cut production orders for AAPL, AMD, and others. I like AMD, their server cpus are phenomenally better than Intel. The server compute space is headed more to graphics cards these days, and NVDA has been king for a long time. AMD is pushing out new products to synergize their server CPU + GPU offerings, but it is unclear just how things will shake out or when. My guess is AMD sometime in the next three months will see a leg down until its new processors (epyc genoa) hit full ramp, but even those are just half of revenue. if genoa does well but everything else continues to slump, their EPS will be weaker than previous forecasts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 21:25:39']  I do not dabble in discrete graphics. I do not own a GPU. I invest in AMD because I have a Ryzen 7 5700G APU. Integrated graphics. I am loyal to AMD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 22:09:34'] Please do your research properly, for now I would say AMD is better for now because GPU sales are at 20 year low, so there is no way Nvidia will have good results in the next few quarters, whereas AMD is into both CPU and GPU, so the impact of poor GPU demand wont affect them as bad as Nvidia I expect both to go down more in the short term, atleast in next 1 or 2 quarters

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 02:05:54'] It's tough. Aside from their gaming products, they both have a heavy push towards Data Science.They're both involved in numerous, similar, industries; Healthcare, defence, robotics etc.If you think about their prospects, and believe in the future of AI, with usage within smart cities, transport, healthcare, defence etc. I'd say both are very strong competitors.Their documentation on their respective strides in AI application is really interesting and doesn't really indicate that their glory days are behind them.It's not a black and white answer, and honestly, it might just be a better decision to buy a semiconductor ETF - if you don't understand their technologies well enough, but still believe in the future of AI, or even a split between the two.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 04:59:17'] AMD is consistently underestimated, this means it's chronically over sold, and dips every time nvda or Intel announce something with marketing claims they're gonna fail to deliver on though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 06:29:33'] I have followed NVIDIA the past 1,5 months, and noticed (which is to some degree ecpexted) that the more the subject "chip shortage" is present on different news sites, the more NVIDIA is present on news sites. Though, which again is expected, chip shortage is more expressed in the news then NVIDIA, but the volume highs and lows seem to follow each other. Again, it is hard to define precisely, but if you manage to stay close to news on chip shortage, I would pay close attention to whether it is good or bad chip news, and then follow the movements of NVIDIA and consider jumping in at the "right" time. Just a different view I though I would share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 08:56:39'] NVDA and AMD
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 09:07:55'] Why would you invest in either stock? Neither one is cheap and the industry has a bunch of headwind short term. What the fuck is with meme stock picks lately? Is this the new WSB?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 11:31:02'] ChatGPT has huge noise at this time. i think it will have some impact but its not going to take over anything at this point. cost per search is too expensive but its unreliable. I think once the dust settles down, companies wont be that aggressive buying up these GPUs. Plus on AI chips there will be competition. Not just from existing incumbents but from start ups making custom ASICs specifically for AI training/inference. Margins on these chips are so high that I expect Nvidia to not have it easy for sure. I dont think barrier of entry is that high as long as they support the right APIs/frameworks. In this high interest market and possible recession, valuation makes ZERO sense. Especially when their top line/earnings actually shrunk last year.

Their data center revenue growth using these two data points, was 55.7% per annum.Data center revenue in Q2 2018 was 19% of total revenues. In Q2 2023, it was 57% of revenues.5 years ago, you could claim Nvidia was primarily a gaming company, as most of their revenues came from gaming. Now their primary revenue source comes from data center. Another important point is that revenues to USA was 12% 5 years ago, now it's 30% (and their largest)So instead of selling to Asus, Gigabyte and MSI who sell Nvidia GPUs to gamers, they're now selling to US businesses.To answer whether they are buy or sell, we need to ask whether you believe in the story of the data center?The giants AWS, Azure and GCP are all growing at 30%+ even 40% YoY which means demand for data center requirements grow too.We need to estimate what their data center revenue might be in 5 years.At 30% each year for 5 years, we arrive at 56bn revenue per year. Apply 30% operating margin and you arrive at massive numbers (17bn op profit from data center)Of course, it all depends on what their growth will be. Their other segments still exist too, do we assign a $0 price tag on them?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 08:59:02'] Kind of in the same boat. Have NVDA at an average cost of $136 over the last couple years. Held it through everything , saw it blow past $300 and now back down. I‚Äôm inclined to just hold it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 10:14:04'] Why exit at 125 to enter at 100? Absolutely no guarantee it will go down to 100, or stop going down at 100 if it does. You sell a stock when you don‚Äôt want it anymore, not if you think it will go down 10%

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 10:07:22'] You seem a little late to the sell party. The price is down over 60% from ATH and just hit the 200 WMA and is oversold in the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 07:52:30'] I‚Äôm by no means an expert, but just as an additional data point as it relates to NVDA.The Etherium blockchain switched from ‚Äòproof-of-work‚Äô to a ‚Äòproof-of-stake‚Äô this week. This decreases the energy usage of the network by over 99%. Fun fact: the energy to run the network was about the same amount of energy used by the entire country of Chile.The decrease in energy use is because the switch to proof-of-stake means those massive banks of graphics cards are no longer required to mine ETH. I can‚Äôt help but think that this will impact the demand for those cards which we‚Äôve seen the last few years. I wonder wether the change in demand will have a significant impact on their top line. Noteably - this is likely priced in at this point; ‚ÄòThe Merge‚Äô has been widely known about for months now. Just worth noting it happened this week and was a success (so far) so is unlikely to be reversed. BTW - bitcoin isn‚Äôt (and likely will never as I understand it) switch away from proof-of-work, Edit: removed comment about BTC miners continuing to use GPUs - they use ASICs per comment below

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 07:45:44'] IMO Nvidia is gonna be the next Cisco: a great company whose stock peaked far too high and might never recover in a lifetime. look a the fundamentals, and Cisco is a fantastic company: no debt, crazy profitable, dominant position in its sector. but it peaked at some insane valuation like 150 p/e and $77/share in the dot-com bubble, then it quickly crashed. now, it's at about $40/share. it's never recovered from the dot com spike, anyone who bought at the peak is still underwater 22 years later. Nvidia is playing out very similar.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 09:14:33'] Nvidia is way to overvalued in a recession environment. Who the hell should buy a 1500 dollar GPU which sucks more energy than a microwave? I‚Äôm sure they will have to drop prices and even business customers will drop investment budgets. But when everything is over and economy keeps rising again it will be a future proof investment for sure. I can‚Äôt tell which price is okay, but I think it will go much lower in tandem with the economy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 20:52:20'] I think $125 is fair value for NVDA. Growth investors should buy in anticipation of 80% rise within the next 5 years. Defensive (Value) investors should wait for an 80% fall. If I owned NVDA, I would not sell. If I did not own NVDA, I would not buy. (This week I closed my short position). My current position is neutral.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 21:10:36'] I think conditions are poor for holding stocks in general, and the chances are good that you'll be able to buy most stocks for less at some future point, or even less than that at a different future point. But you might also wait a long time for the price of any particular issue to return to where it is today.What you're talking about is market timing on a scale that's very hard to win at.I'm in about 95% cash right now, but I don't consider that I'm timing the market. Rather, I'm out of the market because macro conditions are bad and getting worse. I'm starting to look for companies that might thrive as the global economy contracts, and I'm looking for signs that we might be in undervalued territory, or even the middle of fair value.That is, I buy and hold for about a decade at a time, and I get out when the whole economy signals big trouble. That is a scale of market timing that can work out.The scale you're talking about is speculation. You're not basing your sell point and buy point on fundamentals. At best, you're attempting short-term technical analysis that you haven't really studied. As worst, you are playing a hunch.You can make money playing hunches, but you are likely to lose money about about the same rate. I think you would be wise to examine what nameable criteria you use to decide what and when to buy.For nine years, it's been  easy to make gains. Conditions have changed. My advice: Get skeptical, get rigorous, and consider hard numbers before you buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 21:15:10'] I bought at 155, should have sold at 190 but got greedy and then it crashed and I ended up selling at 150 lol. If it goes down to 110 or less I will def buy again.

One of Nvidia's biggest partners, EVGA, just recently announced that they will no longer be making any Nvidia graphics cards. This is due to Nvidia apparently being terrible to work with.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 23:08:43'] Evga just announced that they are no longer partnering with nvidia due to nvidia undercutting their partners.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 01:40:33'] If you‚Äôre a true value investor and you believe in your stock then keep your shares. But ultimately when you‚Äôre 80% down and you look at your portfolio and it‚Äôs all red will you still call yourself an investor? Can you hold? It will eventually recover but you‚Äôre going to wait a long time. There is certainly generational wealth for the investor ‚Ä¶ but at the END of the fed‚Äôs inflation fight. I am no investor. In these periods of volatility I personally can‚Äôt hack it. My stop losses are set tight and I take profits quickly and immediately. I would wait for rotation of the market before reentering long positions. Even if you miss the bottom you want the trend to be positive. Use good trend analysis to your benefit.For everyone saying buy the dip - if the VIX pops and rotates the bull flag this dip could be much much worse for all risk assets. Every stock in the QQQ will be hit hard (the higher risk the harder) and NVDA is well within this bunch of assets. My advice if you are risk averse is to watch and react rather than buy because the price seems too good to be true (don‚Äôt fight the fed - they‚Äôre gonna pump interest rates at least until the end of the year - there isn‚Äôt going to be a ‚Äòsoft landing‚Äô).

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 09:18:43'] Not only is this a bad investment idea, it‚Äôs also bad for tax purposes because you could create a wash sale. When you sell a stock at a loss and buy back into it in less than 30 days you create a wash sale which means you can no longer declare those losses realized from the sale of the stock on your taxes. If you really believe in the long term future of NVDA, just continue to hold the stock and use dips in price to buy more shares and dollar cost average down. Buying and selling through short term swings is bad both for investing and tax purposes. Don‚Äôt try to predict what the short term swings are gonna be, I guarantee you won‚Äôt be good at it
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 09:58:36'] The future for NVDA is probably going to be the data center.

Discrete GPUs are going to be like sound cards in the late 90s where they just went away as the tech got better.NVDA still looks overpriced.  I might try to pick some up if it falls below $60.  AMD and Intel both look good where they are at Below $80 and $30.  AMD is killing Intel right now in the traditional PC space, but Intel is more interesting, as there is a larger picture going on there with the chip foundry now taking on outside customers and Mobileye's self driving cars, and Sierra Forest the E-core only server chip.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 12:50:00'] I'm a first time buyer as of today, for what that's worth. I'm not particularly happy with the company's valuation but some stocks command a premium. Nvidia is one, but we don't know what really even the ballpark premium should be so I decided to open a small position now and wait to see what happens.Anyway, everyone in every space that talks about stocks is negative, sure that we'll shortly be re-testing the lows or breaking through them. That makes me think some counterintuitive buying might be in order.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 07:30:56'] I bought so many shares on the dip. This report was absolutely expected and it's not about gaming, it's about crypto. They sold way less GPU for the gaming market because these unused GPU that served the crypto mining business were re-sold on secondary markets to gamers.Once the crypto crisis end (which btw was caused by the FED hiking rates so it won't last much longer), there is gonna be a huge increase in GPU demand. This is all temporary, nothing wrong at all with Nvidia business which is extremely strong and they are at the forefront of the AI revolution. Moreover with inflation at almost 10% the real stock price of Nvidia (in last year term) is 10% less than it's quoted today...so if it's 180$ now it's equal to roughly 162$/share last year.This is a company that I'll never sell for 10 years.

These headwinds were kind of obvious and even after this drop the stock is still trading at a very high valuation.NVDA sold off over 50% in 2018 during QT and the "crypto hangover". As a casual observer the macro for NVDA seems worse this time, but even after this recent drop NVDA has only gotten back to peak 2018 multiples. Back then it bottomed out with a PE in the low 20s, today it's trading with a 50 PE.I get why people like the stock and I've owned it a number of times over the last few years, but I can't bring myself to buy it at the moment. I might be wrong, but I still think there's a good chance this stock will be trading in the low $100s at some point over the next 12 months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 12:56:53'] NVDA was consistently one of my best performers over the last 2 years. So yes, it's disconcerting to see it 12% in the red.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 15:58:57'] I sold years ago but this is very similar to last crypto bull cycle when I did have NVDA. Crypto had crashed, a few months later Nvidia profits cratered and it took another year for it to turn around. They have their fingers in a few pies, datacenter, AI, advanced display technology, automated driving, computer vision, etc. I've considered getting back in if it keeps dropping.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 20:40:37'] I have not looked at Nvidia in a while, so idk specifics about the balance sheet or price ATM, but today's presentation made one thing perfectly clear. Nvidia doesn't want to be a GPU company anymore, they want to be an AI company. The gaming GPUs were a blip in the entire presentation. Honestly they spent more time saying "sign up for our new managed AI service starting in q4" than they spent talking about the consumer GPU. Imo it comes down to how profitable do you believe managed AI service and the "omniverse" will be over the next 1-3 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 17:00:54'] This post is an indication to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 15:44:17'] I read through the financials of NVDA and this is why I'm bearish on NVDA:1. Flat Revenue growth YoY (3% growth from Aug 21). Declining Revenue growth Quarter over quarter. It went from 8.3B to 6.7B in the last earnings release. 2. Spiking cost of revenue. This was 2.3B Aug 21. It's now at 3.8B in the last earnings. It's also increasing quarter over quarter. 3. This leads to a huge decline to gross profit. 4.2B a year ago to 2.9B today. Same picture with Quarter over Quarter. 4. Operating expenses have also ballooned. 1.8B a year ago to 2.4B today. This means they posted only 500M of operating income, compared to 2.5B a year ago.5. NVDA announced that their Q3 outlook is only 5.9B in revenue. That's another quarter of steep decline. I doubt they'll be able to reduce cost fast enough to keep up. I would expect them to lose money next quarter. BTW - I don't believe this estimate was done after the executive order to stop supplying China with their chips.6. The PE as of today's closing price is around 40. For a company to be worth 40 PE, you need to show 25%+ revenue growth IMO. So you need to see 9.5B. I am not hopeful that they can go from 5.9B next quarter to 9.5B by end of 2023. A company with <5% Revenue growth (and decelerating) and quickly eroding margin does not deserve 40PE. I would expect it to be around 13x-15x PE. So based on this analysis, I would think a fair market value for NVDA is around $60. Another 55%-60% decrease in price.

Unfortunately, great company does not equal great stockIt was the perfect company for the high QE/low interest rate environment. That's what concerns me. The conditions that fueled NVDAs growth no longer exist. They will have a tough time going forward and I wouldn't be surprised if they dont see that old ATH for years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 12:52:44'] It is very common for investors to view a decline in multiple as a sign that the business is somehow becoming impaired. This can certainly be the case, but not for NVDA. The issue is that the multiple just became completely unsustainable given the company's size. Growth rates MUST fall as the business gets bigger. in 2019, NVDA traded at 7x sales with a mkt cap of $100B. Then it went to 20x sales with a mkt cap of $500B. Sales almost tripled in that time. Now NVDA is one of the largest semi conductor companies in the world and growth has to slow. This is a textbook example of the fact that you MUST be mindful of valuation for even the best companies in the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 05:46:33'] For my money AMD is the better pick @ $75 (fwd PE @ 17, PEG @ 0.6). Better management, better ROIC, better protection from macro headwinds (datacentre + Xilinx/Pensando + increasing TAM) = faster and cheaper growth. Yes semis are cyclical but this is reducing and the market is forward looking. Historically the stock price will bottom at least two quarters before the next cycle begins. DCAing into semis now over the next six months is probably a good option.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 08:21:42'] Hmm... "losing confidence in NVDA?" NVDA is down over 50%, so do U need more proof?**Can chip giant NVIDIA shrug off China sales ban?*****The share price for chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA) has fallen more than 53% year-to-date***Analysts have reduced their price targets after the company revised down its earnings outlook in August, and the US government-imposed restrictions on NVIDIA selling chips to China and Russia.*Is now a good time to trade the stock?***History of NVIDIA**NVIDIA was founded in the US in 1993 by electrical engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Huang currently serves as the company‚Äôs CEO, Malachowsky remains a senior executive and Priem retired from the company in 2003.NVIDIA invented the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in 1999, a high-performance processor that generates interactive graphics for virtual reality, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI).NVIDIA reported its first $1bn-revenue quarter in 2007 and shipped its 1 billionth graphics processor in 2011.In September 2020, the company announced plans to acquire UK chip designer Arm from Japanese investment firm SoftBank (9984) for $40bn. However, the deal collapsed under opposition from UK regulatory authorities, with NVIDIA announcing the termination of the transaction on 7 February 2022.On 6 May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed a $5.5m settlement with NVIDIA over the company‚Äôs failure to disclose in 2018 that cryptocurrency mining was a significant source of revenues from sales of its GPUs designed for gaming.NVIDIA stock slumps on as trade war compounds slowdownBased on NVDA stock historical prices, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $334.12 on 29 November 2021, with lockdowns around the world increasing demand for computing and entertainment systems. The stock had been trading around $51 in March 2020 at the start of pandemic-related restrictions.The share price began to retreat as technology stocks sold-off heading into 2022. NVDA started the year at $301.21 a share and dropped to $219.44 on 27 January. It rebounded to $267.05 on 9 February and $286.56 on 29 March, but began to fall sharply in April as analysts started to downgrade the stock on signs of slowing consumer demand for GPUs and concerns about the impact of high inflation.Technology stocks have borne the brunt of stock market selloffs, as central banks, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed), have begun aggressively raising interest rates and some investors have shifted from stocks to fixed-income assets.The NVDA share price fell to the $161 level in May and despite an uptick to $195.92 in June, continued to decline, reaching $145.23 on 1 July. The stock rose to $192.15 on 4 August, but was unable to hold at that level.On 24 August, NVIDIA reported revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended 31 July of $6.7bn, up 3% from the same period in 2021, but down 19% from the previous quarter. Earnings per share fell to $0.26, down by 72% from a year earlier and 59% lower than the previous quarter.Jensen Huang said:‚ÄúWe are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.‚ÄùThe share price rose from $171.81 on 23 August to $179.13 on 25 August, but at least 14 Wall Street analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock on 25 August amid expectations of lower projected growth, weighing on the share price as investors sold the stock in response. The share price ended the month at $150.94.NVDA dropped to $139.37 on 1 September in response to an SEC filing that the US government had informed the company on 26 August of a new license requirement for exports to China and Russia for the company‚Äôs A100 and H100 integrated circuits and any products that incorporate them.The government indicated that the license is intended to ‚Äúaddress the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a ‚Äòmilitary end use‚Äô or ‚Äòmilitary end user‚Äô in China and Russia.‚ÄùNVIDIA said that it ‚Äúdoes not sell products to customers in Russia,‚Äù but ‚Äúthe new license requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete its development of H100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of A100 and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China.‚ÄùBased on the outlook NVIDIA provided for its third fiscal quarter in its results on 24 August, approximately $400m in potential sales to China could be subject to the new license requirement, the company said in the filing.The NVDA share price subsequently dropped to $134.65 on 6 September, its lowest level since March 2021. The stock then ticked higher to close at $139.90 on 8 September.What is the outlook for the NVIDIA share price after the selloff? Can it rebound or will it remain under pressure? Let‚Äôs look at some future predictions from analysts.Several Wall Street analysts downgraded their stock expectations in response to the US government‚Äôs licensing requirements.Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein lowered their price target to $180 from $210 on 1 September. On 2 September, Daiwa Capital Markets reduced its target to $133 from $215, downgrading the stock from outperform to neutral, while Needham & Company lowered its stock projection to $170 from $185.Analysts at Deutsche Bank declined to provide a forecast until there are more details available, noting:‚ÄúAt a time when demand uncertainties are already rising across the semi sector, and rapidly expanding from Consumer markets to the Data Center, we expect these new trade restrictions to add additional investor angst regarding chip demand/growth prospects. We expect the impact on NVDA to be largest amongst the US processor companies, given the company‚Äôs leadership position in HPC/AI.‚ÄùWhen evaluating any NVIDIA stock 5-year forecast, you should keep in mind that analysts‚Äô forecasts can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn‚Äôt be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before investing. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 08:22:37'] Well, NVDA is almost 60% down from its peak. However, I still have confidence in it.I've found this video "Nvidia: The Most Powerful Company On Earth?

At what price, are you willing to get in? Tech sec as a whole is down so its not just NVDA therefore I am not too concerned. My question is whats the fair price that everyones thinking? Any thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 20:13:47'] **I still believe in the long term $NVDA story.**  These are the negatives that will create an opportunity to buy on declines.**($120 to $150)**  1)The lack of Ethereum mining pounds GPU's used for mining - that market is gone  2) A crypto winter ensures used GPU cards being returned to the market, which will lead to sinking ASP's.  3) Gaming inventory will take at least 2-3 quarters to clear.  As a result, NVDA's FY Jan 2023 EPS will be closer to $3.5, a huge drop over FY 2022.  **Why am I buying on declines?*** The long term growth story is still intact; owning this stock for the next 3-5 years will pay off very well.* Data Data growth will remain strong - Data center overtook gaming for the 1st time in 2022 and should grow 53% YoY to $16.3Bn for FY Jan 2023, as Gaming drops 38% to $7.8Bn.* As NVIDA clears out its bloated gaming inventory over the next 2 quarters, I except decent in gaming as well in FY 24 and FY 25, especially on what is now a lower base.* NVIDIA's CUDA software is a big competitive advantage and allows it to price its hardware much higher than competitors.* The introduction of Hopper, besides additional revenues from its Mellanox acquisition will also contribute to revenues* NVDA also has an 11Bn auto pipeline over the next 5 years  My revenue estimates for the next 2 years are as under.  All numbers are in $Bn.  |Segment	|FY Jan 2024|Growth|FY Jan 2025|Growth||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-||Gaming	|7.01|(9)%|8.5|20%||Data Center|22.1|36%|29.9|35%||Auto, Pro-Viz & Other|  3.9|13%|4.9|25%||Total|33.2|20%|43.3|31%||EPS|5|43%|6.5|30%|			  I'll start accumulating in 20% increments below $150; given current market conditions after Powell's hawkish speech, the stock could tank to $120.  At an estimated average cost of $135, I'm looking for a 2 year target of 33 times Jan 25 earnings of $6.5 = $215 or about 60% higher.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 21:51:02'] I buy every paycheck. I worry everyday that this company will put me out of a job. So I will keep investing in it like crazy as a hedge
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 16:27:34'] Below $150 is good to grab a couple of shares but I wouldn‚Äôt grab too much. Below $130 is where I would start buying heavily, below $100 is put all your money in it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 10:51:50'] I would hold off until we see what direction this market is going. If we go into a deep plunge everything‚Äôs gonna be affected even more so. I wouldn‚Äôt get into a specific individual stock like this unless that happened.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 16:07:48'] People will say it‚Äôs down 50% on the year so buy now. If you actually read their last earnings report you could see why it probably deserves to be down 70%. Not kidding
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 14:47:17'] I‚Äôll give you my shares at 267, it‚Äôs a great deal bruv
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 11:21:54'] Inventories seem very bloated at this point, also given the cyclical nature of semis to seemingly have caught up with the industry i think the next year will be a rough ride. So i'd prefer it to come down significantly more before making an entry. At current point i see no reason why NVDA should trade at a far higher valuation multiple than AMD. For me, either the price drops to a 80-90 range or their growth stabilizes around 50-60% in which case i would gladly buy here.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 18:08:46'] I‚Äôd say probably about half of what it is trading at right now or at the very most, $110-$110 per share.  Nvidia enjoyed the big run up from the pandemic with gaming booming but not sure they‚Äôll demand like that again for awhile.  It is still so expensive relative to the market and earnings expectations for coming quarters are expected to be over 30% lower YoY.  I‚Äôd look at cheaper chip companies like MU and QCOM if you want to get into a chipmaker.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 14:14:12'] P/e ratio of 20 would be a nice start
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 10:50:03'] I just keep buying, but I am in it for the long haul. IMO there is tremendous upside to NVIDIA over the next decade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 17:09:54'] It's a $100 stock imo, and that might be a bit generous. I've said I'd probably buy it in the low $100s before, but I'm not sure anymore. There last earnings miss was ridiculous and in my experience not the kind of miss that turns around after a quarter or two.I get why people like the company, but given its poor performance as of late and it's excessive valuation I don't think there's any rush to buy right now. Unless it drops like 50% I'll probably just wait a few months before considering a position. If early next year it's trading sub-$100 then that would probably be a decent entry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 16:48:36'] Well I would like to buy it at PE 20 or below. It will never happen, but honestly I would buy at 75.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 19:15:25'] $60-$90 is the range that would be pretty tempting to buy in, 20-30 p/e range. While there was a shortage they jacked up their prices and they made bank but now with a recession on the horizon they are going to have to cut prices. The "gaming" sector seems to be in crisis with multiple crypto currencies crashing and it doesn't look like there will be much relief for a while with more regulations on the horizon. So I am not sure if there is much of a case for the current high multiple.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 11:16:33'] YTD is almost down 50%.I have been buying now.  Maybe buy 25% of what you want to invest in now and continue every month.  No one knows what the future holds.  Russia nukes or ends war in Ukraine could make big differences.China could steer their ship either way could changes things.US inflation could swing things as well.Next 3 months will give a good indicator for the next 1 to 2 years.  I buy and hold generally, so the small waves don't matter to me.  I have around 40k$ of dividend reinvested and another 100k$ annual purchases I make throughout the year.  In 5 to 10 years I know I will be happy with NVDA current prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 10:50:10'] I think in the 120s (though I‚Äôll probably fomo a little starting in the 130s). But I also don‚Äôt actually expect the price to drop that low since the stock is fundamentally disconnected from the company‚Äôs performance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 11:05:55'] Im not a semi guy but these hardware names are pretty cyclical. Given that we are in the down part of the cycle I would be on the sidelines until things become very dire. Maybe this is the trough of the cycle but something tells me we have more to go. A 75% sell off from peak highs isn't unusual so $70 -$90 might be a good place to start looking at.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 10:52:21'] **There is no such thing as a consensus for future price changes.**  I am seeing this word posted on this sub daily.  The market ***is*** the consensus about value.I'm not sure the fact that the entire tech sector is down should make you feel better.  I don't follow this stock closely enough to really put a personal price target on it, but I think its prior valuation was a bit pie-in-the-sky.

After crypto crash, nvda doesnt have the love....at least not from bagholders who are increasingly desperate to sell on any rallies which then push the price down. Over the next 2-3 weeks the technicals seem to point down, at least until we get to mid 140's where it might stabilize. After that is anyone's guess.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 21:45:28'] I bought 25 shares back in 2018. So holding 100 now after the split. Don‚Äôt really care about the share price, I‚Äôll be holding for the rest of my life unless something changes, but the simple truth is noone does what Nvidia does. And the entry barrier is extreme. Just think of it - they are the only one with access to next gen GPU:s so they will always be one step ahead in AI development. I guess AMD could pose a challenge but competition won‚Äôt hurt. Id be interested in increasing my position around $100. I think its a price at ‚Äùfair value‚Äù with a small premium given the circumstances in the economy. But if they enter another growth cycle my target is $moon

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-29 22:58:17'] This is still a little bit of a wait game if looking at indicators, but really, it's not far off from as cheap as it's been over the last couples years.The big problem right now is the used market.  There's a big influx of cheaper used video cards, a decrease of miners, and no 4000 series yet.  It's really hard to say how it's going to ride out.  Right now, I'd expect this to drop farther.The bigger negative is how low they may go with crypto cutting back.  Years ago, Nvidia was around a $2B to $3B revenue rate.  The crypto boom more than doubled that.  The biggest harm now is falling back down to that $3B level, halving their prime just a short bit ago.  They also cut dividends too which didn't help.I'd expect some rise from 4000 series release, but if their sales cut in half, I can't see the stock holding price, not even a "low" one of this peak time.  They're going to settle over the next year or two.

If you do not then I really do not think any price would make any difference.So to me there are two questions.  Do you believe in NVDA long term?  If yes at what price would you enter or increase position?For me I believe chips will more and more come from the big guys.   Take Google.  They are already making their own server AI chips and suppose to be excellent.https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsBut not just AI chips but now doing their own for their phones and rumored to also be tablets and laptops in the future.Also other examples like networking and videohttps://www.protocol.com/enterprise/youtube-custom-chips-argos-asicsApple does their own chips for mobile and tablets and now laptops.  Not on the backend yet.  Tesla doing their own now for AI with the DOJO.   Amazon has started to do their own.  This trend has barely even got started and should continue, IMHO.The world has changed.  We now have these mega tech companies that have the resources to do their own chips instead of relying on others.I think the better investment is in the FAB providers and equipment for the FAB providers.  So companies like ASML and TSMC.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 03:33:31'] It's at a P/E of 51.81 right now so they'd have to about half in price (\~$80) with similar earnings for it to be a truly good deal. Maybe I would buy it at $100. Beyond that it's about how you anticipate their potential for growth in the coming years. I think just about everyone will agree it's overpriced right now and the potential for extreme growth gains is long gone for now. As much as I believe it's a good company, I don't want to get into a speculative bubble and feel the correction with the rest of the bag holders.

Nvidia will make money while Meta will lose if Metaverse is not successful.Similar to how if corn üåΩ price goes up or not Nvidia is going to make money because they sell ASICS for corn üåΩ mining machines
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 19:39:04'] NVDA isnt getting broken up any time soon. Facebook has a lot of headwinds in terms of making money or gaining new users and they only stand to lose market share going forward. Semiconductor chips are definitely going to be in high demand for a while.Different categories of stock but I can definitely see why NVDA would be valued over FB rn. Facebook might be larger but they're a service company without much growth potential in the current term whereas I would say NVIDIA is a commodity company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 18:53:00'] ‚ÄúI know this sub is primarily focused on fundamentals and typically conservative‚Äù lmao what sub are you on because its definitely not this one if you think that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 21:04:30'] $FB has only been under $300 for 2 weeks now.  If you believe in the company the only price that matters is the price you buy and sell the stock for.  As long as you don't sell the price today doesn't matter.  The only price that matters is the price when you sell $FB. I am not a bull on the stock at all, but it is getting into the value valuation where boomer value investors will prolly start buying soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 19:05:07'] Seems the most common answer is fk FB cause they hate it for what it‚Äôs done. All I see is a company that prints over 5x the money of the other and not being constrained by hardware or physical limitations.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 23:50:24'] It shows how AMD is undervalued,
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 07:59:54'] A couple of things:1. I think FB is a buy right now.  I picked up 100 shares at its current price.  It may or may not go down a little bit more, but it's a buy at its current price.  I read yesterday that institutional ownership of the stock went from 51% on 1/31/22 to 80% as of 2/8/22.  I checked the sources, and it's true.  Big money bought the dip.  The PE is about 15.  I decided not to let myself get tricked into thinking the stock price makes sense at $224, so I bought.2. NVDA has a really good product.  The 2022 outlook for chips is that there is a near-infinite demand.  There is unique demand for NVDA chips.  It's priced at a high multiple because the market thinks that its recent past outperformance will continue for a few more years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 18:35:34'] Look at FB‚Äôs new valuation.The legislation that is being decided upon imposes regulations on the big tech companies‚Ä¶at or above a set valuation. That valuation is 600B.There is more at play here than what meets the eye.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 19:42:49'] Nvidia has outperformed, exceeded expectations for years and years.  They have the strange ability to innovate better and more often.  People pay a premium for that track record, right or wrong. I could see Facebook crashing big time in the next 10 years.  Are young kids really using Facebook ?  The people I know under 40 do not use Facebook. My older aunts and uncles use it to post pics of their life.  I would be embarrassed at this point to randomly start using Facebook and post on there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 04:03:14'] Wonder what FB user base numbers have done?  I stopped using them a few years ago due to them censoring things and overall leftist woke bull.  They just don‚Äôt get it. Won‚Äôt be going back. Reddit much better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 19:57:46'] 85% of iPhone users opted out of tracking which is huge. Then when Android introduces a similar option even more cell users will opt out. FB also faces stiff competition and is likely to lose the meta race to Google or Apple.Meanwhile, Nvda is the clear leader in their sector and all the previously mentioned companies utilize their hardware. Also, NVDAs addressable market in the business data center is estimated at $100 billion as the shift from CPUs to GPUs in data centers increases. Data center sales alone in Q4 were up 90%!I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong long term owning either. But due to the negative political and social viewpoint towards FB i believe we haven‚Äôt seen the bottom in FB yet. Therefore, I think I will stick with NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 19:55:39'] I think it‚Äôs cause FB just officially went from a growth stock to a no-growth/shrinking stock. Nvidia is still growing. People need hope when they‚Äôre buying a stock with P/E > 20. They want capital appreciation, not to wait decades to get their money back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 09:52:43'] I work in the tech business, and although I dont understand that much about financial markets I can give you my view from the tech side.Nvidia is the best company on what is probably the most important piece of hardware for years to come (gpu), they are investing in data centers and can offer better service then competitors already, they have the most effective AI tools and deep learning hardware, extremely advanced in autonomous driving hardware and software, the nvidia omniverse for testing and deeplearning has a market that we cant even grasp the size yet and is way more realistic and interasting than the consumer mataverse meme. The p/e racio is crazy yes, but nvidia is the n1 on too many hot markets with tremendous room to grow, with no need to prove its business model or profitability.FB is mainly an add and social media company, a market that in my opinion is hard to know how much more can grow, the consumer mataverse is a dreamy proposition. Sure oculus will grow a lot. But thats not a trillion dollar business..ever..In the end I would prefer having my money on nvidia, knowing it can fall 2/3 in a crisis, but be x10+ in 10-20 years in a business prespective.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 20:05:17'] The market values future income streams. Does anyone think, as it stands, $FB is more valuable in the future versus $NVDA?  Where does $FB‚Äôs growth come from? The stupid fucking Second Life metaverse?  Do kids still use $FB?  Can $FB survive with privacy changes to iOS?I see $FB as a slowly failing business, and suspect it‚Äôs future is more like AOL or MySpace.  I think the same is true for Twitter and Snap too, and social media in general is going to be a series of ‚Äúflash in the pan‚Äù companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 21:11:51'] FBs core business is under threat. They themselves acknowledged that. It's harder for them to serve relevant ads as the underlying OS start restricting data sharing. The meta verse is in a massive unknown and is going to be a huge cost center for many years before it can turn a profit. NVDA on the other hand has a thriving business right now. While they may be overvalued, saying that they cannot be bigger than Facebook is a bit much I think.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 21:22:35'] NVDA has multiple long term growth avenues, something that is difficult to find in other companies, and the growth rate is impressive given the company‚Äôs size. Also you‚Äôre completely on the wrong track if you think the company‚Äôs main current growth drivers have been the metaverse and self-driving.The management team matters, and Nvidia‚Äôs management team has excelled to the highest degree for the past decade. Investors pay a premium for that. FB meanwhile is going to spend billions of dollars over the next decade on something that we don‚Äôt know will even generate any meaningful revenue. If you believe in Zuck and the metaverse, then this is the time to buy. But personally, there‚Äôs too much going on with FB (regulatory concerns and related issues) for me to bother investing in it at this point; I‚Äôd rather save the stress and invest elsewhere.Is FB cheap? Yes. Is Nvidia expensive? Also yes. But there are valid reasons for it, there‚Äôs more that goes into valuation than just PE.Edit: regarding your last point, Nvidia is getting the revenue for selling metaverse chips to FB regardless of whether the metaverse works out or not. FB, on the other hand, needs to actually have the metaverse work for them to earn any money. Big difference; FB inherits all the risk
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 23:03:34'] I don't like fb. We would all be better if without it
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 00:25:11'] Not too strange tbh. Nvidia is the future, Facebook is the past.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 20:19:30'] On a fundamental level, FB should be good over the long term and is a better investment than Nvidia. However, on a more theoretical side there is a problem. Across the world people are getting more serious about their privacy. Apple made some sweeping changes to privacy rules that weren‚Äôt even particularly extensive and Facebook lost billions in revenue. Privacy laws in the EU and USA are slowly tightening, further squeezing potential ad profit there.Facebook has gambled wildly on the MetaVerse to sub par results. Active participation is a complete guess and AR or advanced VR is years away if it will ever exist at all. They could very well be pumping money into a pit. Even if AR and advanced VR do become available, what‚Äôs to say it catches on? It‚Äôs way more different than most things change wise. Bigger jump from cellphone to smartphone by a lot. This an inherent risk and the metaverse is also being developed as an online reflection of reality‚Ä¶ not necessarily a good thing.The use of Facebook itself is becoming less popular. While people do still use it, not enough do to justify any kind of growth. Instagram is the final piece, which is going strong for now. But is it reasonable to say eventually even instagram will phase out? It seems to be a long term trend with social media that the old dies and is replaced by the new innovative one.All in all, I can justify a significant price increase in the short term, say 2-3 years. Beyond that, barring changes to their model as it is, they seem destined for a slow and agonizing death as they try to find a new way to innovate and continue to fail. In an even shorter term, price could be wild. Probably increases, but who knows really. Really long term, as in 5+ years, FB seems like a terrible buy. It‚Äôs blue chip consistent slow growth is over and it is not a ‚Äòretirement stock‚Äô.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 22:10:25'] Nvidia has long runway for growth while FB is gambling money on the Metaverse while being squeezed by the likes of Apple on privacy features that are cutting into very import ad revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 04:16:04'] I was always a bear for FB even when they skyrocketed. I invest based on out look. My personal reason I never invested in Facebook is because social media is constantly changing, so Facebook isn‚Äôt going to be the most popular thing years to come in my opinion. Look what happened to MySpace. Twitter would be dead if it weren‚Äôt for prostitutes on there, major companies, major CEO of companies, etc. TikTok is increasingly getting more popular and it caters to people looking for short and satisfying entertainment, and will be popular for awhile unless they do too many adverts which they started doing excessively recently. My whole point is social media is constantly changing, and I don‚Äôt see Facebook growing unless they change. There are major privacy issues on FB, and one of the major reason I stopped using Facebook. I can‚Äôt change my profile pic without it popping up on everyone‚Äôs feed (even when I delete the post it pops up on their feed), I can‚Äôt make a comment on a public post without that post being recommended to a mutual friend because of my comment, it just became extremely un-fun to use.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 04:42:30'] People like to see Zuckerberg falter. His company is big brother and he wants your money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 04:58:56'] It is not just the P/E ratio. Facebook growth stalled, their daily user volume actually was down last quarter. Total daily users were down as well. And they never mention anything about the millions of fake bot accounts of Facebook and Instagram etc. meanwhile NVDA is a company that is growing revenue and looks to be for a while, and growing earnings with it as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 05:01:34'] FB wasn't crushed solely because of the metaverse, or their investment in it. They were crushed because average daily users plummeted, their ad revenue was down, and they are facing stiff competition from TikTok, SNAP, and others. They also aren't able to gather as much data about users due to the new iOS restrictions, and it isn't unlikely that Android may follow suit at some point. Because of the competition FB faces, I think it is causing investors to remember the social media platforms that once had a monopoly that FB dethroned. These platforms come and go in cycles. FB has alienated a lot of its users due to censorship, fact-checking, and the overall big brother feel with the constant COVID messaging anytime someone mentions COVID in their post. I personally don't appreciate the "Take this survey about how you're feeling" message that appears from FB at the top of my feed nearly every time I sign in even though I have dismissed it. My health is none of FB's business. NVDA is much more than self-driving and metaverse. They are also considered to be at the cutting edge of supercomputer development, self-driving and AI are a part of that. They are also the most common chip used for Crypto mining computers, which play an integral role in server farms (including cloud). I would suggest looking into NVDA further to get the explanation you are looking for. TSLA and NVDA trade at high forward P/E like most other tech companies. Since you mentioned TSLA, they are more than a car company. They also have an insurance and finance arm, and they are using tech developed for the cars and translating that to other future uses. There is also an unquantifiable gain to be had once self-driving and their robotaxi program goes online. I don't think self-driving is as far away as you think.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 06:26:27'] Makes sense.   NVDA is mainly known for making and selling things you can touch, like old school crypto mining equipment.   FB sells the idea that you have friends.Both are overvalued.   Like a middle class American might spend $300 on NVDA products once every few years, and not spend anything on FB directly.As far as the metaverse, FB bought some goggles, and they might be nice, but you need to spend a near equal amount with NVDA  to make them work.As far as self driving cars, how much was Takata worth before they went boom?    How many hundreds of dollars of product did they have in each car at the time?   How many hundreds of dollars of product will NVDA have in each car?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 07:11:40'] Nvda has been growing a lot year over year for many years now without the metaverse and self driving even being something people have talked about.It's the market leader in graphics computing and high speed gpu's in a world that is getting more digital by the day, it has a strong brand and moat in a rapidly growing market, obviously that's worth a lot. Maybe hard to accurately put a price tag on but it's certainly a very valuable brand.Also there is so much demand for their products that you can't even get a hold of them.is it worth more than fb though, probably not right now, might be in 5-10 years though if fb starts losing market share and nvda keeps growing, remember the market is forward looking not backwards looking.  I do agree that the rally it went on in the fall was insane though, seems like fair value right now shouldn't really be above 200 but wtf do i know. I'm bullish on nvda as a company but the stock is trading at a premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 07:23:21'] All I can say is NVDA is worth the price until it‚Äôs not. Need proof? Just look at Meta. Will I buy either? Hell to the no, but I‚Äôm older and need to stay conservative in my investments. That happens when you‚Äôre more than halfway through your career.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:08:54'] Most people working at that level within a company are required to provide notice of intended sales. This is to avoid "insider trading" accusations. Any board member would be included in this, as well as the CEO and VPs, top executives, etc. So this is a non-story. He had good timing to be sure, but this isn't noteworthy at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:18:54'] Watching people defending this cause they bought into the hype is hilarious.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:21:44'] Good for him.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:45:36'] I would too.  This hype cycle is going to end soon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:50:43'] I would imagine that regular employees are cashing in vested RSU‚Äôs too. It is too good of an opportunity to pass up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 09:06:11'] Who cares, insiders sell at ATHs all the time. Doesn't mean it's bearish for the stock.Just use this information as a reminder to not FOMO. Maybe hold your nose and toe dip to get a small position in. Then watch for some buying opportunities. Risk management is important to not blow up your account.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 09:47:54'] Good move. And he will probably sell another 120k shares if it hits 500.

POST_TEXT: b"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).\r  \n\r  \nThe founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.\r  \n\r\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \nIt hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading s"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:25:09'] Sounds salty. Watch it go even higher now
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:54:00'] I mean..... it clearly is
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:28:44'] I‚Äôm not saying NVDA is not overpriced. It certainly appears to be. But so is the entire ARK portfolio. Also Tesla aims for $8-10 TRILLION in revenue by 2030‚Ä¶ so Tesla is going to 100x their revenue in 7 years. This woman must be high off her ass or something
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:38:25'] What exactly has Cathie Wood accomplished?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:36:23'] Everyone and their grandma was talking about how overpriced NVDA was, and after the rally everyone's shitting on Cathie in particular like they weren't parroting the same shit for months
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:51:18'] Cathie thought it was overpriced at a much lower price as well. She may very well be right this time. But she's not somebody you should listen to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:11:52'] Couldn‚Äôt she just pull up a spreadsheet. Make up some bullshit numbers. Plug in 50% growth for 10 years and set a price target of 2000 after buying it and call it a day? That‚Äôs how she hit with Tesla, her single successful stock.Valuation only matters to sane people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:34:02'] The time to sell is probably when she buys in
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:14:03'] NVDA may very well be overpriced. But we won't know for sure until we look back a few years from now.If you watch her CNBC interview, one of the reasons she gave was Tesla Dojo. LMAO. Her ‚Äúresearch‚Äù has little depth and is often misguided. I watch entertainers like Cathie Wood for fun. To understand AI market I follow real experts like Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI), who said and I quote ‚Äúit turned out that they make a lot more GPUs than TPUs [or specialized chips] so it's cheaper to train on GPUs.‚Äù Google has thousands of engineers working on software and hardware around their TPU. If anyone is going to take market share from Nvidia, it will be Google, not Tesla. Cathie is full of shit and talking her own book.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:02:29'] She calls out NVDA for being overpriced, which it probably is, but doesn‚Äôt call TSLA overpriced, which it clearly is. This just comes off as sour grapes and trying not to look like a clown for selling too early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:36:52'] I thought valuations didn't matter for companies changing the world and innovation. Weird!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:36'] She isn't wrong about it being over priced, doesn't mean demand won't keep it overpriced.  Didn't she sell her shares 3 months ago?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:13:39'] She not wrong, but that doesnt mean it wont still go higher to insane levels. Just like her favorite tesla. So in that sense, she kinda is wrongüòÖ
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:34:54'] Why is her opinion even discussed given how badly her fund has performed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:54:07'] >Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after looking at the stock price.FTFY
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:33:41'] Counter take: This is the one time she did good by her investors by reducing risk before an earnings. Sure it turned out to be wrong, but removing risk is never something that should be scoffed at or followed up with FOMO. Stocks at highs tend to be at most risk for correction if earnings do anything less than exceed. This is contrary to every other call she has made of keeping a high risk-on portfolio during high interest rate enviroment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:58'] Besides her missed bet she may be right with that one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:10'] First time she makes sense and being responsible with her clients money. Its okay to miss a rally. There will be 1000s of opportunities if AI is really the next revolution
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:57'] I'd short Nvidia but Cathie has not been right in years so I'll just stay out of this...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:36:57'] Not sure if people are just here to shit on Cathie, or if there's people out there that doesn't think this is a sky high price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:11:09'] "Woman who didn't get an invite says she didn't want to go anyway." &#x200B;Sounds like she missed out and is now trying to justify why she missed the boat and saying it wasn't her fault.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:04:25'] Cope
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:13:28'] Sounds like sour grapes to me.  She‚Äôs angling to bring the price down and then swoop in to take advantage.  Happens a lot
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:20:40'] I saw a stat on here the other day that really distills how insane it has gotten: after NVDA's earnings were released, their valuation jumped by basically the same amount as AMD's entire market cap... Of fucking course it's overbought!! Read that again people!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:17:01'] just an obvious attempt at restoring her credibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:30:19'] She is not wrong here with the word overpriced but that did not stop Tesla when that stock was overpriced. It still went up until it crashed like bitcoin etc. The power is in the memo or fomo investors. When they all get bored. It's short short short.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:57:35'] Sure. And what's her new Tesla target? is it 2000 unicorns ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:10:36'] She sounds like a redditor lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:22:16']   She would.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:40:18'] She lacks the humility to be an investor. Sad
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:04:40'] Sellers remorse.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:05:28'] she gets mocked and people will disregard that she said this, but she's right.look at how nvidia stacks up against the other trillion dollar companies in terms of revenues or earnings multiples.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:07:46'] Still a holding in the Ark Venture Fund for now

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:23:12'] Her entire fund and career was getting lucky on Tesla. Everything else has been wrong
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:27:08'] So did I, Im just salty tho.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:34:53'] She doesnt understand that soon there will be no more need for software because it will be learned. Nvidia is definitely overvalued (soon their competition will diminish them) but the future is in hardware. Software unlimited, and it's free now, hardware is expensive, because it s physical
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:37:01'] Good old Cathie, She missed the boat. Of course it is over priced for  her. She is trying to bring it down with this statement so she can buy and then say how under valued it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:05:22'] Not even the great Ark Invest research team could predict that Nvidia would guide $4 Billion higher in sales q2.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:05:45'] All she does is buy overpriced growth stocks that have never proven to be a good investment strategy lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:06:48'] Sold at 415. Missed the high point the last time it spiked and don't want to miss out again. Good luck to those invested still
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:08:43'] Are other fund managers similarly impulsive like this? or is cathie in the minority?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:06:49'] She‚Äôs got no conviction and is letting the rate hikes force her out of positions. She wouldn‚Äôt catch as much flack if she would simply hold her ground and only adjust holdings when the thesis changes.Her overall mantra is disruptive innovation. That shit is not going to happen in a matter of months. I can‚Äôt count how many times she‚Äôs been in and out of tech stocks like Palantir for example. Buy high, sell low is for a amateurs. Not worth the expense fee she‚Äôs charging.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 18:24:42'] She made a lot on NVDA and she's still making as some of her funds still hold it. You sell on the way up, not on the way down. The fact she sold early doesn't mean she lost money, she just didn't make more than she could have and that's just hindsight.

POST_TEXT: b'You never go broke taking profits but I feel like I missed out on a lot more profit if I had just waited one week or a couple of months to sell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 06:41:04'] Cathie is that you?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:52:35'] Well, if your biggest problem is that you made money, I know a lot of people who would happily trade problems with you.You're noticing the rallies you missed, but you're not noticing the declines you avoided. If you're consistently taking profits when. you sell, don't worry about maximizing, that's where you wind up losing everything. If you can't get over it, consider a formula where you sell x% when the gains are y%, so you're never fully divested. Reinvest profits if you see a subsequent dip, or funnel them into an index fund, so gradually, everything goes into the index fund.Or don't sell ever. Either way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 06:28:20'] Get off reddit.Profit is profit. There will always be the next one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 06:45:02'] This is basically asking "how do I get over a girl?" Accept that you can't go back and do things differently, take whatever lesson you can find from it and move on.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:42:32'] I bought ASML at 86 and sold at 92 in 2014/2015. It is now at 682. Two lessons I learned:  \- Do not sell based on day to day news. Try to buy and hold as long as your thesis holds regardless of news/sentiment.\- Don't attach your past experiences of a stock to the stock. I could have bought back in the years after I sold, at almost anytime. But to me it was a failure that I sold at 92, I could not take the time to  re-evaluate the stock and consider buying back in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 06:57:55'] Sounds like you need an investment strategy. You should have a reason for buying and selling, otherwise you‚Äôll end up making irrational decisions.Trailing stop losses are a very good tool imo for exactly the reason you describe

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:16:07'] I've had it happen before. I know how it feels. I bought TSLA in 2019 in the $200s. This was pre-split, so would be somewhere between $13-20 today. I sold for $400, thought it was a smart trade. Then it went on the biggest rally ever, if I held it could have been 2000% to the peak, even with the TSLA sell-off it's still up 1000% from 2019.I took it as a lesson. "Can't change the past. I'm never going to sell good performers again. How am I ever going to have life changing money by selling stocks before it could potentially become life changing?"Now I'm holding NVDA which is up 600%+. While I understand very well that 963bn market cap makes the potential for future gains lower, I'm staying on the ride until the very end - after we see all the events unfold related to AI.I've already thought of the possible futures:1. AI is actually hype. NVDA goes down 50%. My life doesn't change - I go to work to pay bills.2. AI becomes a necessary tool for all of life, like smartphones. NVDA is the leading beneficiary. Life changing money - early retirement.3. Same as 2 but NVDA is not the leading beneficiary. Other companies "win" the AI war. Well I'm holding other tech stocks so should still be fine, and I'm staying up to date with company releases so hopefully I won't miss whatever companies "win". Already have companies like ASML, AMD, MSFT Which I why 67% sell-offs don't bother me and why I don't take profits.If stocks go down or profits are small - it doesn't change my life - I'm still working. Only by holding these stocks all the way is there any life changing potential. Hope that makes sense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:01:15'] This is literally happening to you RIGHT NOW in the stock market, and you just don‚Äôt know which stock it is. Anytime someone says ‚Äúoh my god, I mis-timed this option / day trading opportunity‚Äù I always think, what a fallacious way to look at it‚Ä¶ you literally have the option to do the identical thing in the market right now. There is some option, some stock, some coin that is pumping ‚Äî and you‚Äôre ‚Äúmissing it‚Äù or ‚Äúmis-timing‚Äù it. Just because you owned a particular asset that had a recent run means you were a little closer to it, but the principle is the same. By not selling all of your worldly possessions and putting them into LEAP options out of the money on Google when it went public, means you missed out. None of us have a crystal ball, so no use in getting too wound up about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:27:00'] I bought a lot of AMD at 8 sold at high 40s right before covid and watched it drop to 30s thinking a was smart. Then it went back up to same price I sold. But I was too butthurt to re own the same amount but paying taxes on it. So I didn't buy anymore. Now it's 120. How do I cope? Well on the flip side I bought a lot of snap at 13. It went all the way to 80. But after watching what happened with amd I kept holding. Now it's like 10 so I lost money when I couldve sold at 80. So it can go both ways. They could have dumped beyond your buying point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:22:31'] Lol fuck  I bought NVDA in like December 2021 at like $304 a share, then it fucking tanked down to like a low of $112 a share, and I fucking held cause I didn't wanna be out all that money. I literally sold just the other day at like $300 a share to get back most of my money cause I figured fuck it, this stock is over valued as it is and I'm happy to just take the small hit. 2 HOURS LATER I CHECKED THE MARKET AND IT SPIKED 22%?!?!?!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 09:31:12'] Basically, you don't know why you bought it, why you are holding it, or what the stock is worth. You have no opinion and are relying on other random people to tell you or give you ideas about when to sell or buy. That's the quickest way to lose money in stocks...

You make money over time by limiting your risk, not by making bets that go sky highThe disclaimer on that last sentence may not apply to someone who bets it all properly and actually wins then stops. So if you're that unicorn, okay but for normal people who don't bet the farm, it's all about risk management.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:20:31'] It's a tough one to get over, and I still deal with it.

And I bet people often see the upward momentum and buy back in thinking they missed something others saw only to have it pull back eating into your earlier profit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:01:19'] I feel your pain.I left 25k on the table from Nvidia. I sold Nvidia a week too early, and could have had 25k more in gains. Then, I sold a small amount of AMD a single day too early. I sold Thursday, and then Friday it jumps like 9 bucks!So, right now, I'm pretty much getting in my own way by selling too early. Of course, it's impossible to precisely predict the future. You can't always know what's going to happen. So, you're going to have to take profits at some point, and sometimes we wait WAY too long to take profits, and then end up leaving a ridiculous amount of money on the table when the stock drops 40 percent and we know we could have sold it back then and been way better off for it.We try our best and sometimes we get boned in the you know what

No one gets hurt taking gains.   you don‚Äôt have to sell 100% of a position. Try selling 1/4 or 1/2 and then sit on your gain for a while.    Believe me, stocks ALWAYS come down and you can buy it back. Be patient, the big gains don‚Äôt usually come until after a few cycles

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:35:42'] Just know that in a few years it‚Äôll go back down because it‚Äôs stretched fundamentally. You guys always FOMO into and out of things.

Find something else.Then when the growth rate slows for ALL the companies mentioned, decide if you want to rebuy at better price relative to fundamental valuations.Or just post about ‚ÄúOo I would never buy NVDA at $300‚Äù in 2025 when it comes down from peak mania.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 07:48:55'] If you're selling at a 15-20% gain then you are trading. If your plan going into that trade is to sell at a certain price, and you do that, you have successfully executed your plan. There's no need to feel bad about that. You'll never buy at the bottom or sell at the top. If you are buying for long term, try to avoid hype. Buffett has never sold a stock because it got "overpriced" if he believes in it long term. Either way, make a plan going in and don't compromise on it unless you have to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:01:17'] You have to draw a line at some point. If you start beating yourself up over every investment you sell that appreciates in value afterwords you‚Äôll probably go insane. Selling at 15-25% is beating most people, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a bad move.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:04:18'] This literally happens to me all the time - especially when I ask my dad for advice. An example being Palantir which I had held since August 2022. As soon as I went back into profit by a couple percentage points a few weeks back my dad urged me to sell (which I did) even though I said it probably will go up by at least another 15% (which it has). So that was a stupid move and I lost out on a few hundred dollars of profit but oh well.Then, stupidly I bought AMD stock at $80 and sold at $91 a few weeks back whereas if I had held I would be up at least 40% but oh well that's life - at least I made a profit.The truth is we are all very bad at timing the market and the lesson I NEVER seem to learn is just HOLD long term instead of short term trading. I have probably made over ¬£10k ($12.3k in USD) in short term trading however if I had kept the majority of my stocks it no doubt would be a lot higher. This is one of the reasons I'm moving away from individual stocks and holding ETFs in a brokerage account (Vanguard) that isn't so impulsive to sell and holding long term for instance an ETF which tracks the S&P 500. I'm from the UK btw so mainly invest in VUSA now although I do also dabble in individual shares but that now takes up a much smaller percentage of my Net Worth. One good example of my market timing was selling AMD back in 2021 near its all time highs although that is a rare example of successfully timing the market (most of mine are failures of timing the market).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:53:50'] Usually when they go up crazy fast, they come back down.I bought Shopify years ago at 160 (presplit), it shot up 50% in just a few months, I took the profits.  It then exploded to over 10x what I had paid for it over the next couple of years, ouch.  Then it abruptly lost over 80% in about 6 months and I bought back in.  Believe the ride up will be slower this time but while I did miss out on huge gains, I know I wouldn't have stayed in it all the way, probably would've jumped off at 100% short term gain.  Another way to look at it is, what if I had waited until it was a little higher before I bought, but then held all the way, I would still be sitting at a loss right now instead of having years to make those profits work elsewhere.

Set rules for yourself so when they occur you just follow the rule. If you‚Äôre going to be emotional over your trades you‚Äôll inevitably underperform the market
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:16:21'] For every time you didn't hold and missed a rally there will be another time you sold and missed a collapse.I bought pltr when it opened at $10 and sold at $32.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:37:23'] Mostly stop trading. Find a good company. Wait for a buying opportunity or just dollar cost average in, and then hold basically forever.The one exception might be when it runs up to a ridiculous valuation. Then you might want to sell some or all. The art is trying to sell at the peak, and for that you have to be patient.But be scared when everyone is excited about the stock, and be greedy when everyone is disgusted with it.[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales)This is the old price to sales chart for Nvidia. In October 2022, it was 12. It dropped there from a high high of 26 in October of 2021. Chart shows currently 35. This stock is FOMOing, and selling out is not a terrible idea. Generally you want to wait for that price to sales to crest and flatten, maybe even wait for a little crash to confirm it has crested.You could say you sold too early. Just like the saying "Don't catch a falling knife." It works in the other direction too. You want to wait for a bottom before you buy. You want to wait for a top before you sell. Easier said than done though. You made money, so good on you!It can go higher than this. Money is rushing into anything AI right now, as the rest of the market languishes in reality. But I mean, you are paying $35 for $1 of revenue. This company has to grow at a monster pace for a long time to justify the current price. This is assuming AMD and others can't compete with AI chip designs, and I think that is a bad assumption. Good company, really pricey right now. Probably will go higher, but I am not getting in at this point, if that makes you feel any better. I don't much like timing momentum plays, which is what this has become. Good company, but weird time for the stock.So keep in mind that this batch of AI is not AGI, and not even close. This is going to be more like the revolution we had with Google search, where encyclopedias went to die. There will be changes. This isn't the singularity.Find good companies. Buy and hold until there is a real reason to sell. Understand that the whole AI space is a good place to make or lose a lot of money quickly. Invest in a way that lets you sleep at night.Good luck to you!

Create a portfolio allocation, use something like Passiv to auto-rebalance, keep your emotions out of it. What ifs will kill you, and lead you to make stupid decisions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:57:30'] Profit is profit. You could not have known where nvda was going. No one knew. It was the usual bears vs bull. Market doesn't make sense and there is no reason for the movements.  This explosion also makes no sense. 5% gain would make sense, but 25% gain?!? It's nonsense.  No one knew. I think bulls got lucky. It was a gamble. 11b revenue next quarter is too high. I think they will miss it and next quarter their price will correct. A lot of it was Jensen Huang saying AI a lot of times. We all saw Wendy's stock rally from saying AI. Jensen saw that and he took advantage and said AI to trigger the algorithm.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 11:57:44'] You don't. You accept the fact that you sold too early and you move on to the next trade. Either you have a real reason to get out or you don't (and made a mistake).

I bought two shares at $210 and am regretting not buying more- but the P/E is so high I was reluctant. I think being in the stock market means you will always have regrets and make mistakes. Part of it is that when you‚Äôre making decisions, there‚Äôs no crystal ball, but hindsight is 20/20.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:51:02'] I have DCA‚Äôd all of the stock in my portfolio.  I also sold stocks prematurely in panic mode early last year and realized that was a mistake and learned from it. I moved all the cash from sales into more favorable positions which have done well.  2022 taught me a lot about the trading strategy I like. DCA is the approach that pays off in the end and where bigger gains come to forition. I do put trailing stops behind big gains with tides of protecting profits with objective of getting back in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:51:39'] If the gains change your life in any meaningful way take them always. If not, hold. You cannot act with hindsight and therefore should disregard any feelings you have with hindsight. Make rules and follow them and ignore everything else.

That‚Äôs the short way to lose stuff because one can let bad decisions overwhelmingly shadow small profit taking. It depends on what you want. If you are investing then why taking the money out. Unless you have a number in mind there is no reason to hurt. Always think the opposite. Would you have gone short when you closed the positions? If yes then you did good despite what happened, if not then just take accountability. There is an abundance of opportunities in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:23:52'] Learn from it.I‚Äôve coined the term, Synthetic Price Failure (SPF).  The back side of almost all big moves on securities or ETF‚Äôs are proceeded by day over day falling volume AND price dropping more than before the last run up.  When you see this, it‚Äôs almost always a sure sign that institutions want you to sell and are attempting to drive price in a manor in which you become emotional about your trade.While the volume was dropping on 5/19-5/23, the price closed down 3.1% vs. just prior to the run up (5/8-5/12) it was down 2.8%.  This is an increasing price failure on a run up.  Had volume been increasing and price moving down (less than 2.8%), this would have been your queue to exit.Volume and price analysis dictates with falling volume and falling price, the next move should be bullish.  The closing candle on 5/24 was a hammer.  All the signs were there, but you were tricked into selling early due to the SPF.The key answer to your question is that feelings have no place in the market‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt cope with anything, you learn and you move on and get better.  Congrats on what you did make!

Sometimes it‚Äôs better to just buy and hold (he does that for centuries) but it‚Äôs always better to actually make money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 12:39:56'] My cost basis is $161 (been accumulating since past 2 years). For me nothing has changed since I started 2 years ago. I actually have very high respect for Jensen Huang and his team. Nvidia has been executing its strategy quite well these past 2 years and I don‚Äôt see any reason for me to believe otherwise. They continue to diversify their revenue streams and have been delivering well on that too. Point is, no one here can tell you how the stock will perform in the short term so if you‚Äôve high conviction, you can buy tiny recurring amounts to bring that $300 avg down. People will say it‚Äôs still overvalued but good companies are always overvalued. Good luck!

It might go down more, but this company is going to be pivotal in AI development that will change the world. If you want to sell it you can, but I think in 10 years you will be kicking yourself hard if you do. I am taking this opportunity to sell off my safe stocks and go heavy weighted in NVDIA and a couple of other tech companies. Maybe it isn‚Äôt the optimal play but I believe there is a much higher chance I will regret not doing it. This is the time to start being greedy when everyone thinks the economy is ending

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 04:52:26'] Some of the best low risk stocks are down 20%,  such as big tech.  Growth is selling off. Just make sure you are diversified and mix in some dividend stocks like KO.  Try not to have more than 10% of your portfolio in 1 stock.  Im buying NVDA based on their last earnings report.  83% revenue growth in data centers.  Data center revenue is now their largest segment over gaming, 3 years ago this segment wasn't even a major contributor to revenue.  Could it go lower? Yes, macro reasons could bring everything lower
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 09:19:29'] Great company, but insanely expensive, even after its drop this year. I sold out if it mid last year and wouldn‚Äôt touch it again until it loses another 30% at least. So much of its valuation is in future profits. With the discount rate screaming higher and a recession coming, I‚Äôm not paying the outrageous price the market is asking for it. Semis are highly cyclical. Another 50% drop by some time next year would not surprise me and only then would it be reaching something close to a reasonable value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 12:17:29'] it's a great company.. always has been. but the problem all along has been valuation. if you believe in the space, this might just be your time to start accumulating shares for the next bull run. that's what i'm doing. long 300 shares at 168 basis
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 13:53:15'] I'll take a starter at $120.00, very realistic we see that in the next months. It's not as grossly overvauled as it was, but it would still have >30% more downside if it's valued at the same forward EV/EBITDA or EV/FCF multiple as AMD. But likely both those names will drop further. The fundamental outlook for the correlated stocks like Logitech/Corsair are pretty ugly as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 12:46:03'] My friend if you are down 45% it means that the stock needs to grow 100% from this point to make back your money. The problem is we are not close to a bottom. Depending how much of your portfolio is invested there you should know if it's worth saving what's left and buy back cheaper or DCA into it for the next year. Don't worry on missing out on the recovery, stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 13:44:17'] >What do you think of the stock?top 10 by market cap globally but not even in the top 100 globally by earnings. crazy overvalued and trendy, not likely to recover within the next few years. if ever.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 01:40:22'] No matter how great a company is, fundamentals matter and valuation matters. Paying an obscene valuation and basically banking on the company staying as ridiculously overvalued as it performs is a dangerous game, one that way too many people are playing. You know, you don't see FB, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT trading at PEs of 50, 60, 80, 100, even though they are brilliant companies.As a company performs, it eventually matures. Naturally the P/E and other valuation metrics will come down and reflect that. Paying a P/E of 100 is basically saying "Yeah, I expect this company to grow 30, 35, 40%, and not just for one year but for years and years and years to come. Tell me, how realistic is that for NVDA? What were your expectations when buying it at a market cap of 700 or 800 billion dollar? That this was gonna be a 2T company in 5 years?And, again, value moderation. Let's say NVDA starts slowing down and people expect them to grow 15 to 20% annually (which is still stellar growth for a company this size of course). Eventually that will factor into the P/E and the people might only be willing to pay a 30 P/E (note that this is obviously very superficial since I'm only using P/E to illustrate). With the expected earnings for NVDA, that would amount to a share price of roughly 195 to 225 bucks in 2025/2026.If nothing else, I think that show to some extent that valuation matters even for brilliant companies that are here to stay and grow. Even at the absolute high end for analyst estimates that sort of P/E moderation, which would, in my opinion, be fair, the share price would be expected to be around around 260 to 270 in 2025/2026. So that would still amount to a -10% in 4-5 years if you bought at 300 and held on. Not a great performance, even though the company would be performing very well in that time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 20:01:39'] PE ratios are \~20 (AAPL), \~40 (AMD) and \~60 (NVDA). People will tell you AMD and NVDA are way overvalued. In a way they are, and certainly the PEs paint them as such, but if it were as simple as selling stocks above a certain PE and buying stocks below a certain PE we would all be rich.Do your own research, but I like AMD's prospects the most out of the three. I think it's a matter of when, not if, Congress passes a big, fat stimulus package for chip makers like INTC and AMD. AMD's recent acquisition of Pensando makes them more competitive with Intel, which makes more than just CPUs. Intel also makes WiFi/Bluetooth modules, SSDs, I think a few other things, though I believe they gave up on the cellular modems. Dr. Su pulled off an outstanding recovery when AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy circa 2016 and I have confidence that she is choosing acquisitions very carefully and purposefully. Apple has slowing iPhone sales to contend with. Their M1 SoC is neato but I am selling my M1 MacBook and buying a Surface Pro 8. Still too many growing pains for more than YouTube and Office. A lot of software engineers/companies that hire software engineers are buying up the more expensive ($2-4k) MacBook Pros, but I think it's a little early to make the jump to ARM from x86. It's like electric cars... are they the future? Yes. Does that mean there's no demand for ICE cars? No. I think it's musical chairs for all three, and it's just about not being the one holding the bag when the music stops. That said, I think AMD has steam left.You might look at Dell. It only has a PE of 4 but obviously AMD's good fortune is Dell's good fortune and vice-versa. Analysts can shit on it all they like, but I love their laptops, monitors and PowerEdge servers.

Semiconductors will be used in many industries and appliances for years to come.But if you really had to sell one, I'd pick AMD. However that's because I am personally closely following the competition between AMD and Intel and would throw the profits I made from AMD $12 to $150 into Intel as it is right now. Competition is wonderful and both Intel & AMD are key contenders in their fields when it comes to competition with some semblance of predictability to me.Tl;dr; Hold onto your tech stocks. If anything, sell AMD and buy Intel now that the consumer perception for both companies have 'basically inverted'. Everyone claimed AMD would flop and reach the price it's at right now back in 2016/7. Now they're the ones screaming to buy AMD even though it's at a high as is. I could be wrong and it could go higher, but if you got in anywhere before 2021; you've made a profit either way.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 05:53:44'] I'd pick NVDA, just cause it has dividend (despite it being a very low percent). But as someone who works in computer repair and keeps up with all the new mainstream developments. AMD's upcoming line of CPU's has a fair amount of innovation and looks quite promising. Whereas NVDA's new line of GPU looks like it's just going to be the same as the current stuff but more. But both are doing more than AAPL, I'd not drop either of them personally, if you're desperate for AAPL just shave a bit off both maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 05:25:19'] NVDA and AMD are two of the most overvalued stocks on the market.  They've consistently diluted your ownership by issuing shares over the past 2 years.  Apple on the other hand has increased your ownership of the company by 25% over the past 5 years due to share buy backs.  Personally I would wait for Apple to hit $150/share again before buying more, but I would consider dropping NVDA and AMD for Intel.  Intel has the profit that AMD and NVDA wish they had, has an average of 8% revenue growth YoY over the last 10 years, and has issued share buybacks during the process.  However, if I had to pick between NVDA and AMD and which will net me a better return I would pick AMD.  The massive market cap of NVDA makes it hard for them to continue growing.  Also, AMD has initiated a share buyback program and is therefore beginning to offset the dilution that they caused over the past 2 years.

When it is turbulent people shift from one side of the raft to the part that doesn‚Äôt get shaken as strongly so that they won‚Äôt fall off. This is the shift from growth to value. Eventually, it will even back out as the river slows back down. But imagine how much money you lose if you sell every time the herd moves sectors.

NVDA could get harder by possibly slowing GPU sales and could fall back to the low 200s again.  For me it would be a calculation of which is further from the bottom and has more room to fall.  No one knows the future but I think NVDA has further to go.

They're also a leading platform for AI, developers, RPA/process automation, communication, cybersecurity, even fintech. No matter what happens in the business world in the next 5 years, they are well positioned to take the lead. Business spend also tends to be more steady in recessions than consumer spending. Google is also very solid and quite cheap, but have mostly failed to monetize their business outside of ads. They are vulnerable to a big earnings drop if consumer spending falls. Their business is much less diverse than Microsoft. They are also vulnerable to disruption through alternatives to web search, for example by Amazon, Tik Tok, Instagram or other discovery platforms. Nvidia is a clear technology leader but has had the biggest runup in valuation. Their business is in reality quite cyclical, but it's not currently being valued in accordance with that. Like Google they are quite vulnerable to falls in consumer spending or industrial manufacturing. It's a well-run company but over a "short" time horizon of 5 years I'm not sure they can guarantee high returns from their current point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 13:44:16'] Side note: what makes you think companies would cut google ad spending over any other form of ad spending? Yes companies will cut ads in a recession but google/youtube would be the last form of advertising they would cut. Companies would cut literally any other  ad platform before cutting out google. So an argument could be made google would be the only ad company getting all the business as well during a recession. Bc with a tight budget who wouldn‚Äôt choose targeted ad‚Äôs over any other form of advertising?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 23:56:26'] NVDA has some nice AI in house but it doesn‚Äôt compare to SOTA research put out by Google/Deepmind, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Others. What NVIDA has going for it is that it it‚Äôs the furthest along in GPUs for deep learning/ML training, currently maintaining its lead through pushing more power/wattage with ridiculously huge cards/racks. Their GPUs are becoming less efficient, but they have to find ways to push the envelop with the diminishing returns from smaller lithography nodes. Thus far, NVIDIA GPUs are the engine of choice for training ML models and have even brushed off challengers like Graphcore. But it‚Äôs uncertain how long they‚Äôll maintain that lead given the compute wall we‚Äôre facing. At that point, it‚Äôll become a more commoditized play, and my guess is 10-15 years from now Chinese semiconductor challengers will rival NVDA in $/compute. NVDA sees this reality, and you can tell from their last GTC summit they‚Äôre looking to become more of a software services company to differentiate and maintain a locked in customer base as Microsoft, AWS have with cloud. I think there‚Äôs a chance NVDA could innovate into new segments, but they‚Äôll have to go beyond consumer gaming GPUs, automotive, and data center HPC to remain on top when the performance gains shrink. I had money on NVDIA when the ARM acquisition was in play, and would bet more on ARM‚Äôs future (despite their current sales). They seem more chiefly focused in creating efficient designs, optimized ML a workloads; and semiconductor markets are heading that way. AI is for sure here to stay, but the future is more in which AI startups can create the world‚Äôs best domain-specific model. OpenAI, Google, MSFT, others have created these absurdly large pretrained models that are similarly encountering diminishing returns from brute-forcing more compute/data; but it‚Äôs a race to the bottom amongst big tech in licensing those models to other smaller companies fine-tuning the big models for specific applications. That said, just looking at the volume of AI papers and novel applications of SOTA models, my money would be on Google if we‚Äôre to expand the timeline to 10-15 years. NVIDIA for sure has a great future for the next 5, but I‚Äôm unsure about the next 10.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 19:21:32'] The biggest advantage of MSFT is their sale team and their corporate stranglehold.  They are also the most diversified business I've ever seen.GOOG engineering is superior. Their enterprise and cloud products are probably already of better quality. GOOG is the best company in AI as well. Problem is GOOG isn't very good at selling or monetizing their new products.NVDA's business is not as diversified but they have much better growth prospect because there is currently no upper bound on GPU and AI chips demand.It's a difficult choice. Personally I'd go with GOOG. Smaller risk of large drawdown, they are literal monopoly at the things they're good at, their cloud has a lot of growth potential, and they're the best in AI.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 22:45:25'] NVDA has the greatest upside potential. It's a lot easier growing a 3bn income versus 20bn income and coupled businesses adopting AI and ML to improve operations

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 18:54:25'] MSFT with GOOGL as a close second... NVDA has almost no moat... They would need to build substantially better and cheaper chips vs competitors without TSM, AMD, Intel coming in with an even better/cheaper option... I'm not saying NVDA won't take the most market share, but they're competing with a lot more players and potential start-ups (Just last week, the head of engineering at NIO left to start his own chip start up)... No one is working on starting the next Microsoft because it's basically impossible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 17:54:57'] I'll go with Apple in the next 5 years. Only 24% of smartphone marketshare in Q4 and less than 10% in PCs. They are expanding in India that has the fastest growing middle class in the world (i.e. the next China). Plus we should see a glimpse of the next iteration of a mobile computer (glasses?) and potentially dipping into the auto market. Their service is growing fast, making their existing ecosystem stickier and all teenagers spend 4+ hours a day on their phone. Their custom M chips will allow them greater control over Mac development akin to what we saw when they switched to A chips for iPhones. I can see them capturing enterprise and education gradually. Even with regulatory pressures, I can see them potentially doubling in the next 5 years on their way to become the first $10 trill company.

The way they have capitalized on game sharing, and not to mention being the default OS for most work stations, they have a set consumer basis that google and Nvidia have to catch up too. Granted, once those AI begin to mature, the size of Microsoft will judge how much those two will grow aswell, as i can see Microsoft becoming one of their biggest customers, along with the automobile market looking to make autonomous vehicles/equipment. if anything, in 10 years, i see the latter out pacing microsoft, but the foreseeable future is microsoft.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 17:26:08'] I'm not betting against MSFT. They are a machine. GOOG is also a money making machine but facing increasing regulatory headwinds. Ironically I think that could long term unlock more value if one of the sub pieces were spun off but in the medium term it's a hit in share price NVDA certainly has a bright future but things can change fast in the silicon world especially with more companies attempting to go in house following apples success. The stock has also been on a massive run and one that could see a lot of people take profit if a recession hits, also the most susceptible to reduced consumer spending IMO

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 22:20:13'] I don't like the business model of a hardware company. It has the issue where you constantly need to be doing R&D and improving the product just to stay in place. This creates a lot of risk because one bad generation can kill the stock price (see intel vs amd right now).So NVDA would be out for me. Too risky for a concentrated bet, for the reason above.Now between MSFT and GOOG, both are massive tech conglomerates. Both names are fantastic and have strong expected performance in my mind for the next 5 years. Both have a backbone of the company which is basically a monopoly on a consumer tech ecosystem (search vs windows/office).MSFT Pros:\- Bigger cloud presence\- Bigger gaming presenceGOOG Pros:\- YouTube\- Lower multiple at 23 PE vs MSFT at 30 PEI'd tip my hat to slightly to GOOG. It's cheaper and Youtube has no competition whereas MSFT is ahead in competitive spaces (cloud and gaming). Although if they had equal PE I would probably choose MSFT.I'm also assuming none of the moonshots like Waymo or Hololens type projects would become relevant in the next 5 years. So I didn't factor those in, but moonshots could totally change the equation.

If you consider the overall digital ad share in the world, the amount will be in the trillions. Google controls 26% of world digital ad market, with Meta at a close 24% behind. Amazon is only at 14% behind - which reinforces the unassailable lead the two giants have in front.

Although users can now buy fractional shares at most places (f u td ameritrade), I am very interested to see how GOOG will react post split. Don't think you can go wrong with either, NVDA seems to be the more "riskier" play even though everything is made up of chips now a days. One thing to consider is these supply chain shortages exposed a lot of companies, more and more of the upper echelon tech companies could start producing chips in house if they are capable of that to save themselves from future issues like this and save more money. My vote would be GOOG if I had to choose.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 04:42:56'] I own all 3 soooo üòÇ
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-14 04:54:49'] That was an oversimplification. All 3 companies have their hands in AI. Google and Microsoft arguably moreso given their manpower and resources. Nvidia is a once in a lifetime company. I own all three (as a large part of my portfolio) and recommend you do the same. Google does more than just search. They have a myriad of high potential projects, along with self driving cars (Waymo), Android (the world's most common phone OS) and a growing hardware offering. They also haven't even begun to fully monetize products like Gmail and Google Maps. So essentially a ton of potential. MSFT is AI & Cloud first and foremost. Cloud is growing at a breakneck pace, like 30% YoY. Azure will be the engine of growth, while M365 is the cash cow and gaming + surface are the fun consumer growth areas. Nvidia is amazingly well positioned to be the shovel sellers in the new gold rush. In addition to their most important business of data centers & next gen AI, their GPUs are incredibly in demand. The gaming interest isn't going away, along with crypto mining. And as they continue to be market leaders with new chips in the 4000 series demand will continue to flourish. But! There's also the high growth areas of Omniverse (an actually legit metaverse solution for content creators), and self driving car systems. These high growth areas will only increase in importance over the next decade. Lastly, these companies have stellar leadership. Satya, Sundar & Jensen are all A1 world class CEOs that have accelerated their companies growth. They are in it for the long run and you should be too.

Digital advertising STILL has room to grow. People are still coming online believe it or not in the developing world. And the pace of innovation at Google is incredible. Oh and Android and YouTube lol. Nvidia is an incredible company. Management is incredible. The innovation and technical expertise is incredible. The GPUs are top of the line.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:36:56'] It's pretty common for companies to pre-release if there are some big deviations.  The main purpose is to try to reduce the surprise factor and spread out the volatility over a few weeks.  I believe it also helps maintain the integrity of the CFO to some extent.  If there is a huge drop in earnings and no pre-release, investors often rage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:58:16'] I'm planning to add after this drop. The results weren't even that bad - just a big hit on a drop in gaming demand. But other segments grew nicely. The drop in gaming demand is just a temporary issue, not a fundamental shift in the nature of their business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:34:44'] Under promise now, take some pain in advance, over deliver on earnings, watch the stock shoot up instead of crash.Edit:Sorry should have been more precise, when i write "over deliver on earnings" i am not talking about the literal earnings i mean the entire earnings call.By getting the bad news out of the way now you lower the expectations for the actually earnings CALL drastically, if you now manage to beat those on guidance or other positive news you got a realistic chance for an in total positive or at least better than otherwise price movement.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 17:05:57'] Probably to soften the blow when they release earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 17:19:08'] It's an important fact and they must inform shareholders asap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 02:59:01'] Surprises get bad results.   It is better to do earlier.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-09 07:49:46'] Just wait, in a few more weeks after earning they will lower their guidance even lower.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:35:18'] Currently the market bids up everything. many companies release bad news into rising markets. If you release bad news into bad markets, it could easily be a 25% drop.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 18:38:37'] Microsoft - they are more then just product you name it , they make money off it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:16:26'] I personally like MSFT better. Azure cloud services are an incredibly huge part of their business that's only going to expand and become more profitable as 5G and other new network technologies will pave the way for even more IoT systems than what we are currently seeing in business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 20:31:47'] MSFT. It‚Äôs not even close.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:28:03'] MSFT they print money
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 19:19:39'] Microsoft
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 20:05:11'] Microsoft. They have the products and services that print monthly revenue for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:19:37'] Put the majority in MSFT as a safer investment. Sprinkle a little on NVDA while you‚Äôre at it. Or if you‚Äôre feeling risky, reverse that thought.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 07:03:37'] NVDA purely due to growth potential.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 22:20:21'] I wouldn't listen to anyone here.  When Nvidia was 60$ they told me to wait for a pullback to 40 since it's going to high too quickly in 2017 :(( joking it is my own fault for not buying but still.. lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 19:25:38'] MSFT because the fundamentals are stronger. Nvidia is crazy overvalued. Microsoft is just a little overvalued. but if you already have an S&P 500 index, Russell 1000 index or VTI/total market fund, you've already got a lot in Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 00:29:39'] Listen, I love Nvidia. But it's not even close when comparing it to Microsoft for a long term portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 21:51:45'] MSFT. NVDA is probably overpriced at its current price more than MSFT is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 20:19:47'] Buy both
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:40:55'] Have you considered stock slices? I am with Schwab and they offer multiple stocks from sp500 and one can buy a slice of these stocks starting at 5 dollars apiece. So you can potentially buy msft, nvda, amd..etc
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 19:35:04'] I'd I could only have one, I'd go with MSFT. But both are solid long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 10:19:03'] Why a binary solution?  I‚Äôd go 600 or 700 MSFT and the balance NVDA.  Both have essential and outstanding products and services for the next stages of the information economy, but while NVDA may grow faster, MSFT will be steady up and dividend will grow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 11:13:33'] AMD has a lot of room to grow compared to NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 18:41:34'] MSFT for longer term investing.  NVIDIA is good also.  I own it.  You could own both.  One is more in Software and Nvidia is in hardware.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 08:33:29'] You have to understand that $1000 isn‚Äôt going to turn into $10000 anytime soon even putting it all into one stock like MSFT or NVDA. ETFs aren‚Äôt sexy but you‚Äôll likely make a decent return and if the market corrects, it likely won‚Äôt hurt has bad in an ETF as it would in something like NVDA. You have to remember that the market doesn‚Äôt always go up and if shit hits the fan, your $1000 in one stock could very easily turn into $400 quickly.If I‚Äôm buying either MSFT or NVDA I‚Äôd go MSFT. But for me I‚Äôve been eyeballing GOOGL as a better tech buy right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 08:36:19'] Personally I like MSFT, but why not both? Diversify wherever you can to reduce overexposure.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 09:06:36'] I may get blasted for saying this in this sub, but if you want to see a real return on 1k you should consider tqqq. If we keep this bull market running you‚Äôll make a lot of money. It‚Äôs pretty risky but it‚Äôs only a thousand dollars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 09:34:30'] MSFT for 5 year timeframe NVDA if it‚Äôs 5+
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 09:43:15'] Both for me!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 09:49:07'] IMO, people are buying NVDA because it‚Äôs a great performer. I assume you have no idea how to assess why their GPU are better than competitors but you probably can see people are using LinkedIn or Xbox or office products. I‚Äôd go with what you can assess

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 11:22:32'] NVDA is at it below it‚Äôs after split price. Great time to get in and you‚Äôll get more shares. MSFT hasn‚Äôt had a split in a long time and is overdue. You‚Äôd get less shares right now compared to NVDA but it‚Äôs also a solid company that should split eventually, creating a situation where you could get more shares.Edit: get both. MSFT is loooong term. NVDA can make money faster, but it‚Äôs riskier.

Buying one of last decade's outperformers isn't going to give you a greater expected return than the total market, just greater volatility.  $1000 in a total market ETF today is all but guaranteed to outperform $1000 invested in the same instrument 10 years from now.It's like saying "I don't want to spread my bet out over 1000 55% weighted coin flips, I'll only average a 10% return per bet.  If I bet it all on one weighted coin, I could double my money!"  The expected return is the same in both of these scenarios, but the volatility is significantly greater for the single coin. You're not increasing your expected return by picking a single stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 21:22:56'] I think MSFT is much safer. But both are kind of risky at this entry point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 20:25:50'] I put MSFT higher than NVDA. At the moment both are expensive, but MSFT is less so (PEG of 2.82 vs 3.88).  MSFT also has several good business under its belt and a good history of adapting with the current CEO.  NVDA has interesting opportunities in mobile and data center CPUs, but the biggest players are also investing to build their own CPUs; their revenue from cryptocurrency projects is also expected to shrink as everyone is switching to proof-of-stake, so no one will need GPUs for mining in a few years‚Ä¶.   I am bullish on both, but more so MSFT
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 02:31:35'] NVDA are well overvalued and volatile atm...definitely stick with MSFT

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:32:17'] They‚Äôre both pretty darn expensive right now. Being aware of that and trying to base decisions on it has nothing to do with timing the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 21:14:14'] Wait for a bigger correction. 2022 will have several bad corrections that will be nice time to buy either of these stocks. You could buy either one of them now, and sell once they have a 10 percent pop (especially NVDA). Then sell and wait for the next correction. Rinse and repeat. Just try to get four 10 percent pops this year for it (40%)
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 18:51:37'] NVDA.  Founder CEO and visionary.MSFT is lucky that google is such an unfocused mess, with the company so biased in milking ad revenues. They have the products , office,mail,cloud,os - that can go head to head with MS - but for the life of them they can't properly manage to get a revenue focus on those. Once a proper focused management settles in , MSFT will be in serious threat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:17:51'] Why not both?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 18:13:09'] Go for both. Cloud and chips are both vital to current as well as future technologies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 19:01:43'] MSFT 100% long NVDA 100% if you trading short term not investing
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 21:32:44'] MSFT is a better safer choice. In the long run, MSFT will continue to climb up. I currently have four calls on MSFT set to expire in 2023
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 22:53:24'] I see nvda going down a lot after Ethereum moves to PoS in 6 months. Miners buy gpus at any price since compounding stays profitable
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 20:16:35'] Even if Microsoft does well its already up 300% in a couple of years, it now has to grow into its marketcap, which its never a good idea to invest in something everyone "knows" is going to do well.  In the mean time tech could bomb, the economy could collapse, commodities could shoot up, this is why ETF are good.I would suggest IJJ personally.  You can expect a 10.5% return or so on it, historically.  If things crash its well positioned to minimize its downside, given its "value".Nvidia is a stupid idea.  People will downvote this for sure, but theres no guarantee they own the crown for machine learning.  I'm not even sure they produce ASIC's or FPGA, which would be necessary to do so.  They also have these same giant cloud corporations working against them, as well as Intel now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 18:15:20'] Don‚Äôt choose either. Put them on a watchlist and the next correction/downturn load up. Look at the 5 year chart. Ask yourself if your comfortable buying high leading tech stocks with inflation out of control and our fed forced to raise interest rates. Something gonna snap this year or next.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 01:08:54'] NVDA is overvalued for now, wait for it to come down. MSFT is a great company but generally I wouldn't buy a stock at ATH. 1000$ into MSFT won't grow too much. Learn how to analyse businesses and work with stocks that have a market cap of under 10 billion dollars. These are the high flyers if you can actually spot a good company. Remember, BALANCE SHEET BALANCE SHEET AND BALANCE SHEETS. If company produces nothing or next to nothing, forget about it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 04:09:02'] I would choose Google over either of these two.  Or even Apple.MSFT is just got too expensive compared to Google.  Plus Google is growing both their top and bottom lines a lot faster.Last quarter Google put up over 40% growth top line and over 60% bottom line.NVDA is also just too expensive right now.  It has come down a decent amount but there needs to be more before I would start adding to NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 04:05:10'] Idk how people think MSFT is a better choice. It's a shit company that works against the interests of its clients and will surely fall when there's proper competition. Same can be said for NVDA but it's not as bad IMO.Don't take my advice though, I'm not speaking strictly from an investing perspective but more so consumer experience.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 01:52:32'] Choose the company you have a strong feeling for. You're going to want that conviction when the stock drops. Remember you can do both. It doesn't need to be a one or nothing. üòâBut at the moment I am holding MSFT for all the reasons you stated. They have a wider avenue stream. Nvidia is also a strong company, but I'm not sure how strong their moat is. You may want to look into TSM instead. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 02:24:56'] Meh, I wouldn't invest in NVDA right now no matter what.Out of these two, MSFT without a doubt. AMD and INTC are a better investment than NVDA at this moment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 03:44:37'] NVDA is more of a gamble, forward PE is so much higher. MSFT is going nowhere for the next 30 years, so is a safe bet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 06:12:36'] Voo 100% mate. Don't buy a single stock. If you want to go single stocks you need about 20, so you'll be better off just buying the index

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 00:03:34'] I really like $LAC as a long term play, lithium production being brought back to NA and the demand for Lithium will increase exponentially in the coming years. If you have a bigger risk tolerance go with something like this or from your two NVDA (but maybe wait for a lower buy point). MSFT is as safe an equity investment as you can get. Low risk / low reward.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 00:04:42'] Why not both?!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 02:04:19'] Is there any reason you couldn't do both?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 04:32:09'] Personally I think an ETF might be a better option for you, with what you have mentioned.With a fund you get both stocks and more. Any significant movement in the stock market is likely to impact individual stocks a lot more than a fund, i.e. the risk is greater. Since you are 21 your outlook is likely long term (20-30 years)? Be patient. With that timeline you are definitely going to make gains. Plus later on you can always buy a few individual stocks in addition.But that's just me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 05:04:37'] Love NVDA for long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 05:36:47'] I would go with MSFT and AAPL, you can't go wrong with these two.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 05:40:04'] Msft. Its grown revenue for 28 out of the last 30 years, grown EBITDA for 26 of the last 30 years. It's at its median valuation and the company will grow revenue and EBITDA because it is so engrained in our lives and the workplace. It's not expensive it's just not cheap like it was in the early 2010s.  If it decreases in a valuation. Just buy more it will come back up.Nvda is more expensive and the stock will be more boom or bust. I think it's an amazing company that's way too expensive.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 08:26:31'] Still an ETF 100%. Wtf do you mean ‚Äúisn‚Äôt gonna do much‚Äù?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 08:28:17'] MSFT. And just as a recommendation look at AMD. NVDA is great but the valuation is still stretched. AMD is much better value and a great alternative. Or just pick up SMH or SOXX to track the entire sector.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 13:37:28'] MSFT is my biggest investment by far. It can drop every day and everyone on here can tell me it's going to keep dropping forever, and I'd still confidently hold it.NVDA is great too, but idk I just like MSFT a lot more. Ironic because I hate Windows. I also notice that NVDA always drops a bit after they announce their new products. So you'd always have a drop every now and then.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 15:09:30'] With 1000 I would find a medium to small cap company personally. You reference price, but make sure to look at market cap. I‚Äôd say NVDA is more likely to double than Microsoft at these caps. If you like NVDA that much I‚Äôd personally dump it Into AMD. They are about 1/4 the cap of NVDA and there is nothing but growth ahead for chip makers. Note: Not financial advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 15:51:31'] AAPL makes more money than MSFT, has higher margins and a lower PE.  It also has much more loyal customers and is moving into cloud, advertising, more into gaming and is least as brilliant as MSFT in all aspects of tech.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 20:20:11'] Both. Diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 08:11:08'] Both are good long-term investments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-11 21:57:35'] I will invest in both MSFT and NVDA. If I had to pick one, I will choose MSFT because of the consistency, diversification and reliability of their business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-11 22:00:51'] If I had the Rather option, I would go for TWTR. Your $25 a week could give you a nice return over the long term. They have a unique business that has HUGE growth potential. It is only a matter of time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:35:55'] If 1000 is your whole portfolio Put it all in SPHD it‚Äôs a low cost ETF, with about a %4 dividend. Make sure to turn on dividend reinvesting. I also recommend dollar cost averaging, so buy maybe $100 a day for 10 days. While NVDA and Microsoft will likely continue to grow, they‚Äôre value has increased sharply. You could YOLO it, and in that case, the best thing you could do is put it all in Litecoin and hold until you‚Äôre ready to retire. Companies can always issue more stock, there will never be more Bitcoin/Litecoin once it is all mined. At 21, you need to open a Roth IRA (td Ameritrade is what I use, totally free) to buy these stocks in, you can take out the money you put in, but not the profit. and divide your stocks up into sections, growth (mid cap/large cap tech) and dividend. AGNC NNN O all pay high dividends (REITs) that I recommend buying. As far as NVDA v MSFT, NVDA is effected pretty bad by the chip shortage, but has also gone up a lot.Looking forward, I think Apple is set up to do the best, and tends to go up over time historically. As a reminder, stocks typically go down not long after you buy them. Don‚Äôt sell. If you‚Äôre trying to do a yolo, I‚Äôd say Apple call options. If you‚Äôre starting retirement savings, make sure to do it in a Roth IRA and diversify. 1/5th APPL 1/5th MSFT 1/5th AGNC 1/5th SPHD 1/5th NVDA (if you‚Äôre really bullish on them). Everyone needs some Deflationary assets (like Litecoin/Bitcoin) since their supply is limited, but to someone who is just starting out a long term portfolio the above mentioned layout is a great start. But tbh, you can literally just put all of it into SPHD or SPYD, earn dividends and probably beat most anything you tried to put together yourself, and being as young as you are, short term price fluctuations won‚Äôt matter in the long term, especially with dividend stocks. So while NVDA and MSFT are both excellent companies, you are putting all of your eggs into one or two baskets, and investor sentiment tides could change, say if there was a Secuirty breach or recall or dividend reduction. You could also research out some small caps, but for your first $1000 I‚Äôd say SPYD or SPHD or even all Apple. Those dividends will feel good when the price is lower. Try and always max out your Roth IRA. 6k a year, and wait to buy on red days. Two riskier plays that pay dividends are Lumen (centrylink) and T (ATT) that are both cheap right now. My .02

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:15:09'] Nvda was an obvious ‚Äúcompany of the future‚Äù for me at the time (around 2015) when I learned more about semiconductors and the need for them in cloud computing. My first buy was in the mid 60s. I believe at that time AMD was around $9, and I remember buying at the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù at $14 and worrying I had made a mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:22:34'] Imagine you love computers, you want to build a computer. You have other computer lovers in your social circle you ask them for some ideas for good components. You realize you just spent a few grand to build your computer. You know the brands you bought, you know the brands that were suggested to you. You check the market and realize its a publicly traded company. Might not even be that old a year maybe two, you like the products you bought so you decided to invest in the stock you add to your position over time and three years later you end up with an $11 average on AMD and its sitting in the 130s/140s.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:29:38'] After school I started working as a data scientist, decided to save money in stocks put them into stuff that sounded familiar from work plus that nvdia was the only ones making graphic cards that we could use for our computations and we knew deep learning was gonna blow up in the coming years so it was a no brainer. Then I bought some AMD as well cause I figured they were nvidias number 1 competition so I just wanted to cover my bets. Still barely know anything about the two companies or stocks or investments really but those two and getting into bitcoin and ether in 2017 has made me not have to worry about retirement anymore.Edit: so to answer your question, basically it was mostly luck/chance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:33:59'] Held a few hundred shares of AMD when they were down around $4. I bought them because I thought they might have some ground to gain after the whole bulldozer debacle. Unfortunately not a lot of DD, just knew they had a hit with the 64, and hoped they would hit it out of the park again, and be out in front albeit briefly. All gains are good gains. But‚Ä¶I sold at $18. ‚Ä¶Yeah.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:08:56'] For me, I‚Äôm an idiot investor, I bought because of the story. Told my dad years ago to get into NVDA back in 2016. NVDA makes the best graphic cards. Cards used to mine digital coins, help self driving cars and video games. At the time I knew nothing about fundamentals, but I know betting against NVDA is basically betting against those industries. My next bet is RKLB.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:20:36'] Its very very hard to figure out what will pop. Everyone thought when Blockbuster went into shipping dvds that they were going to crush netflix.  All you can do is think about and read what the furure could possibly be. Look past the mainstream FUD and really try to envision what people will be doing on a daily bases 10, 20, 50 years from now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:37:53'] Got in AMD at around $4. Sold around $45 unfortunately.Thought process? They are the only other CPU and GPU maker aside from Intel (CPU only) and Nvidia (GPU only), and they got exclusive contract with Playstation and Xbox.But in a hindsight, it was a bit of a gamble. Their current success was entirely hinged on their new chip architecture design (Ryzen) to be a good one and Intel to screw up their chip fabrications.If Ryzen ended up being mediocre or Intel could still compete with TSMC with their fabs, AMD would not have been as successful as they are now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:57:28'] when i first started investing, I was like humm what should i buy. I thought abt Tesla and at the time I thought Tesla was the cool new kid in the block, and I like Elon, so i was like heck yeah let me buy some. So i bought 64 shares of Tesla for $610 pre split. It went up to 1000 and came back down to 700, so I came to this sub for advice, people told me to sell cuz it's overvalued. so I sold at $680.  &#x200B;Then I heard people mentioning Nio, and being Chinese, I have seen Nio been talking abt on Chinese forum as the new cool electric car, so I bought it 5000 shares a 3 dollar. It went up to 7.50 in a few days, I was so stoked, so I came to this forum and people was like, sell it. you never go broke for taking profits, so I sold it. &#x200B;Had I kept both stocks, they are worth over half a million today. &#x200B;don't fucking come here for advice, no one know what the fuck they are talking abt.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 21:42:23'] Originally I followed WallStreetBets back in the day for the top-tier meme-ing. The fact people could joke about losing crazy amounts of money to me was fascinating. But back then, the WSB guys weren't complete idiots who lost money on purpose, they took high-risk bets with due diligence and proper research. None of that pump and shilling you get these days. The sub is nothing like what it used to be. I wasn't investing at all at that point, not even in indexes. But the hot-stock at the time was AMD. And I found the memes and shitposting around it relatable because I use their products. There was these big rumours abound that AMD was gonna move into the server space, and the sub was convinced that this was basically a money printer. And after two weeks of mulling it over, I figured it was worth a punt. Just for the learning experience. April 16th, 2018. I bought 68 shares for roughly $10 each. I'm still holding them today, with no real pressure to sell. I think taking the jump and 'being right' feels better than the money I'd get from cashing out. Its cool seeing them sat there in my portfolio like some badge of honour.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:29:53'] Just buy and keep'em. That's all.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:46:32'] If Redditors have one area of expertise it's in computers and tech. It's likely that a lot of early investors in AMD and NVDA here were ones who often built their own computers and could see firsthand which companies made the best products.So I guess the lesson here is to leverage your "insider" knowledge and buy what you know and use.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:17:56'] Bought NVDA between 2017-2018. AMD during 2018. Both dropped over 20-30% just after I bought (if you zoom in alot you can see it‚Äôs like a small hill on the graph there). Felt a bit bad but I added some more as my intention was to hold these stocks for 5+ years. My reasoning behind the investments was pretty simple at that point: GPU:s and cloud gamling (NVIDIA had just released their cg beta). The companies are pretty much the only ones who make GPU:s and everyone needs them. Decent financials, lots of growth opportunity. And I also remember checking NVIDIAs homepage where they listed customers like NASA. And yeah that‚Äôs pretty much all I needed to know. Considering how it turned out I just feel like a complete idiot. Not only was I wrong about what their future business would be, I also didn‚Äôt buy anywhere near enough shares :D
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:07:52'] Mine with those companies was the same process as one of Warren Buffet's, "invest in what you know."I was into computers and gaming in the 90s and early 2000s. Nvidia and AMD were very familiar to me. Same with Take-Two. I didn't have a lot to invest then so I bought cheap stocks, and the stocks I bought were mainly companies in industries I knew. In a somewhat similar manner, I like many use cell phones alot now with lots of data. I'm typing on mine now. I also like to travel and have full service wherever. So I kinda "know" that area. AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is building a constellation for direct satellite to unmodified cell phone 5g coverage with 6g forward compatibility. They have agreements with major known companies like AT&T, Rakuten, and Vodaphone. There's great DD in the r/ASTSpaceMobile subreddit. While not an established name like Nvidia or AMD was then, their partners are and I like and want what they offer, there are few real competitors (like AMD and NVDA back then), and I see good growth potential in an area I'm familiar with, so they're a conviction stock for me.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:33:47'] To find the next AMD/NVDA would probably mean having to hold through 30-50% draw downs. Not sure if people are ok with any stock doing that.Its not 2020 anymore where every stock goes up and it easy mode. There will likely be more drawdowns in stocks that make trying to hold the next AMD/NVDA in the near term hard. And that next 10-20x is probably being called overvalued/unprofitable right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 00:27:12'] Literally no secret. We all just used there product and understood at the most basic level that this product is the future. It's really not that complicated. Out there's there is someone looking at X company, thinking the exact same thing but we will never no because we simply lack the expertise! So the best advice is to just invest in what you know. I don't fucking touch medicine stocks, despite seeing my roommate make bank off of them, why? Cause I don't jack shit about medicine!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 18:53:15'] I buy 100ks of and and Nvidia for work, it is a no brained. Engineers need to be in charge of tech companies because they know what we need I've owned AMD since the 20s because it was so obvious of easy gains
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:04:20'] IMO look at new Taiwan companies popping up and find out if they have/ are getting contracts with US tech companies. Same goes with China but is way more hit and miss in regards to delivering quality products so it's not as safe of a bet as Taiwan stuff. Also find someone who has a public following and is into new and upcoming tech who gets sponsored to demo new products - same goes for finding news on tech trade shows and whatnot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:47:29'] Lot of good advice in the thread. I would just emphasize that buying leading companies in rapidly growing sectors, and who will have massive TAM is usually a good place to start your search.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:29:37'] Dad told me to get NVDA. Put it in a Roth IRA. Watched it tumble from 208$ where I got it to 156$ and doubled my shares. I chose AMD because I had just started looking at building a PC (never did) and threw 1000$ at it when it was 11$Planning on getting more NVDA here soon, among a couple others like sklz and irnt
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 20:48:06'] I'd always been a fan of AMD, usually building PCs with their processors rather than Intel due to the price/performance advantage. But it was back in 2017 that I bought their stock; an intern that worked in my dept -- that spent too much time browsing the web -- mentioned the release of the Ryzen and the performance numbers.So I bought a few thousand shares of AMD at $13.50 and later rewarded the intern with a free lunch. Seemed like a fair exchange :)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 23:07:10'] I wasn't in the market back then but basically:AMD pretty much makes the best chips now and kind of has been since they released their first Ryzen series, they've been gaining market share as well.NVDA has been king when it comes to GPUs for ages.The only potential downside you were facing was that Intel could kick AMD's ass but that didn't seem likely.Some people thought that mobile was the game to go, and it kind of is, but guess who makes the hardware for cloud computing and servers... it was always kind of a safe bet.I got into the stock market very recently and I kind of instantly jumped into those two stocks, then again I'm not buying call options so although my gains have been pretty decent they haven't been massive.By the way, this whole Metaverse thing is **very** dangerous, the whole VR thing is very hit-or-miss, I own a VR headset, it blew my mind when I used it for the first several times (same experience everyone had), now my VR headset is nothing more than a dust magnet. Maybe a big corporate push will make it more manageable but right now VR is very niche at best, inconvenient to use, has very little uses for the regular consumer, is clunky, uncomfortable... I believe they *might* be pushing for VR a little bit too early. If they decide to make a massive push for VR say... next year? It'll be dead on arrival.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 00:50:30'] I bought into AMD at around 2 or 3 dollars a share. I heard rumors they were working on a new CPU architecture so I dumped all of my savings into it
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:58:24'] I'm in the industry and have worked at some of these companies and their competitors.  Also, many of my colleagues and grad school buddies have fanned out into the semi companies (there aren't that many of them). I was acutely aware of company culture, morale, and leadership in the semi industry.As an example, in the 2013 to 2014 timeframe, Intel was decimating teams with layoffs and this fostered a shift in morale. Engineers started to go into survival mode rather than focusing on innovating and many of the superstars were jumping ship to competitors. This was in start contrast to it's competitors.It takes about 5 years to create a microprocessor from inception to manufacturing. This means that in 2017ish to 2018ish is when Intel was fully ready to reap the rewards of negative corporate culture. The rest, as people say, is history.This was a very non-qualitative assessment but company culture and its inertia is something that the street and everyday investors either don't have access to or hear rumblings of but choose to ignore in favor of "more concrete" indicators.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 21:31:25'] AMD was one of the easiest convictions I've ever had.I remember back in 2012 when I was building my first crypto mining rig and I purchased some AMD graphics cards, 2nd hand. Reason why I bought 2nd hand was because there was no stock anywhere.5 months later, with the crypto rig fully paid for by the increase in prices of cryptos. I decided to sell my cards. When I checked the market, my cards that have been running overclocked and undervolted 24/7 for 8 months had appreciated in value. I sold them for more than I paid for. Some weren't even working anymore, but the person who bought off me was fine with it as they could still RMA it under warranty. The cards were so out of stock and everyone wanted to get into the hype of mining for crypto. Still is the same today. You still can't get newly released graphics cards because of miners..AMD also makes processors but back then, Intel was clearly winning. But these two companies always take turns to be the dominant chip maker, it was just Intel's turn but today, it is AMD turn to be the dominant player. It will switch again next cycle. Oh.. and AMD also have a monopoly over the console markets. Both Xbox and PlayStation run on AMD chips. And back then, we already knew the new gen consoles will continue running on AMD chips. How was that not priced in, I don't truly know..The price for AMD was like what? $2 usd a share in November 2012? 2 bucks a share!! The shorts are idiots.. How can a company with full monopoly over console chips and crypto mining, collapse? When they shorted AMD stock to $2, they were betting against console gamers and crypto. Idiots..How did people not see an inevitable price rise coming, I don't quite know.This is the same conviction I have for PLTR. Everyone continues to bash this stock and laugh at it but I see a company that has virtually no competition and is absolutely essential. AI combined with data analytics is THE future of our society. There's no two ways about it and PLTR is the sole company that already has a working product in this field. The closest competitors are decades behind in development.I also think there are some commodities that are underpriced.  Namely coal as people will realise that renewables isnt sufficient to maintain energy demand and the pent up demand is about to swing back in coal favour. Lithium is also going up still as more and more batteries are required to build EVs. If Tesla is going to the moon, then so is lithium stocks.

I built a pc, and in the process saw the lengths at which people will go to get their hands on some products, the infinite ceiling of demand, and huge inflating prices for their products in the resell market. It‚Äôs a small market too, not too much competition in a market of 2 monopolies dominating retail gaming GPU‚Äôs as id assume their most profitable products. It‚Äôs also an expanding market, gaming is beginning to overtake the entertainment industry as one of the largest forms of media, art and socializing.

However i was shaken during the fall earlier this year and i started questioning my beliefs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 19:47:17'] Intel couldn't afford AMD to go bankrupt since their x86 architecture cross license was non transferable. Also if i recall correctly I think Intel had more than 90 percent of the server market share at the time of the first Ryzen release, I figured it was only matter of time before they get even a fraction of the server market share. I had bought 8k shares prior to the Ryzen release at 6 dollars at the age of 22. 3 years of volatility shook me out at 9 dollars before the final breakout past 15 and up to 20 dollars and above. I was at the airport at the time and I remember selling my shares.There is such thing as knowing more than the market. Just because you see value in something it doesn't mean the market will pick up on it right away. Personally I think you need to look at secondary stocks that are struggling with their numbers but are making drastic and aggressive changes around the company and can steal market shares with the leading stock companies. I didn't become a millionaire, but i hope my input provided some good context.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 07:42:04'] they get alot of grief on Reddit, but Motley fool premium really changed my life.  I dont buy every one of their picks, but their strategy really resonates with me.  Find companies of the future in the 3-50B range, dont worry too much about current price, and hold them for a long time. NFLX $85 in 2016NVDA ~$190 in 2017TSLA ~$220 in 2016There have been a few misses that I've gotten out of (not claiming they're perfect). Take those in stride and cut the losers. (DD, IRBT, BB).I'm attracted to companies that are disruptive and well positioned for atleast the next 10 years that play well into high level macro trends, and tons of people were screaming they were overpriced at the time.  I employ other strategies, but this is probably the easiest to replicate.Contrast these to popular companies (I'm about to get a ton of hate, LOL) WISH, GME, AMC, CRSR.  I'm sure there is money to be made trading these, and these type of plays are perfect for some people... but they dont fit for me.  I just dont see them as market dominating in 5-10 years, at best they're undervalued and can become mediocre (in my view).
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:02:04'] I believe both AMD and NVDA were pummeled in the past because they were viewed as primarily video card companies, additionally AMD being viewed as losing the x86 processor competition to Intel...and questionable survivability.So both of these are turnaround stories, I don't follow them closely,  can anybody shed light on how they pivoted and when/how it became obvious that the pivots would succeed?I'm speculating it may actually be due to being in the right business at the right time, as suddenly crypto and AI took off raising demand for GPUS? ...as opposed to something that NVDA or AMD did, is that right?  AMD seems to have also had great improvements at Operational execution  recently in their competition with Intel.  Anybody have any insights into how they were able to turn the tables in this fight?Thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:05:03'] Reddit loves to hate on Motley Fool, but got in on NVDA at $35 because I read an article.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:15:35'] I was pretty sure AI was going to be the next thing so I just bought a lot of invidia stock because they were the first company that I noticed talking about server level AI. And then of course they start introducing video cards and I see people talking about how CUDA cores are probably the number one way in the world for people to be mining right now. That's it just hold on to my stock after I found out this company was really great. Ever since the split I've had a lot more than I need so it's been a great blessing. I run a group on Facebook for trading now and we make tons of money using a process called high volatility watching.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:52:53'] Kinda off topic but would amd and nvda be good to invest into for like somewhat long run? (Sorry newer here wasn‚Äôt sure where a good place to ask questions)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 09:43:52'] Personally as a PC gamer, AMD and Nvidia were big on my radar when I started investing a year or two ago. They were the 2 biggest names in  computer hardware and knowing that their hardware creations would power future technologies outside of just gaming was a no brainer to me.When AMD proved it could make as good if not better chips than Intel was when they really took off.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 09:51:18'] I used AMD products in a PC build and I really liked them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 09:52:03'] This was a fun exercise to think back on and clarify my strategies:1. In a growing / turnaround / new market (where is the world going?)2. Has great technology, processes, or product (leader or 2nd place in space usually, I like underdogs)3. Has a dedicated customer base (when someone geeks out on a company, I look if I can buy it)4. Company trends improving (5 year chart, 1 year chart, EPS growth, new management, etc.)5. Margin of business (not critical for me in whether I pull the trigger, but is considered)Here's are my top winners of all time: TSLA, ENPH, AMD, SHOP, NVDA, SQ, ROKU, MATCH, NFLX, MARAI have high conviction in others that I've just held less, but I think have great potential: TTD, NOW, SPOT, MVIS, BEAM, CRSP, and a stock that I don't think I can name here.Go to where the puck will be, do not chase the puck.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 10:06:33'] I knew AMD when I was a high school kid. I remember reading the launch of the original K6, so this brand has been with me for decades. And I have always been into computers.And then this: https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/anton-shilov/amd-bulldozer-was-not-a-game-changer-but-next-gen-zen-x86-core-will-be/I saw these big names joining AMD. All these guys are very capable and if they decide to join a company like this, they will fix things. Especially when they are given a free hand. But the market did not respond to that until it is close to the original Zen launch. Hence profit, but not without -50% dark ages in 2015.Btw, I still think Rory Read is underrated, but well it's all history now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 10:49:44'] Five or six years ago I literally saw someone say, "Buy AMD" on Reddit. I thought, "Fuck it" and bought like three shares because I was 25 and broke. I'm still holding onto them but I wish I bought more. Oh well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 10:52:03'] I bought AMD at $6 and still hold. I was into video games and read that AMD was going to supply chips for both PS3 and XBox. I figured gaming was going to continue to grow, and so will the need for other high-graphics high-processing applications (like VR and AR). I was going to sell my position after Christmas when PS3 and XBox numbers came in, but then Lisa Su had all these restructuring plans and was even more bullish on gaming, so I stayed in. I was also briefly explained what a GPU was, and thought that as electronics become more mobile, there will be a need for that. Not so much research skills than it was luck, but I guess the takeaways are: 1) in a gold rush, invest in companies that supply the picks and shovels, and 2) figure out if the gold rush is legit and growing, or a fad.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 11:21:43'] You can't. They had as much clue as you do now, back then.AMD and NVDA are the only 2 makers of GPUs in the world (that matter)... Be like investing in Intel now, of course it will go up, but it's going to belong and boring.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 11:22:19'] For me it was the fact that AMD was making computing cheaper for people like me when it came to gaming.At the time I worked in manufacturing and understood the economic value or 3D computing and the challenges of it. I found AMDs energy vertical with alternative currencies very intriguing and made me understand their server side growth. This was when I was a computer science student.I'm still bullish on AMD and I'm inspired by its future with Xilinx. I'm probably more excited about Xilinx today than I am AMD.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 12:07:17'] Bought AMD 1000 shares in 2014 for about $3.50, sold a day before the pandemic crashed the US markets, bought some back discounted, sold some again, have a little bit left at around $40.Back then it was Intel or AMD. If another tech group like Google or Microsoft wanted to start making chips they'd buy out AMD so it was simple. The company turns it around with market capture or get bought out. Win-win. Stock was dirt cheap with only upside in the future. They were a player in the market, not a fad. If they went under and filed, someone would buy them up and I'd either get my money back or a little bit more than that. In at NVDA for $60, bought during the pandemic when everything crashed. Gaming and crypto, what else do you do during lock down? Tech leader in that space. Only could go up with demand.I made a lot of money off AMD but not near if I had just held it straight. Either way, if the cards are right buy and hold.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 12:44:13'] When I started my retirement account, I put 2 grand into Intel. That 2k eroded to $800. I sold my 55 shares of Intel, and picked up 110 shares of NVDA. Then I sat on it for ages. It wasn't really doing much, but I wasn't losing. The years pass, and NVDA has improved to $125 per share. I decide to diversify by selling 10 shares to pick up 100 AMD at $11. I stupidly cashed AMD at $55 because I thought it was getting overvalued. They had never shown a profit, and were NVDA's little red headed step brother. But I held on to my initial batch of 100 (now 400) NVDA. What's the next one? Who knows

Well he didn't so I bought 1000 shares.  Unfortunately sold it all around $17 when ATH was around $23 cause Tesla had just did a split and I thought that was the tippy top of Tesla.What hurts is I had some $1 leaps on NIO that I sold right before the new year where they jumped from $1 range to $60.  Oh well...
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 14:51:03'] I got into AMD in Jan 2019 @ $20.47. I had read about their upcoming move to a 7nm production process, that their main competitor in the CPU space (Intel) was stuck at 14nm, and what that meant from a computational power perspective. Saw that if they could scale production, get the software side at least halfway decent, and got other companies to take them seriously by designing software to utilize their architecture efficiently that they could steal huge market share like they did back in the Athlon days. There were also issues Intel was dealing with like the kernel security issues in the way Intel CPUs execute tasks. Other things have reinforced my conviction like market share gains in both CPU and server segments.All of that together gave me enough conviction to start a position and have been adding periodically since. I've done quite a bit of profit taking along the way but I'm still holding on to my initial position of 500 shares @ 20.47 like a green throphy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 15:17:43'] A lot of the same reasons I think Unity is going to be absolutely MASSIVE soon. They‚Äôre an extremely healthy company, recently gone public, any gamer knows their name and knows they‚Äôve been a huge component in gaming for the past two decades. They offer a service I use a ton, and their stock is undervalued.Applying that same method to other stocks, I would ask myself two questions:Do I currently buy their products? Not ‚Äúwould I buy‚Äù but do I already use them in my life, or have in recent times. And two, how are they valued relative to competitors. Based on that, if a company I can trust and I believe offers a superior product is valued lower than their next biggest competitor, then it only makes sense that they would eventually grow past their competitor. And of course this isn‚Äôt a perfect strategy, but it‚Äôs one I‚Äôve found a ton of success with, and it‚Äôs very similar to Buffet‚Äôs strategy. Buy stocks you believe in and don‚Äôt sell, because eventually they will grow past the competition and you want to be there for the ride.

I followed AMD cuz I rooted for the under dog. I wasn‚Äôt a big fan of intel with all the overpriced cpus. This was when AMD just broke through with their ryzen technology and I read up on it on the tech forums. Everyone was poo pooing them for it. I even told my aunt to invest in them and she didn‚Äôt.  Sometimes the technology is just so great and people just sleep on it. Idk. But now I invest in monthly dividend stocks . Gadda start somewhere again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 21:18:29'] As soon as bulldozer was out the window and Ryzen showed promise, AMD was to be bought at around $4 a share. Similarly with nvidia, at the release of the 10-generation it was clear that AMD's offerings were far behind. Nvidia has enjoyed a monopoly in the high end GPU range since the pascal architecture.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 22:08:07'] I bought AMD in 2017. It was the first investing I had ever done. I knew one thing; AMD had a badass CEO who was going to disrupt Intel with ZEN (AMD new chips). And so I went all in AMD at around 30 dollars. So my process: Establish the company had solid leadership. Establish they have a great product that is scalable. Establish they are in a growing market. Establish they are growing revenues Thats pretty much it, if those check the boxes works good for me. I wrote this high on meds sorry I tried my best
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 22:38:03'] I never bought Nvidia but in hindsight their links to AI and machine learning were very easy to see. AMD however was a clear transformative moment when Ryzen was released. They instantly went from being a joke to a contender. Their business model and tie in with TSMC was bound to out innovate Intel who had become hugely complacent after monopolising the market. There‚Äôs still room to grow for AMD and I‚Äôve said to myself that I won‚Äôt sell until they reach parity in size to Intel. They have a clear advantage in the markets that matter and have the partnerships to keep taking marketshare from Intel. But I‚Äôve also bought Apple now because I think Apple Silicon could need another turning point for The industry.TLDR: invested in AMD after pivotal Ryzen moment
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 22:42:14'] I bought nvda and amd in several stages and have a lot of profit from them... and still buying even now since I still believe in their future and planning on holding very long, I think the most important thing I saw and see in them is that they are always aiming on building the future, they plan big, they want to build the best, they want to be a lot more then just gpu's... the rtx 3000 series is a great example since nothing could compare to it... You want the best? You buy nvda
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 23:04:06'] I think most PC enthusiasts see that AMD and NVDA will/already is the leader in their space. But many PC enthusiasts aren't interested in stocks and/or could never imagine it will moon this, for a lack of a better word, *bigly*. I think if you ask an enthusiast/expert in a field, you can get some good companies to invest in, but it's pure luck on how well it would be.Now, if Apple isn't what it is - a tightly integrated company, and they spun their chip division off, I would throw my money at it so quickly. They're clearly the best ARM chipmaker there is. If they're releasing the chips to be built in normal computers as well, I'd wager INTC, AMD, and NVDA would be in some serious trouble, but Apple is not doing that. And AAPL already is the most valuable company in the world so.....

When buying a gaming lapotop or pc you gotta know atleast a little of good components, watch some linus tech tips or other videos, realise intel always  just had a monopoly so they didn't really have to do their best. Then capitalism and competition happend. Amd entered the game and they are willing to go to the next level. My guess is they're just beginning. Most premade laptop and pc's readily available in shops or given by companies are still intel (my guess is they still have contracts with intel). But that will all change in the coming years or intel really has to step up their game.Join all communities, see what they use and why they use stuff. Getting into fan communities of every industry, the comments alone can already tell you which product is shit and which is good.

When Lisa Su came into picture I instantly liked her for her professionalism and honesty. When they laid the plan for new Ryzen processors - I was almost certain they are not bullshitting, I trusted them (I did my own DD ofc).    AMD's plan made perfect sense and it was becoming apparent at that time that Intel can't keep bullshitting their way through anymore and will have it more difficult to cheat on the same scale again (the antitrust cases were gaining traction at that time).    I felt it was one in a lifetime opportunity, where I thought that I am 100% correct on this.    To put it simply - I believed AMD plan and story because I thought they are professional and honest. I knew Intel's plan was bullshit because they are crooks and cheats.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 03:28:20'] Amd and nvda are everywhere. If you ever thought about buying computer parts these are two of the main companies. Anytime you see a product constantly and spoken about positively you should check out the public company associated.    The only issue is replicating that now is impossibly hard with how many retail investors exist and how quick people are to buy up stocks. At the time when I bought AMD it was $12. Sat on that stock for 4 years to go to $55 and 2 more years to hit what it is now. It‚Äôs a slow grow and was a ticket that was frustrating to see beat earnings and still not gap up. Now look at these past earnings everything is 8% up or down. IV is never sub 40% for anything. The only other stock that I can think of that I knew would be a sure fire winner long term was Tesla and it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm a fanboy but because of how much word of mouth and product growth you saw of this company combined with how crazy the leadership was for this company. If you live in a liberal city or basically the main two New York and San Fran you saw first hand how many Of these cars month after month pop up.    If I was to look for something like this again my bet would be a fast casual looking to grow nationally with strong infrastructure in real estate, online sales, and employee recruitment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 03:33:40'] Mad money w/ Jim cramer
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 03:36:43'] In case of AMD, it was easy for me to understand.Basically you had Intel, that was an actual monopoly without being a monopoly, telling everybody how they should work, regardless of clients needs, and charging a hefty amount of money for meager gains in CPU alone, without mentioning other expenses for arming a decent PC with pricy motherboards and heatsinks.Then you had clients (above average IT literacy and beyond), that understood their programs and workloads, that would sacrifice overall cpu speed, in favor of a less speedy CPU but capable of handling more work in parallel a more efficient manner, that was even cheaper than their available counterparts, and promised to maintain the same platform a couple of years even when their CPUs have been improved.   Then the rest was history, AMD improved their CPU, making it run faster, improved their CPU work in parallel, made its CPU do more with less, and even run at a lower temperature, while Intel until now, is basically pushing CPU at a higher frequency, and running a lot hotter with every iteration, with minor improvements to CPU design.  Then came the blows of security concerns, the last few years, patching security flows in Intel CPU had a high penalty to Intel CPUs, while AMD had a lot fewer, and with a lot lower penalty.&#x200B;The few advantages that Intel has over AMD are:  1. Intel have their own silicon foundries.2. Intel have a big check book, with a big account, and loads of money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 04:05:02'] I built a gaming PC just before lockdown, my first one in a long time having been a PS player. I was surprised that AMD was the dominant force in CPU and not Intel then covid came and I had spare money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 04:20:08'] You need to be willing to buy upcoming technologies when they are still cheap / out of favor. Some examples today would be things like IONQ, a few years ago it was TSLA.. etc every year there are a couple opportunities like this and it‚Äôs important to take them. Not all will work out, but in the end, the returns you get on the winners like AMD, Tsla, NVDA will still drive outperformance in your portfolio vs. the losers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 04:23:12'] I bought at about $10.50. At the time wifi was new but on its way and I looked for a business that would be needed in the new internet/wifi era.  Over the years I have doubled my value and sold 50% of the shares two times and am close to a third sell off.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 04:26:47'] I also read blogs, news, instagram posts saying intel has a problem w heat while amd is the better product. So for myself it was clear amd is better than intel. And i bought it. I do a lot of screening and afterwards do the research. So i also find stocks like digital turbine, acm research
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 04:28:38'] I bought into both beginning of the year. Not that early but I‚Äôm still over +100% I‚Äôm into gaming and have an amazing PC with NVDIA tech.  The only options on the market for good home PCs that could process to my requirements are either NVDIA or AMD.  Investments were a no brainier.  I piled on the AMD dip when it was trading at 78 for a few weeks around May
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 05:09:53'] I bought AMD at 9 a few years back. I build computers for a hobby, so it was a no brainer for me. But honestly I didn‚Äôt buy into it thinking, ‚Äúoh yeah, this is going to be 150 in a few years‚Äù, it was, ‚Äúoh I love computers and I love what this company does‚Äù. Buying companies I actually believe in has been my main DD for years now. Take a hobby you have, find a public company that‚Äôs in your hobbies area, and get some shares! After all, as someone in the hobby, you would know best what companies to look for :)

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 05:29:22'] Put about 25% of my portfolio into ITM & OTM leaps on both companies within the last 12 months. The overarching reason being these companies are able to handle supply chain constraints better than others. Apple is facing supply shortages but you won‚Äôt see new iPhones listed for 100% markup on eBay. But try to procure the newest GPUs from either of these two and you can expect insane markups. But both individuals and businesses will have to pay whatever price is set because GPUs and CPUs are going to continue to be integrated into every facet of life IoT related. Then with the metaverse being the new hotness just increases the need for GPUs. Not to mention crypto mining. The future use less is expanding. Also NVDAs AI capabilities are top 5 globally right now coupled with their data center business booming it made the conviction to buy NVDA easy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 05:58:39'] I think I bought NVDA around 2005 or 2009 based on a Motley Fool recommendation. As soon as I saw the recommendation I bought because it was a company I recognized and understood. I've sold off shares a few times over the years to rebalance, and I sure wish I hadn't.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 06:03:15'] I got in at 27 in AMD (2019 I think), then bought more later, I think my average is 40. I wanted to get in at like 16 but I ended up putting it off. I bought AMD because I used them. I had a ryzen cpu in my computer, my PS4 was powered by AMD, they really seemed to be coming back. Their server chips were looking good as well which was huge.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 06:18:17'] I bought NVDA at $13 several years ago.  I had just sold a tech stock and wanted to replace it with another.  I asked a gamer friend what is out there that excites you and he immediately said the NVDA graphics card.  I'm not a gamer, when I was a kid we played with giant refrigerator boxes for a week.  So I did my usual due diligence and found that not only were sales and profits rising but the company had almost $3 in cash for every share and paid a nice dividend.  Every time I go to my Oncologist or Dermatologist, I ask them, what have you seen in the pipeline that excites you?  I ask my techie friends the same questions.  We all have limited knowledge, I like to get a consumer's take on companies that I have no familiarity with.

Other times, I was hearing more and more about amd cpus in data centers, that turned out to be true. We started using them at work, they were cheaper than intel and performed better with less energy i believe. Their chip design seemed pretty solid too in the newer chips. We had an amd engineer give a talk about it. Then at some point I bought a bunch becasue amd seemed to never break 100 or go below 80 so I was using it to sell options
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-12 06:43:18'] Gut. I mined dogecoin in 2013 so I thought GPUs were super hot and bought 2016 or something. Couldn‚Äôt decide which stock so I bought both.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:20:44'] While the stock has been very expensive (read: overpriced) for a while, I think long term this company is just getting started.They‚Äôre in a ridiculous number of high-growth fields either as leaders or only just starting in them, including:-	Kings of AI/HPC data centers, networking, and software with all of their CUDA libraries. Huge moat having all components.-	Graphics where they‚Äôre by far leading innovators in rendering (RT/PT, DLSS, etc.)-	Omniverse/multiverse initiatives for simulation and design work.-	Autonomous vehicles with MB and JLR as committed customers for their full solution (chips and software). And they‚Äôre partners with so many startups.-	5G/Cellular initiatives (don‚Äôt know much about this).-	Jetson for AI and robotics.I see people comparing them to AMD and other chip makers, usually looking at their consumer graphics cards and saying how similar they are. But the reality is that it‚Äôs not even close. Nvidia isn‚Äôt a chip company. They‚Äôre far beyond that now. All of this info is in their quarterly summaries and GTC presentations.With their CEO (who is also a cofounder, always a good thing) and their large array of high-growth fields that they‚Äôre investing in, I have high confidence that this company is going to keep growing for several years to come.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:00:45'] Long term they are fine. Great company and has a giant moat in the data center for AI and ML.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 15:06:46'] Just adding my two cents. Short term, overvalued. Long term, they still have a lot going for them even without everyone being at home like they were during the high points of pandemic. Aside from the home productivity/gaming, they are still in a dominant position for EV and AI, both of which are still growing fields. I'd be shocked if they didn't have good long term growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:43:58'] If Nvidia is good long term, then now would be the time to buy?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:16:00'] It has been ridiculously overvalued and it's still expensive. But it could get into territory where I'd think about buying some. 130-140 is where I, personally, would potentially nibble, although I'd look closer to 100-120 for a reasonably sized position.Long-term I think it's likely gonna be a good buy, although one shouldn't take that for granted imo.Whether to add or not is not something we can tell you. It depends on your position sizing, your risk tolerance, your exposure to other companies/assets, your goals and your expectations for the company. Do you expect them to trade significantly enough above where you'd buy them even based on the weaker guidance and possible headwinds? If the answer is yes and all the other factors line up, perhaps it could be a buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 02:30:18'] I think growth will stagnate, there are some trends working against Nvidia. First integrated graphics get get better each year, so less need for a graphics card. Trend long-term is SoC, not special HW. Krypto stagnates and trend to proof of stake will drop demand for cards drastically. Cloud providers build their own ml chips. So my advice would be sell asap
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:03:24'] Its a good holding. Dont sell
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 04:03:33'] I worry long term for the independent chip makers.  I think you will see the chips more and more come from the big guys like Google and Amazon.Apple already makes their own chips.I think that is the future.   The market has completely changed because of cloud and smartphones for chips.It use to be that Dell bought chips from Intel and sold their servers to zillions of different companies.But that is not longer how things are. Today companies are not buying their own servers but instead buying the service from Google, Amazon or Microsoft.     Since it is concentrated it makes sense for these companies to create their own chips.Google for example has already done this with AI.   Google has now created four generations of TPUs and will continue to develop their own chips.  Google is now doing their own smartphone chip and would expect that to just grow to more areas.Amazon is doing their own chips for their cloud.   Microsoft is the lagger in this area but would expect them to do the same.You will see the same thing happen with self driving.  It is already happening with Google/Waymo.    Waymo uses Google silicon for all the training.   Which is where the money is at.  But I would expect we will also see Google silicon used for inference in the cars.Tesla is another example of the same thing.  They do their own silicon instead of using a third party.     These are the two leaders in self driving.  Waymo with robot taxi and Tesla with cars you buy and neither is going to use Nvidia long term.   Tesla is today using Nvidia for the training aspect.   With Cruise deciding on using the Google Cloud I would expect their training also to go to Google silicon.https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/how-cruise-tests-its-avs-on-a-google-cloud-platform

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 15:23:59'] I like it at $120, that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll finally buy. But headwinds with ETH 2.0 don‚Äôt look good. They had a lot of demand due to ETH but 2.0 won‚Äôt require nearly as many cards. Plus gamers now have the NVIDIA cards that were impossible to find. The used market will be flooded with these.Great company, not a great investment at current prices in this macro environment. Still think there‚Äôs plenty of room to fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:05:16'] ~40x earnings still, right? Slowing economy, crypto in a rut. Slowing earnings too. Great company, bad investment, imo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:49:02'] Its a great company, but it is still expensive. Let's assume a 15% growth rate for 10 years. That would be very generous given the cyclicality of the semi-conductor market, but lets roll with it. The company currently has 3,91$ EPS TTM and paid 0,16$ in dividends. Assuming a 20% dividend growth rate for the 10 years and 20 PE in Year 10 -  the price would be 124.63$ if we want 10% return. If you want more or a margin of safety (which should be required for a cyclical industry) or the earnings growth slows just a little, 124.63$ would be too high. I think that given the current climate, a good margin of safety is required (especially as with 4-5% inflation you lose a lot of real returns). So for 70$ a share, I think I might buy Nvidia if nothing on the growth and earnings side changes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:29:22'] For me it is still overpriced - same as [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/saqkdx/when_will_nvda_be_a_good_buy/htvguvn/)New points: * The war actually started* Recession* AI/ML startup will have harder access to VC money => less money for the HW* Crypto price

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:48:12'] Great company and all but I can‚Äôt see a reason for it to be someone‚Äôs largest holding either unless you‚Äôre pretty dang diversified.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 18:43:49'] I dca‚Äôed down on plenty of positions and at some point it‚Äôs time to just hold. It‚Äôs dangerous to hold too much of any one stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 14:45:07'] I used to be very bullish in Nvidia but Unreal 5.0 engine set my expectations back a lot.In the long run I expect Nvidia to go deep into image recognition like face detection as well as AI in terms of imaging. They probably have a strong lead in AI related tech with image support like self-driving. They will also have a lot of cloud in visual production process like movies with a lot of them moving into virtual instead of movie set.The drawback is the release of Unreal 5.0 that sort of put a cap on Nvidia. It's a software solution that suddenly make Nvidia less valuable. It sort of make other developers like AMD, Intel and Qualcomm looking like decent alternatives.

POST_TEXT: b"I'm well aware of each of these companies' financial statements but I actually don't know that much about either of these companies' business models. I know they're both oriented towards data centers and to a lesser extent gaming but what's the main difference between the two? I know NVDA is getting into the AI sector - is AMD doing the same? What are AMD's future prospects? Is it possible that, in 20 years, AMD could have a year with a revenue growth rate of 30% (not saying 30% CAGR for the next 20 years - just wondering if it has the business model to be able to pull off impressive growth at any given point of time in the future)? NVDA has a higher multiple right now so the market obviously thinks it has better future prospects. What are you thoughts on that?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 22:26:20'] NVDA - makes GPUs and has AI platforms. Their chips have seen gaming and crypto-mining tailwinds. It is the GPU leader, bar none. Most compellingly, its chips are used in data centers which is the most attractive part of the semiconductor side of its portfolio.AMD - makes processors for computers like Intel but its absolutely destroying Intel and eating that company's market share, which makes it a big winner. It also makes GPUs like NVDA, but they're not market-leading. It's chips are also used in data centers, which has seen explosive growth.Personally, I think both stocks look expensive. I can't pretend to understand where NVDA sits in the AI development world, so I stay away because the semiconductor side seems a bit overpriced especially as we hear gaming companies come out with less-than-stellar quarters and the recent crypto crash. I'd buy this stock for the data center story and AI story, but at lower multiples.AMD is more reasonably valued and is probably near fair value since it is such a share-taker in its space. I believe there are better chip stocks out there than these two, especially given their higher multiples, that being said there is no doubt these are best-in-breed chipmakers and companies, and I wouldn't argue passionately that you wouldn't see returns even investing at these levels but given their strong outperformance recently I personally would wait for a price correction for jumping in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 22:10:32'] Both are moneymaking machines with some overlap and much uniqueness.  Own both and be glad.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 22:45:53'] They have significant overlap these days thanks to the Xilinx and Pensando purchases giving AMD products in areas they didn't compete previously (AI/ML acceleration, automotive, some parts of networking), but Nvidia doesn't offer as broad a portfolio as AMD does currently.That being said, Nvidia has owned the data center GPU market for many years and has a strong networking portfolio thanks to buying Mellanox a few years back with one of the strongest software moats of anyone not named Microsoft, so they've been very successful and are very richly valued as a result.AMD does seem poised to take some share in the data center GPU market, but it's an uphill fight with any successes mostly limited to HPC so far. I'd still favor AMD over NVDA given the more diversified business, less rich valuation, and their status as a share taker in both CPUs and GPUs, plus what I regard as an essentially unrivaled silicon IP portfolio (CPU, GPU, DPU, FPGA, SoC, and 2.5/3D packaging) that gives them enormous flexibility in deciding what markets to compete in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 20:53:13'] Amd probably has more growth potential, either way strong holds in the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 04:34:25'] Think both will get more and more competition from the big guys.  Google has already been making their own AI chips and apparently they are pretty good."Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsApple already was doing their own for their phones and tablets.  Now they are doing their own for their laptops.Amazon does their own chips now for their cloud.   In addition to the other stuff they have.Tesla now does their own and no longer going to use Nvidia in the cars is my understanding.  Well in the cars.  I suspect Tesla is still using Nvidia for the training.I would expect this trend to continue.    Not going to hurt AMD or Nvidia for a long time.    But I could see it being an issue if you look way out on the horizon.The big tech companies are just so huge now that they can make a ROI to do their own chips.   The world changed.   What is kind of interesting is that I am old.  Like really old.  So I remember when it was like this in the beginning and then changed.  Use to be that DEC, IBM, and the others did their own chips.We are going full circle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 20:10:53'] NVDA is more of an inventor, AMD more of a producer. That being said AMD is a world leader in CPU tech thanks to their own R&D but in general I would say this is the bottom line. As for specifics I recommend both companies investor presentations. An easy to grasp slide presentation. But like you said NVDA is heavily exploring AI and machine learning. Much thanks to their superior product and access to next gen products they are a front runner within this field.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 21:19:08'] AMD has a path to making their evaluation make sense within known markets, NVIDIA needs the AI/Machine Learning market to really take off, and always need specific hardware acceleration to accomplish. I have very real questions about how large the AI acceleration business will be as AI may not have as wide an application scope as expected and general compute may end up fast enough for most uses. Both are fairly risky bets at current price, but I would feel more comfortable with AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 03:02:08'] Both are great companies. Both are expensive. If growth stalls even a little bit, the downside will hurt more than the upside of growth at this price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 19:28:27'] For gaming, Nvidia is a better product. They seem to lead the charge with innovation and creating new bells and whistles that didn't exist before or at least haven't been done well enough before. Some of this is also around AI such as DLSS.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:48:50'] I‚Äôve had NVDA since it was a $3.50 stock. Back then the p/e was around 12 or 13. I just trimmed my position a bit because this valuation does seem out of hand, especially if the economy gets shaky, but it‚Äôs still one of my largest holdings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:35:17'] Hopium and a huge amount of puts that outweighs the calls in premium. Big guys want money and will move the stock to make the most.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 16:36:46'] Hahaha get a load of this guy, he still thinks the market moves on fundamentals.Sir, this is a casino. Have you seen AAPL and TSLA? Nothing has to make sense anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:12:37'] They are larger in market cap than Intel, AMD and TSMC combined. Of course they are overvalued. Intel spends double on R&D. TSMC makes their chips. Nvidia's entire market cap is built up because some engineers decided to allow people to use their cards more directly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:39:21'] You forgot the biggest negative: what they did to my boys at EVGA.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:59:26'] I think it's carried by sentiment. There are people who don't look at fundamentals but think " it's a great company with a great future" which buy stock. They are not wrong, but leave out price in their analysis.Right now is the perfect time to fomo NVDA.Some people are great at trading on sentiment and make a killing, because they time right. Others are just lucky. I suspect most of the current retail NVDA investors will stand in the rain somewhere down the road.I held NVDA briefly, bought at 200, sold at 220. No regrets. I am not that good being long on sentiment. Makes me itchy. I don't have to be there for every party.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:00:22'] I think this is the point I jump off the Nvidia train. Question to you guys is- do I take the Short Term Capital Gain and pay 24% in taxes or do I wait until July and hope the stock stays relatively consistent and make it a Long Term Capital Gain?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:24:30'] To be fair to the bulls, it's not like this is a hype stock that has no earnings and is just pure magic in the air. There is a strong underlying business with good fundamentals. The question now is whether the price reflects a fair value that you should pay for that business.Despite the YoY revenue declines, I think once the economy emerges the other side of this inflation battle, that downtrend will have been temporary. However I do think this stock is being priced to perfection, and the expected growth argument I've seen from multiple bulls is that this price action brings it into line with other big Tech (P/E in the 25 region or so). This growth argument is expecting all of the chips falling Nvidia's way (excuse the pun) over the medium term which in my view is highly optimistic. I can see this stock pulling back back but I think the days of this being a below $200 stock may be over unless economic shit hits the fan.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:19:26'] Hundreds of companies were objectively more overvalued than Nvidia is now less than 3 years ago, so you are being a bit dramatic when you say that you‚Äôve never seen this in your life.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 09:11:16'] I had about 60% of my portfolio in AMD and NVDA and sold right before the earnings... AMA.But seriously, this is Tesla circa 2021 levels of mania. You can be as bullish as it comes to the electric car future and still not value Tesla like it's already making a gazillion cars a year. You can be as bullish as it comes on AI without currently valuing NVDA like it's already cornered the market and is printing money like the Fed. A head start in a new frontier is not a guaranteed thing. If a recession hits, NVDA will be one of the first things investors sell off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:53:21'] Let‚Äôs do the math. The CAGR of datacenter revenue was 51% without a blockbuster use case. We have now have that blockbuster use case. Gross margins are trending towards 70%. Datacenter TAM is $600B, for now there is no substitute for nvidia gpus for AI workloads. If AI is that important can nvidia garner 10-30% of that TAM, then you get $100B in Datacenter revenue, $20 eps, 20-25x earnings multiple. It‚Äôs just that easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:07:36'] AI is already being hailed as the next world-changing technology, a step change from what has come before. As an comparison, think about the invention of the the smartphone and the internet. It's too early to tell who exactly will stand to gain most from the new paradigm, but NVDA is the obvious pick-and-shovels play for investors with a decade plus time horizon. At this point Wall Street basically doesn't care about the current valuation and will buy every dip possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:34:34'] I've been buying Nvidia pretty consistently from 2020 till end of 2022.  I haven't bought more this year.  I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    I don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:35:27'] People said the same thing about MSFT during dotcom.  Even around the "worst" "megabubble" highs.Meanwhile it basically 7x and crushed SPY.  They bet that the internet would permanently alter the course of human history and MSFT would stay at the forefront.They were 100% correct.  Were they early?  Absolutely.  Was their market timing suboptimal?  Absolutely.But were they right and still made tons of money?  Yes.  Does it matter THAT much they bought in the 50s / high 40s vs. $25?  Not really even though it felt like a painful drop.People are betting that this is the horse of the future.  Time will only tell if they end up looking like geniuses or fools but either way humanity will benefit massively from the ridiculous flow of capital to AI.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 13:35:31'] I agree it is massively overvalued and trading at astronomical P/E ratios. I think it might go up some more though before it goes down. I see it finishing the year at around $300 per share although as with anything I could be wrong. I stupidly sold the other chip stock that went up today (AMD) the other week in the $90s although I did sell a majority of my AMD holdings at $155 in 2021. Also stupidly sold NVIDIA in the early 200s towards the end of last year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 13:36:59'] >Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last? I think this is what separates the bulls from the bears on this stock. Do you see this AI boom as a mostly one time pull forward bump, with maybe the need to upgrade every 7 to 10 years? Or is it going to be an insane orgy of technological advancement where every industry/consumer will be constantly crying out for better and faster AI-powered services?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:18:14'] When we drove the interest rate into the ground we violated the cardinal rule of fiat money: it can never be cheaper to borrow than it is to hold. In other words, inflation made the real interest rate drop below zero, meaning borrowing cost nothing and holding money meant you lost money (to inflation).What that did was separate price from value. A thing‚Äôs price no longer reflects what it‚Äôs value is. Hence the spike in trillion dollar companies.None of this is sustainable and when we hit the wall it‚Äôll be brutal
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:32:00'] I actually found this post cause I was just thinking that it feels like we are in a tech / AI bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 20:39:58'] What puzzles me is that AMD is right there with slightly slower GPUs. It's not like NVidia has a monopoly or some revolutionary patented tech.I'm just assuming this is a pure Dotcom-style bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 21:04:07'] It's not.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:18:04'] The market is in a controlled simulation right now. Fundamentals haven't mattered for a long time. If you take notice it is just a bunch of V's. The reason IMO why NVDA is so high is because it allows it to have a larger weight of QQQ. QQQ is forced to go up so this is how they get it done. If you notice they take turns pumping different large tech names on a day to day basis to keep the index up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:31:23'] All of this feels like Japan bubble. Just reading that bubble history on Wikipedia and the similarities are insane with huge property appreciation, bank behavior, and a central bank that decided to tighten too late.  Apple being worth more than UK stock market, NVDA valuation, people thinking DCA into VOO or QQQ will work forever, etc, these are things we may look back on in 20 years and say ‚Äúit was all so obvious it was a top‚Äù.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:12:41'] There is a possibility it is overvalued for a hardware business, but this is one of those where it is not nearly as obvious as everyone thinks it is. You are not looking at future financial profile - not unrealistic to think GMs hit 70% next year with the unprecedented demand. Is it sustainable, who knows?If the AI train is not all hype (and for those paying attention, there‚Äôs reasons to think it‚Äôs not), then this will be downright cheap. If you can provide the raw tools that enable you to create 10 billion workers out of thin air, a 1 trillion valuation will look laughable. Remember, the majority of economic value accrues to businesses which provide the picks and shovels. Even if it is hype, NVDA benefits from hype alone. This is the same issue with those who were screaming TSLA was so overvalued when it was between $100-$500bn in market cap. You have to look at it on a forward basis and be a little thoughtful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:13:03'] I just buy stocks that I like and use in real life. Nvidia make good graphics cards, they will probably dominate the hardware industry once it all moves into the cloud, which I am likely to use. Also AI, I've read about how they're looking forward in that regard and I am using AI more and more. Not much thought past that tbh. I'll be working and investing for the next 40 years, so the recent downtrends will hopefully just be a good time to buy up.  I'm starting with risky stocks, will then move into sectors like recycling and waste management, then ETFs and less risky stocks. Please lmk if this is stupid, I've re-entered investing with different strategies the past few years and this is what I've drawn up so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:12:11'] The idea is that people will need their tech for ai -and people think ai is going to make more money then the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:28:43'] Yesterday, Nvidia‚Äôs CEO Jensen Huang said that as more companies integrate AI, $1 trillion worth of outdated data center equipment would have to be swapped out for new chips. This represents an maybe unheard of market opportunity. So I think the stock price jump yesterday was mostly based on the position Nvidia sits with regards to a potential $1T market opportunity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:32:26'] you are asking the wrong question. Nvidia is not pumping for fundamental reasons. Fundamentally they look terrible. the reason Nvidia is pumping right now is because it is being pumped. the media has been pumping AI all year long and also pumping this idea that Powell is going to pivot nowNvidia is going up because of these 2 things. Its a pump and dump. The media was brought in to pump the story and get retail investor bagholders excited and buy in so the insiders and intstitutional money could get outCathie Wood ARKK sold a shit ton of Nvidia not too long ago precisely because the fundamentals are terrible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 03:03:27'] IMHO Nvidia is only so big as there is was not a serious competitor in the last years. The take over of ATI by AMD in 2006 was the biggest present for Nvidia as AMD started to struggle and started to cut down all R&D budgets leading to about 10 years of development gap between them. But Intel and AMD are making progress so it is possible that Nvidia will not be in that position in a few years anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:09:07'] Nvidia owns the AI hardware market. More AI developers use their GPUs and software toolkits than any other, by a wide margin.The dominant leader in a market tends to support inflated valuations for extended periods of time.Until recently we would never imagine Google losing its dominance in the search market. The lead that Amazon has in being a global marketplace is practically insurmountable. Say what you want about Tesla and competition, but they have an insurmountable lead in software development and the vast amounts of data required to cement their leadership.These "cream of the crop" companies are rare and every institution wants to hold them.Is Nvidia "overvalued?" Sure. It was probably overvalued at $300. And it will be overvalued at $500 later this year.The market decides the value of a stock. The more we get hung up on questioning the rationality of the market, the more we miss opportunities. History shows again and again, long-term market leaders had inflated valuations *before* they made their big runs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 15:53:35'] Honestly, if Nvidia continues its projected huge growth over the next 5 - 10 years it could easily be worth well well over 1 trillion to power the future of technology and AI. Nvidia is a beast and it's expensive for a reason

The issue with NVDA was that they had a huge pull forward of demand, coupled with a historically high valuation and historically high margins. This kind of set up was obviously not sustainable.Selling after that has played out in the price action of the stock obviously not going to work. You have to take a risk and sell while things are ridiculously good, or if you're good, when things look like they're just about to turn.The key to buying NVDA now is anticipating when news might get better and buying before that happens. My guess is that you still have at least another quarter or two of bad news given the macro. That means you probably have some time yet and the valuation is still very high. So just wait. There's no rush to buy a stock that's priced to perfection imo. There's always going to be other times you can buy NVDA at an excessive valuation if that's how you like to play things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 06:11:53'] >It's popular sentiment here that NVDA is overvalued because their revenue has declined.No its overvalued cause they trade at 2.5x historic valuations without 3x the growth rate. Even if without their revenue declining they have 50% to fall

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 06:02:35'] You think there is another 10x in the stock in the next six years? That would make it worth 4 trillion. Doubt it. Find the next nvda. It‚Äôs out there.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:40:20'] Bullish for Microsoft. They way overspent for Activision early on. Then again they still owe $4 billion if the deal fails.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 04:36:11'] Well this certainly isn't the news I was hoping to hear for MSFT. I'm sure Sony is happy after all their crying over this deal. On to the appeal...
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:47:37'] Nearly 300 posts and no one talking about how this is mostly good for MSFT? I mean come on the over pay for ATVI was going to be something like ex their current value. Shit is a sinking ship. Now it is more likely ATVI either goes under or sells off key assets for much less than MSFT was going to pay. It also puts nearly 70 billion back in the bank as we are headed into a potential recession. I would not be shocked to find out many in the C suite are happy to have an out from this deal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:11:58'] Posters here acting either like Microsoft is going to act like a gangster and shut down the entire United Kingdom üòÇ Jesus Christ you shouldn't own stocks if you think this is how business people should behave
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:16:29'] Notice the one analyst that downgraded msft before earnings yesterday was from a British company?  It was dumb and perhaps Britain should be investigating their own companies,
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:38:44'] Lulz Maverick of Wallstreet definitely highlighted an insider trade on his shoe the other night for this one. Someone bought a few million in puts on Activision a day or two ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:11:43'] TLDR: we don't want to risk you not letting Sony have your games. Only Sony is allowed to do that to you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:22:24'] Bullish. Activision was not worth that
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 07:07:44'] Lol anything that they are worried "could" happen that is anti competition, Microsoft could contractually purchase from Activision and Activision could make said changes.  A purchase of Activision isn't required to make titles or series' of games solely accessible in certain ways etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:26:51'] What‚Äôs stopping Activision from making exclusivity deals with MS for their game content to be available on Xbox/PC/Game Pass for some time before PS gets the content?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:07:09'] I think this is another great opportunity to load up. Even if the appeal doesn‚Äôt work, they will just carve out the UK business and leave a small independent company there with licensing deals and a more lenient cloud gaming platform to satisfy the regulators. But I think the appeal will work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:09:31'] Microsoft would not have a monopoly over cloud gaming with this acquisition. This move to block has very little standing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:01:14'] Rip my puts I sold at $80 expiring this Friday.  And the shares I purchased at $85 last wk so I could sell calls at $90.  At least I will make money on the call....but not enough to offset the loss I will have to take.  Fucking UK!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:34:24'] This block has little substance to it.... Sony just does not want to see CoD on Xbox Live....Only concern is around the cloud based gaming... mean look at Stadia...They had no other issues left, they had no concerns over the deal reducing competition etc for consumers...no impact concerns on console sales etc. Seems more like a provoked response to the news of msft proceeding with the deal...yesterday.Believe msft has to close the deal by end of fiscal year 2023 or atvi is owed penalties and it could be open to renegotiating terms of the deal?Will probably add to my position...at this point since I have held since early 2022...Disclaimer: Currently holding 10,400 shares of ATVI at cost basis of $80.12 (purchased Q1 2022).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:14:40'] Sony's just vindictive and mad that MSFT stopped doing exclusives and port lots of said exclusive titles to PC. Sony had no choice but to follow which hurt their console sales despite the titles selling like hotcakes on PC. There's also the Xbox pass vs PS+ issue and many other stuff that had their PR spokesperson slinging shit at each other via news conference and company statement like two teenagers arguing on Twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:57:55'] "hinder competition in the nascent cloud gaming market"That part is asinine. It's a tiny market, and owning or not owning Activision isn't going to stop Microsoft from being dishonest and hurting consumers yet again. It's such a tiny market that it shouldn't be considered when talking about monopolies.Also, Khan praising this saying that mergers and acquisitions always hurt the poor and help the rich is even more asinine. She needs to move to communist China.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 07:36:20'] Britain is always blocking acquisitions until companies agree to give them a slice of the pie.  They are doing the same thing with Broadcom right now.  It's ridiculous. Microsoft will spend money in Britain through various means, making certain powerful people a little more money from their companies, and it will go through.   Think of Britain being the equivalent of Mexican police at road stops.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:55:16'] Microsoft should buy or heavily invest in cdpr. This deal was over priced from the get go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:45:23'] With the Xbox doing as badly as it has against the competition, I'll be very surprised if MS don't just ditch consoles and become a publisher and/or cloud gaming platform entirely. Gamepass is a huge hit on PC and the cloud service isn't bad at all, the later just needs graphical options to turn it up a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 09:00:39'] ‚ÄúTrust me bro it‚Äôs good for the economy, this isn‚Äôt a pro gamer monopoly move‚Äù-Microsoft probably
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 10:51:10'] This is good. Deal was bad for msft. And bad for consumers. COD would go to die after an acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 11:21:33'] Good riddance. Microsoft has acquired many ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù studios and made their games Xbox/pc exclusive. Not making CoD/Candy Crush exclusive to their consoles hardly makes up for all the other games that it has made exclusive to its platforms. I‚Äôm glad they were blocked from this, and hope that their past purchases are scrutinized, too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:53:19'] It's funny how for the past 8 years. Sony has just sat on cloud gaming with PS+ and did absolutely nothing to improve on it.Then Microsoft does it leagues better than Sony within a few years and gets called a monopoly for it even though that title really belongs to Sony.The clownery is real.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 00:19:45'] Why does Europe have a say in this?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:20:43'] How does this even work? Why does a US company acquiring another US company need approval from the UK? What power does the UK even have to stop it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:48:23'] British legislation on Sony‚Äôs bankroll, apparently.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:19:25'] As an ATVI investor, I'm very disappointed by this. I had a sizable profit yesterday so I'm sad to see the stock sink.But as a gamer that believes competition is necessary in the industry, I'm very happy to hear this. Microsoft should not be allowed to buy themselves a monopoly in the gaming industry.So I'm conflicted, but I'm leaning on this being good news overall.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:23:27'] Good, thank you UK.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:52:14'] Holy shit Sony has been doing this crap for over a decade but now they worry Xbox will do it? What the fuck Britain
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:58:52'] I find it hilarious that Microsoft's stock is skyrocketing from this news. Up 8% today.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:28:04'] Microsoft is such a monopoly and has lack of competitiveness that I run out of games to play in gamepass and am considering just unsubscribing until there is something actually good. Meanwhile I am thinking how Sony still has the best games and I am tempted to get a ps5. They really don‚Äôt know the state of this industry at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 04:51:54'] Perfect.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:31:48'] Well, well, well, it looks like Microsoft's big plan to take over the gaming world has hit a little snag! That's right folks, the British too competition regulator has put their foot down and blocked the whopping $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Looks like they'll have to find another way to get their hands on those popular game titles. Will they try to sweet talk their way into a deal or will they simply move on to their next target? Stay tuned to find out!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:34:20'] Good. Of course more monopolization of video games will not help competition. The US regulators should have had the balls to block this acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:49:06'] What are the legal implications? Could they just pull out of the UK market since they are American companies?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 14:09:26'] MSFT is a hegemonic monopoly with some of the creepiest managers I‚Äôve worked with. The company produces mediocre crap like Windows and Office 365 and buys out any competition- the world would be a better place if it was broken up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 19:23:28'] I feel like Microsoft should make its own military shooter that resembles Call of Duty without the Fortnite kiddy stuff like rabbit ears and lame stuff like that. Many people, at least us older folks, have been waiting for such a game for a long time now.Although I have VERY limited expectations for Microsoft after Halo Infinite... And I've been a Halo player since the OG Xbox. It's the reason I got an OG Xbox. They need to get their shit together and make good quality games that, yes, can have microtransactions, but shouldn't be overly greedy altogether. Like Overwatch 2 selling skins for almost $20... for a single skin.And if the acquisition goes through, SONY should bring back Socom but modernize it a bit. Many people will buy it off the bat for nostalgia alone. Hell, even remaster 1 & 2.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:41:45'] Overvalued. That's it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 20:59:51'] The stock market is the only market where people see a sale and run to the exit - WB.Don't buy or sale NVDA because its up or down this week. If you like the long-term prospects of the company, buy a little every week or month over several years, and hold until your view of the company changes.If you want to trade the stock, do it on momentum, not fundamentals. Skilled traders can make a good profit, but most people just confuse their luck with skill.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 23:50:36'] Guidance was lowered. Do you buy the earnings today or the earnings in the future? Right. That's why it went down, because the market is pricing in lower growth + fed pressure.

Means 2022 total year EPS won‚Äôt be net. 44 PE valuation no longer valid.Just to let you know the whole CNBC & Analysts scams are to say, no sp500 earnings are going to be lower but they won‚Äôt. So there is this whole forward PE lie. The PE is actually much higher with the lower guidance. They do this to rationalize that Q3 and Q4 companies can make it up. Also the excuse gives their investment banks cover to unload saying forward PE lie is low. When Q3 earnings can‚Äôt make up the difference then will come the bloodbath.So just beware all scams‚Ä¶ but recession like is never priced in until it actually happens

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 05:51:07'] Are you still holding it? I agree that it's overvalued, you really have to predict insane growth (and a high PE with that) to justify it's current price
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 18:39:22'] Companies that have high R&D spend with high profit margins almost always have high or even negative p/e values. Good examples are **NVDA, AMD, NET, ROKU** etc. All businesses with profit margins of 60% or more and high R&D spend. Due to their high profit margins they can scale and grow earnings faster than other businesses. A business with 70% profit margins that grows revenues by 10% is growing earnings 350% faster than a business with the same revenue but only a 20% profit margin.Profit margins are basically a multiplier on earnings growth. **MSFT** is a good example of a maturing company that has been streamlining their SG&A and R&D spend. From 2018-2021 their revenues increased by 52.5% (18% growth/year), but their EBITDA increased by 80.2% and their EPS by a whopping 377%. As a result, despite having a PE of over 45 in 2018, their PE in 2021 is 37 despite the stock going up by 300% over that time span. Imagine seeing a stock triple in price in 3 years and actually becoming **cheaper** in terms of PE ratio. That's what a maturing growth company does. This is why investors go gaga over companies that grow revenue by 40%+ a year with 60%+ profit margins (which is double what MSFT did over that time span).
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 06:09:31'] NVDA has a rich valuation currently because people expect NVDA to have big demand for their products. When the demand is high, there is a high chance they will also make a lot of money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 06:11:03'] 1. Led by a brilliant visionary CEO , who is also the founder2. Future is AI . Nvidia are miles ahead of everyone.3. They are on path for full stack data center solution, i.e CPU,DPU,GPU . Though their ARM acquisition seems to be failing, they can still execute the plans by licensing ARMThese are the few forward looking reasons.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 10:01:52'] There is a coming revolution in tech that will be powered by their chips.  Ai for consumer robotics, and data analysis is going to explode.  Its like right before smart phones started hitting the market.  Devs will soon start to deliver products powered by machine learning to regular people and nvidia makes stuff that is integral to reducing training times for ai algos.  Some people doubt Ai, but its going to change the market as drastically as smartphones did.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 08:44:21'] The way I see it, a lot of people are considering the future positives of Nvidia to justify the valuation without considering the future positives of their competitors. Right now, Nvidia is top dog in both hardware and software. However, Intel and AMD are coming for them. MI200 was a big step forward for AMD on the hardware end. They're not even close in terms of software, but neither Intel nor AMD are sleeping around.We're going to see very soon what foundation Intel has built in terms of graphics when Alchemist launches and they start getting more deeply involved on that end. Newer technologies like XeSS are skewing towards open source. Intel and AMD are expanding their AI efforts significantly. People who think that Nvidia's lead is insurmountable should also remember that AMD went from a \~$2 billion company facing bankruptcy to a now $170+ billion company with leading edge CPU/GPU performance. As a long time member of the tech community, I remember the days when people said Intel was so far ahead that no other chip designer or fab could catch them. Now look where we are with TSMC and AMD. This used to be unthinkable.The semiconductor industry right now is more fiercely competitive than ever and Intel is finally awake. Nobody knows who will be on top and no lead is insurmountable. It's effectively going to be an Nvidia, AMD, and Intel free for all in the next few years with everybody using TSMC's nodes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 05:45:53'] NVDA has a history of  crashes when its run too hot with demand. See 2018, when demand slowed down due to bitcoin crashing. Stock went down almost 50%.

I‚Äôm afraid if I had it in my IRA I would have sold pre-split free the massive run up it had. Do yourself a favor, buy a few shares tomorrow, a few more when it dips, and few more when it dips more.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 06:24:48'] If the gaming market continues at the current rate and NVDA keeps the same market share, their gaming gpu revenue will double in 5 years. Their data center business generated like $8B in revenue (that‚Äôs a lot!) but their mgmt thinks it could grow to $50-100B in revenue. They have a lot of ways to grow and grow fast. If they do just those two things above the forward PE looks much more reasonable and price targets of $300-400/share are also more reasonable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 07:34:23'] People see areas of growth and potential growth for Nvidia, and so everyone wants to get in early because it could be the next megacap and make people 1000% returns.  Price rises quickly.Others see the price rise, know the positive things around the company, and FOMO kicks in.  Price gets driven higher.Current price is way, way beyond what is currently reasonable, and is deep into speculation territory.  This is common with growth stocks, though is unusual for a more mature company like Nvidia.  The really high P/E (and forward P/E) shows just how much the current price is speculation about future growth, and so there is risk.  If Nvidia keeps growing but that growth slows, the stock price could come tumbling down rapidly.  Doesn't mean they are bad or failing--just that the price has gotten ahead of itself.Same thing happened with so many of the COVID stocks--they are still growing, growth slowed down, share price took a nosedive because they were priced for continued explosive growth.  So I would be very, very careful buying Nvidia.  At this price it is more like gambling than investing.  I think they have a great future and would happily buy...at more like half the current price.  Maybe $200.  At the current price I'll just get my exposure at market cap weight in my index funds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 20:53:17'] NVDA has a tremendous potential since GPUs are better suited for bid data, analytics, IA... processing. It is not about just gaming hardware, GPUs are the future of the large computing business. NDVA has the edge on a business that is going to thrive in the next many years.  More than just growing revenues, NVDA is also leading a technology revolution, is building an ecosystem around its products and is uniquely positioned with many entry barriers.  But you are right in a certain fashion, theses are companies are very interesting too, I am a particular fan of TSM, for and example. But if you want to associate with a great company as NVDA, you will need to pay the price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 06:27:39'] NVIDIA has an opportunity to expand into AI Software - both for industrial/engineering type metaverse and enterprise AI.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 08:45:54'] NVDA is definitely overvalued, but I believe is one of the best overvalued stocks to own. There will be days where it soars and other days where it nosedives. When it nosedives I make sure to buy some more shares. Long term you will be just fine.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 16:01:24'] You are kinda talking about three very different types of semiconductor stocks with mu Tsm and nvidia. Mu is producing chips that can be viewed  as a commodity just simple use basic stuff. Tsm is a manufacturer of the chips while nvda is designing specialized chips. Most importantly they dominate the data processing center vertical. Nvda aso has the software platform to use their chips for ai capabilities that will change the landscape of business as we know it. And throw in partnerships with all kinds of major players for autonomous driving.All the other stocks you named are great ( also look at MRVL) but no nvda and never will be. AMD is the only other player in the data center.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 16:03:43'] High PE (richly valued) stocks are valued that way because they are growing at a rapid rate, often have a unique product or service, and have the potential to reward investors with high returns. They can also blow up. See DOCU, SNAP, ZM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 20:13:23'] Because when Fed tanks rates to nothing and pumps markets with spending money created out of thin air causing inflations stocks go higher... specifically big names like NVIDEA, APPLE, GOOGLE, MSFT, ETC we saw what kind of a run up all these stocks have had from the pandemic sell off to the fed pumping zero rate environment to now.... some of the biggest gains the market history in my opinion in such a short span. You have a vacuum they have created what they did was they sucked all the liquidity that exists and they gave them one viable option to make money... STOCKS.. then they printed money and benefited STOCKS.... see the trend? STOCKS its been all about STOCKS for 2 years now but this is why major players are not predicting a crash or correction because once that vaccuum seal breaks... and liquidity gets sucked back out via higher interest rates or whatever triggers it... surely some retail that joined this investing game recently are going to lose a lot of money. Hedge funds have good entry points on stock long before most retailers do so their price to lose much is much lower lot of them got in the major players 10+ years ago so if a correction happens they could care less its retail that will feel the wrath aka the lower/middle class folks usually.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 13:07:10'] It's a great company, but at least a decade of future earnings growth is already priced in.Look at it this way.  If its earnings were to grow such that its PE at an $800B valuation today matched Apple's, it would be making about 1/3 the profit of Apple.  Is it realistic that the average first world (essentially) person will be providing the same annual profit to Nvidia as Apple? I'm not saying their direct customer bases are the same, they certainly are not.  But Apple's reach and pricing power is enormous.  Ultimately every dollar in revenue a company gets comes from consumers.  If your customers are companies then your revenue from them is a small slice of the revenue they get from their customers, and so on.I don't see a scenario where Nvidia reaches Apple's level of profits or even 1/3 of it in the next decade.  I find comparisons like this useful for trying to estimate the potential profitability for a company.   You could make the best widget or service ever but it has to fit in everyone's budget, possibly displacing something else, to make a ton of money from it.  I think at every late stage bull market most people just aren't considering this at all so valuations get insane.  10 to 15 years later, a few companies will have grown into those valuations, but most won't.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 13:50:35'] Not surprisingly, no one here really answered your question.Regardless of the ticker, when a stock has a high valuation based on todays numbers(pe, trailing pe, trailing eps, trailing fcf, trailing p/revenue etc), one has to look at forward projections.  Basically the stock is priced high because investors feel its future value metrics will come into a reasonable valuation even with a market outperforming stock price appreciation. For example, let's say the SP is expected to average 8% annual returns for the next 5 years. The only reason to buy an individual stock is if an investor expects it to return enough *more* than the benchmark to offset the higher risk of an individual stock holding. So, for me, id need to expect a stock to return 12% for 5 years to justify owning it over an ETF of the benchmark. So, to evaluate of the stock we are looking at is worth the asking price, im going to look at all those value metrics on a forward basis and compare them to the benchmarks forward value metrics. Those forward value metrics are educated guesses, guided by the companies own statements, sec filings and expectations of market analysts. Then, id have to apply my knowledge of the companies sector, to determine where *I* think those metrics will be in relation to the established ones. It's not an easy process, and in reality though they won't admit it, most individual investors are just looking at charts, a few numbers and making a gut decision. When they are right they feel like they are smart, when wrong, they feel like they were unlucky. Neither of which is true, but that's why most people invest in indexes, because trying to get enough knowledge and information about enough individual stocks to form a semi diversified portfolio requires a lot of time and effort. Time and effort have value. Let's say you spend 2 hours a week doing all that work for an 8 stock portfolio AND you are one of the few people who manages to beat the index, take that 2 hours a week, value it at $15 bucks an hour doing some job and investing that 30$ a week extra into an etf, and chances are that outperformance evaporated.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 14:17:41'] High projected growth = high pe values. Imagine you have a money machine that makes 5 dollars day that grows 8% annually. People are probably willing to pay average value of that. Now imagine this same money machine makes 5 dollar per day but grows 20-30%. You're probably willing to pay a premium for the second machine over the first one. Also, not all companies grow at the same rate, some higher some lower. Market dominance probably lowers certain risks. Which people are willing to pay higher to reduce risk.

It's like those magic zoom on TV.I think it's going to affect a lot of fields once they develop the field. I could see a lot of potential in streaming and video making with graphical AI. I am just not sure how it will play out. I just bet on the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 06:32:33'] The P/E ratio that is public is incorrect, I believe this company is undervalued. They have a subscription product which is starts at 9000 per year. They are as of now the leaders is automated driving, oh and not to mention they have a product that never can hit a shelf because it‚Äôs gone soon as it‚Äôs produced. I never seen something that is a used computer component INCREASE in value used after 3 years! The runway for nvda is huge long and girthy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 07:28:36'] Nvidia is a superior company to TPE, AMAT, and MU in most peoples eyes, in many cases, it's better to pay a high price for a great company, than low price, for okay company. A perfect example is Apple and Microsoft in late 2000s, if you purchased back then, today you'd be up significantly, some who bought at a discount, might be up 8-folds, while others up 4-5 folds, but nonetheless everyone won, just a matter of how much. On the flip, less good companies, are pretty much now obscure or no one talks about. Tesla is another perfect example of a stock with extreme valuations, even more extreme than Nvidia, yet still bought consistently. Think I responded to you in another post, but figured would respond here as well for maybe more eyes lol.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 08:53:06'] The largest companies in the world often define the order of the world. It was true in 1989 when Japanese industry dominated the top charts by market cap.This time it's mostly internet properties and the financial engineering around that. So I predicted NVIDIAs growth given their product portfolio and its impact on the frontier of the internet. This is much different than Intel and AMD that improve the current version of the internet.It's the same mental model that I use to predict that Square will be a top company of the world with it's development in alternative internet currency

Ppl won‚Äôt realized about NVDA unless they experience on their gpu performance and color gamut as just one example. And TSLA auto pilot also use NVDA chipset for AI.In your example you mentioned many company‚Äôs those can replace with another company like AMD vs Intel.MU vs Samsung or AMAT. However for NVDA no real competition. They have pricing power just like apple. This one reason UK regular are fearing to sell ARM to NVDA.Compare AMD gup vs Apple vs Intel vs NVDA and determine why company is 800B.+ powerful data centers are run eaither quantum computing or NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 13:44:21'] Growth. A reverse DCF seems to imply recent growth of free cash flow will continue for a decade or more if the current market price is justified. If the growth proves to be less than stunning it won't provide a good return.Personally I think the market is overly optimistic that their success can continue at the same rate. 48% compound annual growth rate for a decade means a fifty fold increase. Can the total addressable market sustain earnings of that scale for a single (even dominant) player?
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 13:52:16'] Try do a DCF. Can talk about how great a company is/isn‚Äôt all day but to see if buying in at its current price is likely to give you better or worse returns than the market, you have to try analyse its future cash flows IMO.

Facebook better load up RAM to power that metaverse!&#x200B;To me it sounds like you aren't sure what NVDA is all about and just hopped on because it was a trending stock.

March Fed meeting, market general volitity from Russia's invasion/nuke threatvasion, and Lapsus hacking 1TB of confidential data from Nvidia.I'm bullish about Nvidia long term, but this ain't it's 2 weeks to shine. Just let the dip happen instead of trying to swim against the current, you'll be much happier acquiring shares at a lower price in the near future.Edit: I posted this a few days back and am adjusting AMD's great value price at somewhere in the 90s, due to a volatile situation with China & Taiwan (TSMC plant).
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 10:05:01'] NVDA if I had to choose one, I'm invested in both though.NVDA is going to be growing its profits at an extreme rate in the next 30 years and is financing that growth purely through profits not debt or equity. Their management is also top notch and very savy in international business as well as technologyAMD just has one of the best CEOs currently in that role and is taking giant bites out of intel and Samsung.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 18:44:56'] AMD projects themselves to earn \~$4 / share this year, while some analyst think they can do $5 / share.   Depending on the PE prescribed, 20 if they still have good runway, 30 if they have really good runway, I would be expecting 20 x 4 = $80 per share at the low end, 30 x 4 = $120 per share on the high end for year end 2022.  If they do EPS $5, then the range would be $100-150 for year end 2022.  I guess you could always look at 2023 and estimate they will make $6-7 / share, but it starts to become hard to know.  I feel AMD may have a bit of a hard cap due to comparison to Intel's market cap. Since it still can't compete with Nvidia's CUDA market penetration, using Nvidia valuation is a bit unjustified.  I would wait till 100 before I buy. But it's pretty hard not to FOMO these past few weeks. And you really can't predict market movements, so it's really what your comfortable with.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 18:51:43'] You‚Äôll be fine with any of them.  Which one will be the best 10 years from now is merely conjecture‚Ä¶too much at play there.  I‚Äôd wait until tomorrow or maybe observe the current events a bit more to get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù price after it drops tomorrow.  Smarter move would be just to buy a chunk tomorrow after the opening sell off.  All of these chip makers are overvalued like most tech, but none of that matters if they are still boosting their share price on your end.  5 years from now is a long time and it‚Äôs hard to say where they will be competitively but I expect them all to be improved.  Intel‚Ä¶.being the least valued and investing heavily into US production(new $20 billion plant being built in Columbus), looks promising way down the road.  Buy some after the sell off tomorrow then buy more as it goes lower.  Don‚Äôt freak if it drops more.  10 years from now, it will be irrelevant.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 13:08:13'] UMC. Without doing a metric ton of fundamental analysis, they‚Äôve got better ratios than AMD and NVDA with about 50% upside potential in the short run. Going off technicals, they were trading within a strong channel until they bounced their head, multiple times, off a $12.60 resistance level before selling off with the broader semis market. I expect them to retest that $12.60 support within the next couple of months, but there are key support levels at $9.51 (should test very soon), $10.20 and $10.85. If they can confirm a breakout above the $9.51 level, it may be a good time to initiate a position with your own profit targets in mind.But then again, I‚Äôve only done a shallow fundamental analysis and am most running off that technicals voodoo.

AI will power our entire civilization in the next few decades and NVDA is creating the road for that.And if they're able to pull of that arm buyout, they will be a serious threat to Intel and AMD, arm SoC's are already threatening x86, with NVDA they can reach the PC space and NVDA will be at the center of it.Besides all that, all GPUs I had my entire life we're GeForce cards. 77% of the steam users use Nvidia cards.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-04 11:28:28'] I bought more AMD today.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-04 10:42:27'] My three favorite are NVDA, AMD, and QCOM. I like QCOM going after IOT of things and the automotive. They are priced pretty cheap and last earnings showed they are still growing. Their CEO, Cristiano Amon, is pretty awesome and has been company since like '95 as an engineer. Snapdragon is pretty rad. NVDA and AMD continue to grow their share of server GPU's. As cloud becomes more important and in continues to grow, both these companies will continue to do well. They are also high margin chips. AMD talked about improving margins back up to 52% next quarter. NVDA with their AI is awesome. You are paying a higher premium, but I think it's worth it for the growth we are seeing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-04 18:48:28'] I have MU and AMD. MU is stupidly cheap. The trend for memory demand is up. If MU drops more because of temporary headwinds, i'm buying more. I think AMD is slightly overvalued at the closing price of 99.42. I bought some at 102 a few weeks ago even though I thought it is slightly overvalued. Didn't think it would drop down to the 80s. But given the potential of the company and great leadership and the industry it's in, I believe AMD will have a great future. Besides AMD is the only company I actually understand about it and its competitive environment. Give me any other company to look at, I would be floundering to even guesstimate a fair value.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 07:15:40'] NVDA and AMD are always champing at the bit trying to get ahead of the other. As such, there‚Äôs always a great ebb and flow between the two. When one pushes ahead, the other lacks behind. If you go long on both, look at who‚Äôs currently doing better. Roll more into the other. AMD was crushing it last year then intel dropped the 10th and subsequently, 11th gen processors and pulled ahead again. My portfolio more heavily favored Intel and I came out ahead. Now its the opposite. Their back and forth has done me well for the last 6-7 years.Edit: champing at the bit** not chomping. Whoever corrected my is absolutely right. Thanks

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:36:29'] I have all four, NVDA, AMD, TSM and Intel. Number of shares in that order. Own both NVDA and AMD for over 5 years so well vested and plan to hold them for long. TSM and Intel are strategic, both are building new plants in AZ which will add to supply chain. With mgmt change at Intc it is possible that it goes heavy in fab business and grow while it may loose market share to amd and nVDA it may increase revenue from fab business. Of course since no one knows what future holds, I am hedging my bets on all four.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:24:36'] Both are good but AMD was much quicker to increase their retail price for GPUs that are in high demand.

If I had to only choose one, for the long term, it would be Nvidia.FYI: I will never buy Intel stock. They screw the pooch way too often.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:17:53'] Long-ish term, AMD. They‚Äôre about to supplant Intel in the server/enterprise hardware market. Short-ish, NVDA. Their acquisition of Mellanox is a big deal for GPU+Nic compute nodes, and if they manage to win the court challenges to their attempted acquisition of ARM they‚Äôll be a juggernaut.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:38:38'] Hedge and buy both. That‚Äôs what I did a few years ago and I‚Äôve enjoyed the gains since.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:57:42'] NVDA and AMD are two of my largest holdings comprising over 25% of my portfolio. Slightly more NVDA than AMD right now just because it's been doing stupid things pre-split. AMD's last couple days might mean it'll catch up soon though.I finally dumped INTC yesterday after way too long.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:07:31'] My semi basket is tsm, nvda, amd, asml, lrcx, klac, and mu
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:52:17'] I would say AMD due to the current market cap and quality of products being released.Nvidia if the stock drops 20-30% would make it worth it. Current valuation is too high, I think next earnings report will bring the stock down to a more fair value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 15:31:03'] NVDA 500bn market cap, almost 20bn annual revenue.AMD 120bn market cap, 10bn annual revenue.NVDA eps is 5x better, but I like AMD growth prospect.From a technical standpoint, $100 break should really send AMD. NVDA otoh should pull back after the split July 19.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 16:10:46'] AMD - They are clearly making big moves for the future right now to be a huge competitor. Lots going on. I believe in their current leadership. I think Nvidia is too complacent.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 02:19:20'] Both for different reasons;**NVDA**: For AI & SoftwareNvidia spec'd hard into AI and is leading the charge here (see Nvidia Canvas, Nvidia Video Compression)**AMD**: Because Intel is ded/dying/not competitive on client (laptop, desktop) or data center (server) Intel still has a large share of desktop/server and AMD can & will capture those; so should continue to grow...

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:15:18'] Either/both I‚Äôd say, AMD are trying to capture existing market share for growth, nvidia are diversifying into new areas for growth, while still competing/leading their current mainstays.If you rope Intel into this, that would be the one I would dump of the 3, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much direction there for long term explosive growth despite great profits milking tried and true methods.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:01:46'] Correct answer would be ASML since none of these companies would exist without it, it makes the equipment for all these companies that make chips
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:04:19'] AMD as they already blew intel out of the water and now have their sights on gpu's.  Nvidia has been king shit for ages so competition will do them good. I think the 6000 series really caught up to Nvidia on the gaming side (not so much on the high end for editing and rendering). One more generation and they could fully catch up/get ahead in some areas.  I like both but I think Nvidia needs something innovative to get me to want to invest more than I have. Still a great option though.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:08:31'] AMD for the short term (now - 1 year).  NVDA for the long term (foreseeable future - years).  NVDA has so much patented technology and many plans that have yet to be released.  With the ARM acquisition looking more positive, those synergies will provide an upside to earnings potential - particularly in the area of data center computing.For now, AMD continues to eat INTC‚Äôs lunch and will continue to do so for the next 2 - 4 years.  Why not invest in both (AMD & NVDA)?

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:41:24'] Intel
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:42:20'] Neither... but only right now.  Right now I would rather own the SEMI CAPS which are trading at very low P/Es on the back of a historical CapEx spending cycle in Semis.  Within the next year or so, I would then move into both AMD and NVDA as the upcoming increased capacity (particularly at the sub 10nm process node) means AMD and NVDA both will have enough supply to sell as many chips as their customers want.  Then both AMD and NVDA can proceed to finish murdering Intel's chip design arm in the data center.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:44:23'] AMD. NVDA GPU market share is not sustainable. RDNA2 being Zen moment for AMD Graphics.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 06:55:46'] Fuck em grab some INTC/s
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:28:35'] NVDA by far, NVDA is huge, its got the name and AI behind it, it has the 'cool' factor. I bought NVDA just a few months ago for $500 now its already past $800 while AMD has been at $85 for as long as I remember.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 07:09:35'] amd.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 08:57:26'] AMD for sure, I personally use their processors and they have a high degree of performance while still maintaining a relatively competitive price compared to the rest of the chip makers in the industry
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:59:19'] Waiting for that "INTEL IS UNDERVALUED!!" guy to come in anytime now....
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 09:02:22'] Both but slightly favoring NVDA. Because once they get their arm cpu running it's gonna change the cpu landscape. I would bet good money it'll give apple silicon cpu a run for it's money
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:00:51'] Imo I think $AMD still has lots of growth and room to achieve!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:23:40'] My favorite is ASML. Why compete? Be a monopoly all down stream chip makers can‚Äôt do without
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:43:48'] Can someone explain how nvda will grow more, since the stockprice is like $ 800.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:30:54'] Valuations of both are quite high so I wouldn't buy, but in my opinion, I would watch Nvidia cause its the cheaper of the two.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 07:42:34'] amd, nvidia mooned already

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:10:53'] Look at what nvda has done from day 1, AMD will absolutely have similar growth.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:44:23'] Both in my opinion while they are in the same sector they are in different focuses. Already saw AMD going up today by a good percentage amount and that's held steady. Nvidia just continues to go up and is a sure thing I would say. Hard to say which will go up more than the other
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:02:24'] They both have good prospects given the direction of the industry. I like AMD and I'm going to buy in more soon because they have a lot of room for continued growth.I'd like NVIDIA more if they weren't so expensive (both the stock and the GPU's)
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:34:34'] I like both, but I have 61 stocks so obviously have a problem choosing favorites lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:44:38'] Yes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:56:09'] both good. why just one of them?get both of them and sell your intel if you have.no financial advise.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:37:03'] Why not both?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:23:47'] NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:50:34'] Is AMD planning on pushing into the GPU/AI space? Is NVDA planning on pushing into the ULSI space? If the answer to either of these questions was yes then there would be a point in asking which one to favor. But the answer to both of those questions is no.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:50:42'] Both, and I have been in both since 2015. I've trimmed my NVDA holdings over the last month with the spike since PE is a bit exuberant and they are very exposed to crypto, regardless of what they would like to project.If you must buy only one, get XLNX due to favorable SP ratio. Will see 10% ish upside if merger goes through, which it should.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:58:16'] What about other semis like MU?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:06:06'] Buy NVDA before split and start selling covered calls after the split for income.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:13:35'] both
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:19:08'] Buy both 50/50
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:24:01'] I keep waiting for Nvidia to have a bad week or even just a day to get in before the split but it's too damn high up 55 perc over 3m and 25 on the month alone feels like the dam will break after the split and will see a mass sell off so I'm waiting unless I can get in closer to 700
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:25:58'] AMD is a stock that has never played the way I wanted

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 15:02:02'] Own both!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 15:03:31'] NVDA. We may hear more about their graphics cards, especially if you're a gamer. But they have so much going on with AI, robotics, cloud computing, nanotechnology, etc. But AMD will probably keep taking market share from Intel for at least a couple more years. However, they're way behind NVDA in all those other sectors that will see huge expansion in the future.

On top of all of that, look at Apple going to ARM based CPUs and that there's all this talk of NVDA picking them up.They are positioned really well in so many ways. I have massive respect for AMD and have very good hopes for them long term, but NVDA has solidly future proofed themselves.\* I do not hold positions in either stock as of 2021

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 19:08:16'] i own both, more invested in NVDA, however i think AMD can blow up
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 19:27:55'] I've been a huge fan of Nvidia for a long time. With their recent runup in price I can't really speak to whether their stock is a good buy in the short-medium term, but in terms of their technology (their software gets overlooked IMO) I think they're going to be one of the most important companies of the next 20 years.But I'm just a tech guy that's highly excited about all the incredible work Nvidia is doing, and their vision for the datacenter revolution (which other companies are finally catching up on, as evidenced by the rise of smartNICs and other DPU solutions)
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 19:54:14'] AMD
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 19:59:17'] I see AMD as having way more growth potential. It has what, a 5th of the market cap and a way better P/E ratio as compared to NVDA. I also feel like (and this is merely speculation) NVDA is due for a dip or a slight correction after it‚Äôs insane growth for Q2 where as AMD has been trading sideways for the better part of a year and is due for a rally. Combine that with a relatively low IV (at least when I checked it about month when I purchased a LEAP) plus the fact that recent stock splits seem to rally immediately following the split and then tank for some time after ( think AAPL & TSLA) and I think AMD is the clear winner here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 20:00:27'] Both.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 20:37:46'] Actually the way to play it is go long on SOXL. It will be on a tear this next month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 22:47:14'] AMD for the future of software implementation. NVIDIA is top dog for the balance of both hardware and software, however AMD implementation of Ray Tracing lighting through software is brilliant.Look back at the 90s for dedicated hardware which was beaten through software effects. I see AMD with a larger percentage to grow while Nvidia becoming stable in the short term. In the next decade I hope AMD invests into quantum processor's. A new Renaissance as software lags behind software requiring operating systems to be repurposed accordingly. Bitcoin may become obsolete as it will be possible to break any Hash or chains. Inverse cryptography companies will see a huge boom for new security protocols. Off the rabbit trail, but a Quantum Bubble market sounds cool.

But that's not happening tomorrow and by the time it does Nvidia will have grown anyway. That said I wouldn't invest in Nvidia for purely personal reasons. Terrible company that treat their customers like fan boys they can do anything to and push as much proprietary BS into the market as possible. And I say that as one of their customers/victims.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:54:14'] AMD I‚Äôve seen their growth trend they won‚Äôt be stopping anytime soon, also very affordable

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 11:27:22'] Both great stocks, I think AMD does have a bit more growth to come than NVDA. NVDA has most of its growth calculated in the current pricing where AMD is still underneath its all-time high.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 01:58:43'] My cousin used to work at Inacom (1991-2000).  Out of the blue he called me bawling on New Year's Eve 1999 that the boss ("who has been like a father to me") shit canned him and a few of his close-knit team.  Forced them to cash out all their stock holdings with the company after years of getting huge stock bonuses.  Good sized severance package (paid cash for a house in Boston).   But he was just devastated that he was going to be robbed of all the future money those stocks were going to generate.   When he got home, there was a recording on his answering machine from his bosses' wife Deanna to call a guy out in Boston for a job- I think it started around $200K at the time and was paying $400K when he moved on a couple years back.   Oh, the punchline was 6 months after he was let go, Inacom filed bankruptcy and the remaining employees didn't get dick.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 06:38:20'] Plenty of cloud software and meme stocks have been smoked since 2021, the big boys like NVDA, CRM, NOW, TSLA and some others are still riding this out but also down about 50% from those highs.  There‚Äôs a lot of software still at 20xs sales.  Every crash is different, market seems frothy again but dont get caught thinking every tech stock will get wrecked like 2000/2008.  NVDA at >$700B on massively declining revs is a joke though but their ceo is a master of hype.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 07:24:28'] There was a fantastic video by a guy (alleged) who rode some stock price up and up and then down during the dot com boom. He had options at the company he worked for maybe it was Sun I thought it was Cisco, I haven't been able to find it again. It went like "oh, nice stock options whatever" "hey I can check the price online now" "huh, looks like I can buy a nice car" "wow, I can get a really nice house" "wait a minute I can get a vacation house too" "Jesus, I can buy another house in another country" "Holy Shit I can make a difference in the world, I can have a foundation, intergenerational wealth" "Hang on it is just taking a breather" "It's got to come back up" "If I sell now I will have lost so much money" "please stop" "I'm going to vomit" "................" "Oh well, the stuff dreams are made of"What is fascinating is that he never cashed any of his options, it was like a study in cognitive bias or something. I wish I could find that video.

Some of the good stuff I recall.... I was on the hockey team and they paid for our ice time, our gear, stick allowance etc.  In the office you could wear shorts, flip flops, bring your dog in with you for the whole day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 06:35:26'] I'm not advocating for buying NVDA in the slightest but it's very possible for revenue to increase quickly, thereby reducing the P/S ratio. NVDA nearly tripled its revenue in two years from the start of 2020 through the end of 2021 so it's not unfathomable to think that could happen again if the macroeconomy allows it. AMD is a much more reasonable buy in my opinion though if you're going for an "overpriced" chip company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:36:51'] I think you‚Äôre wrong. The ability for AI to input and analyze a ridiculous amount of information at once could change the world. It‚Äôll pick up patterns that no human ever could and retain more information than we can even imagine. The ‚Äúcool toy‚Äù is doing what it‚Äôs supposed to and learning from every interaction. The ‚Äúcool toy‚Äù is also not where I see the real potential of this product
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:55:33'] Just like how the internet was tech hype in the 90s and now we‚Äôre using it for this discussion?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:59:44'] I disagree. it‚Äôs definitely stupid to think they can do anything on their own, but for software development it takes on the work of interns already. Give it clear, small tasks and you‚Äôll need to monitor much of it, but it has increased my productivity already by 20-30% and I don‚Äôt get depressed by having to write brainless repeating patterns that are too complex for copy paste. I feel much more in the Control Center thinking about higher level algorithms, while ChatGPT is implementing that for me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:56:17'] I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to be upset with AI/LLMs because execs are morons and are jumping the gun with firing/pivoting. The tech hype bubbles you mentioned all had one thing in common: they didn‚Äôt solve any real problems. I have railed against all of them for being worthless. But with AI it is very easy to see how it can be useful, even if it‚Äôs not perfect right now. There are issues I have today that Chatgpt can help with (coding, summarizing subjects). People shouldn‚Äôt be using them in a court of law, and companies shouldn‚Äôt be thinking they can already replace most employees, but it is not hard to see that one day it might be possible.Within the next ten years I think it‚Äôs very possible that we see a decline in the rate of growth of certain jobs because of LLMs making good employees even more productive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:25:17'] The more I have used it, the less I have liked it. My experience is that it tells you summarized results with great confidence. I have frequently been given wrong or incomplete context on searches. The best way I can describe AI right now is that it is the ‚Äútik tok‚Äù of searching. You get quick and short results, but it lacks substance. I am sure the tech has some meaningful use but honestly I am not overly impressed
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:57:30'] This is definitely a bubble indeed but I don‚Äôt think AI is just a passing fad like the other things were.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:07:16'] Working at a contracting firm, I‚Äôve seen firsthand accounts of ChatGPT/ basic AI bots being implemented in a wide range of industries. The best analogy in it‚Äôs current state imo is to autonomous driving. At the low end for daily office work, report summaries, marketing, admin, etc, ChatGPT is the single most valuable business technology since the internet. At the high end for legal cases like the one you cite, it‚Äôs buggy and years/decades away from being reliable. Mainly because it‚Äôs freeware that doesn‚Äôt have optimized access to company workflows.I agree AI is being touted far too often as a magic wand, similar to other bubbles. But while the hype is overblown, there is a very definite value add from it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:47:14'] >In a few months, people will realize chatbots are cool toys & imaginary drunk friends to chat with & nothing more.OP in December 1903: "In a few months, people will realize the Wright Flyer is neat glider to play around with for a few hours and nothing more". 50 years after the flight at Kitty Hawk, we were walking on the moon. Are you realizing say that because the tech is flawed now that it will always be? Like a year ago the public AI image generators were putting out fuzzy garbage and now you can fully generate anime girls and we have prototypes for generating videos. You're making a VERY body statement about tech that could advance lightyears in the next decade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:12:01'] Idk we‚Äôve created hundreds of billions of gigabytes of data since the internet became a thing. We now have a tool that can sort through this data and output something of value. All while learning how to do it better than before in the process. The applications do seem kind of limitless with a technology that can learn off itself in this way.Remember the internet was also just a fad at one point but ended up changing the world. There may well be a bubble similar to the dot com bubble but I think AI in general is definitely here to stay.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:27:37'] My husband is a software engineer, he uses AI for boilerplate and that's about it. Sometimes people show up for interviews at the company and type the questions they give them into chat gpt. I think people doing stupid shit like fraud, circulating stuff like ai generated photos of attacks on the pentagon, and other goofy BS will lead to AI getting regulated into a hole. I of course can't say for sure, but sooner or later people are going to start using it for nefarious shit like election misinformation, and I can't see that going well. I'm just speculating, I missed the boat on ai and am sorta watching and learning from afar. Only started investing this year, so please do not take what I say seriously x)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:41:53'] AI will probably change the world, but it will also probably be a casino for investors in the meantime. I love growth stocks but try to stay away from hype bubbles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 16:03:36'] OPs point is not that AI is useless, but drastically overhyped and misunderstood. It will obviously be useful in many ways but the internet itself had a very real bubble and is obviously still a great thing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 21:34:40'] There is hype for sure. It‚Äôs not the dot com bubble though. It legit has a disruptive future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:17:45'] This is why they say - you need to make sure to invest in the stuff you understand. Calling current generative AI technology a hype is an underestimation of its impact that you can already see in the industry every day, with tasks taking days, now being reduced to hours of work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:35:35'] That‚Äôs a real ignorant post.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:57:46'] LLMs like ChatGPT aren‚Äôt even real artificial intelligence. They‚Äôre chat bots. They don‚Äôt think for themselves. They generate outputs based on inputs. They don‚Äôt really ‚Äúlearn‚Äù they catalogue.We‚Äôve basically all collectively agreed in the last year or so to start calling an index of random information ‚ÄúAI‚Äù because it forms it into legible sentences. What a joke.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:40:18'] On a related note, [LexisNexis has released](https://www.lawnext.com/2023/05/lexisnexis-enters-the-generative-ai-fray-with-limited-release-of-new-lexis-ai-using-gpt-and-other-llms.html):> a new product that uses large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, to answer legal research questions, summarize legal issues, and generate drafts of documents such as demand letters or client emails.I think if GPT gets a layer of professional prompts with legal rules in mind, and is limited to a database of actual cases (i.e. searching through Nexis instead of the entire web), it can probably be a lot more helpful. But yeah, that guy/firm sounds like a dumbass.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:40:30'] Wow, very human. ‚ÄúInvented cases that do not exist and asserted they were real‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 18:11:56'] Wrong. Once GPT4 blew up in popularity they adjusted the backend in order to be able to deal with the sheer quantity of new users and clicks. So they dumber the entire thing way down and put so many checks and balances on it during that period both to presumably save on processing power and to save on the potential for scary headlines during a sensitive phase of their development.GPT5 is already in development and whilst it has major fundraising obstacles to get over, once it's released not only will the entire idea of AI be more mature and less vulnerable to exploitation/manipulation, the thing will be several orders of magnitude more powerful. Meaning more processing power, smarter AI, and likely Microsoft involvement (backend support) due to their hefty investment.AI is definitely going to be the future. Just during this phase it's still in development and not ready for widescale every day implementation. Everything you type and say into current iterations is being thrown into the next version to help it develop and learn, remember that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:32:09'] You‚Äôre not correct. For context, I‚Äôm in tech as well but have been using some LLM technology for a while now. Bard / ChatGPT are also used frequently in industry, and LLM based auto complete functionality ( GitHub Copilot ) are used somewhat prolifically in the industry.I think you‚Äôre completely wrong as in all of those other fads, there weren‚Äôt clear use cases. There are already use cases used every day by working professionals who are using this tech productively, which is very different than everything else you mentioned.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 19:10:38'] Everything is in the process of being automated. The speed in which AI is going to change our world is moving faster than our imagination. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but the leaps every year are going to become terrifying. I would not underestimate the power of artificial intelligence.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 19:14:52'] I was skeptical too but AI changed my workflow almost overnight. It's not some novelty that I used for a week then forgot about - it's genuinely part of my workflow now. That was when I realized this is for real.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 19:47:57'] "A tool that will give you highly unreliable information and you have to triple-check everything it says is useless for meaningful productivity and won't change the world either."You're objectively wrong about this. ChatGPT requires clear directions and guidance, and it isn't great at every possible task, but the things which it does well it does VERY well. I use it daily and can count on one hand the times it has been incorrect about something. It doesn't go as deep on certain issues as I'd like, but I actually don't need it to do that in order to save me a lot of time.You are painting too broad a stroke on this one, and because of that you're wrong.Another place you go wrong is in assuming that everything which hasn't been implemented in daily life yet is a failure. Things take time. Blockchain for example is far from "bullshit" as you say, but it is experiencing growing pains as EVERYTHING does. It sounds to me like you aren't knowledgable in the area of tech and how processes play out. These things aren't miracles, they are highly complex structures that take a lot of time to reach their most useable, efficient, and understandable forms.

Getting discounts with your rewards programs and those rewards providing data to brokers so other companies can know more about you?  Linking you social media accounts to rewards or online shopping program for even more cross consumer identification?  If that isn‚Äôt going toward a metaverse I don‚Äôt know what is.The bullshit that Facebook cooked up?  It‚Äôs a half baked product on an existing concept that got pushed out too fast.  Computer assistance in creative work and daily task?  That‚Äôs something we have been working on for many years and it‚Äôs an eventuality.  Again what we have now is over exaggerated and not to anywhere we need them to be yet, but it‚Äôs another eventuality that the interconnected world created by the internet was leading to.Even NFT I would say can have real world usage.  Easiest one I can think of is for event and venue tickets.  Think of digital season passes to sporting events where you sold a single event pass to someone and a NFT can verify that this person is indeed the person to attend this game for this day only.AI and metaverse is not bullshit nor hype.  It‚Äôs undercooked at the moment, but will be as integrated in our society like the Internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 22:08:58'] You seem to assume AI is just LLMs. It‚Äôs so much more than that. And even within the context of LLMs, I disagree that it is all hype with no practical use.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 22:50:33'] The public AI is still young. In future where AI are personal, and trained by individuals, companies, or researchers/professionals, they will be much more useful. Imagine a personalised AI that follows you from young. It will be able to help you do what you want according to your wishes. The public AI is shared now, so the results are not that great and inaccurate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 22:51:23'] The hype is overly optimistic and the pessimists are equally wrong. LLMs are genuinely groundbreaking tech. They are also not ready for most applications that they will be ready for eventually.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 23:52:54'] Have you checked out other forms of generative AI? Products like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly have just been around the corner, but are already doing things that would otherwise cost much more time and resources.While NFTs and crypto were basically nothing else than a huge distributed append-only database situated in an ecosystem full of con artists, generative AI is actually able to perform actual work. Overhyped? Possibly at this moment. But I would not discredit the actual effects of generative AI at this moment.

Generative AI did make huge leaps with GPT 3 and GPT 4 but people are still vastly overestimating what it's capable of doing now or in the near future. It is not going to be a suitable replacement for most jobs and using it for something like a lawyer is just asking for trouble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:47'] The hype wrt hardware is overblown, yes, because once the models have been trained the hardware is no longer needed. But the practical applications of AI just keep increasing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:48'] What industry do you work in? I'm in tech and AI has been prevalent for quite a while. IBM Watson has been implemented by banks to identify fraud patterns, customer Service uses chat bots, Legal Tech is doing discovery entirely with AI and not using paralegals anymore, hell even sports technology is embracing AI to predict injury recovery. It's going to be as big of a deal as the internet was. For this reason, I'm buying cloud storage stocks everywhere I can. The amount of storage required to have enough data for AI to create models from is going to be enormous.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:26:33'] I think "over-hyped right now" is the correct phrase. Because in the long run, like with other tech hypes, they eventually came to live up to it. And AI will too. Chat GPT won't just be a cool conversational engine that works half the time; it will work all the time without the need to use precise language. You could just speak naturally like: "hey who was that actress in that action movie where she did x, y, and z and had the hots for Johnny Depp?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:44:39'] A bunch of people who have no idea how to leverage a tool, coincidentally do not have the brain space to consider actual use cases for AI.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:18:52'] Where you're wrong is that you see the primary market for these things as just consumer chatbots.  The \*actual\* market for these things is corporations, which will have much more tightly controlled data sets and learning programs to train them for the tasks they need.  Some yahoo lawyer trying to get paid for skipping out his job (and rightfully going to suffer for it) isn't indicative at all of the direction the tech is headed, because he's not the actual market for the product anyway.  Also, these devices are the worst they will ever be.  I first was learning about them in 2005 and \*never\* would have guessed they'd be where they are today in terms of advancement, and all of that was done with very little public awareness, as it will continue to do after the public loses focus again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:33:26'] AI is already being used to come up with new medical treatments, or even ways to detect cancers/diseases earlier than doctors are able to detect them. The implications of AI are so much bigger than Chat GPT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:33:36'] ChatGPT is a impressive work but unless you understand what is under the hood you will think is intelligent. Far from the true, the reason it seems intelligent is because it uses all the internet data to come up with the most likely ‚Äúcorrect answer‚Äù to the user question, but is past data meaning it has no idea what is a coming without human data entry.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:40:27'] 1. It will continue to improve.2. That lawyer was just an idiot for not proofing the documents.  3. For lawyers that aren‚Äôt massively stupid, it eliminates having to pay a junior associate to do the rough draft and you just proof read and CHECK THE CASE LAW to ensure it‚Äôs correct, then make any edits before you file it. 4. In other words, it won‚Äôt eliminate all legal jobs immediately, but it is already eliminating the need for a lot of entry level positions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:39:19'] Sure I can pass the bar if I had a set database I can access at anytime and search. Sure. Why not. It‚Äôs like an open book test but with faster searching. Yes that‚Äôs the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:58:43'] Your analysis is a laughing stock for the billions in cybercrime that will be made by using AI + deepfakes to phish and extort people in the coming years. No one really cares about chatbots or essay generators. AI can already mimic someone's unique voice after analyzing a few spoken words. Follow the (dirty) money. BTC is stronger than ever and it's not because you can maybe sort of buy a pizza with it. It's strong due to its illicit use and it's growing.Also, ChatGPT is Google 2.0. It's not the T-800. It's next-gen search engine because can tell you what you should be doing with the information and even list it out in steps instead of just presenting a dump of web results to you. That's something.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 13:27:11'] I disagree. AI will only get better and become more applicable. I do think some names are running ahead of their legs but that's always been the case with new tech.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 13:29:57'] Wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say it‚Äôs like the others but I will say its potential will not be realized overnight like people imagine. It‚Äôs in it‚Äôs infacy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 14:58:54'] AI is going to replace management at a bunch of retail outlets once all the different types of machine learning are hooked up together correctly. Everyone will hate it and it will make them outcompete everyone around them so using it will become mandatory. It will change the world and it will take over the economy, but it‚Äôs also a bubble right now. You still want to buy as much as possible. Hold it for fifteen years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 00:16:29'] This is what I initially thought but it‚Äôs plain wrong. The power is with combining the language model with things like image detection. Also accuracy is not as useful or even as attainable as you wish it was.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 14:11:11'] I say play the whole industry with an ETF. It‚Äôs pretty clear the semiconductors are only going to be more and more important as time goes on. They are the physical underpinning to the entire digital world so whether that‚Äôs CPUs, GPUs, ASICS, EPYC, something else, you can get all the exposure.You limit upside but you massively limit downside and IMO probably gonna be market beating over the next decade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 20:03:25'] My picks are NVDA, INTC and ASML.ASML seems like the safest of them all to me. It's based on Europe so it has little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly. Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.I like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.NVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 14:21:18'] Honestly seems like there is room for everyone.Takes about 2-4 years just to build capacity. But the TAM just keeps growing.Even UMC, TXN, Global foundries making older nodes have max capacity and selling out.But if I had to pick 5.My picks are QCOM, NVDA, MRVL, AMD and INTC.TSMC should be higher liken$150+. But geopolitical risk just doesn't let it go up. So I don't have it.Samsung would work too. But can't really buy it stateside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 14:06:22'] I think Intel is becoming a catalyst in the sector's advance because their intended expansion into the foundry business already is driving investments by TSMC and others in order to position themselves for competing with some of their advanced capabilities and this trend will only gain momentum going forward. I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.    I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it.

If it's a long-term investment, now is probably one of the better times to invest in NVDA, but as an NVDA stock holder I am nervous about earnings next week. That said, I'm not worried about the stock long-term. If I were planning to buy now I'd probably put in 50% before earnings then put in the rest if it drops.If this is a short-term earnings play, I wouldn't do it.

There are factors which no one can predict, like the macro economy conditions, inflation, monetary and fiscal policy, climate change.

Look for it to go up 100%. 50% up even if no war breaks out. The only question is if ET hits 15 or $20. Oil companies are already to pre covid highs. Oil transfer companies are lagging due to Biden shutting down pipelines but he can't do it anymore or they know dems will suffer in fall elections. Energy transfer companies are the only stock now I own. Rest are overpriced and will crash. Might buy a few stocks back if Russia pulls back but not too then.

Last couple of times I have tried using Advance Auto Parts (and AutoZone) they have not had what I needed in stock nearby. It has been cheaper and faster to order parts online from Amazon or RockAuto. The only advantage these stores have is instant gratification of having something I need immediately. Without that they lose there edge. And this is not even taking into account quality which I feel is better at many online retailers versus Advance. Now I normally just order parts online unless I need something for an emergency and even then I am normally let down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 01:38:41'] I think I'm the reason this happened, my story isn't unique.  In 2012 I went to the car store and bought a brand new Fiat 500, with 0% interest.  I drove that car for 10 years and put 120K + on it.   It worked out to $289 a month for the loan.  The only thing I ever did was change the oil like 10 times, replace the starter, and replaced the battery maybe twice.  The clutch stared going out a few months ago, but replacing it was tricky and the labor exceeded the value of the car, basically making it scrap.  I never bought any parts for it at auto parts stores.At the same time I have a 1991 Chevy van.  The odometer was broken when I bought it 20 years ago.  I'm on my second transmission/ going on my 3rd engine.  Other than the two major assemblies, I haven't bought parts for it eitherI guess things last a long time, and if labor is expensive, the car gets scraped and you can go get a new one, unless it's a Chevy van, then just get a new motor or whatever and bolt it in, except you probably don't want yr new motor from Auto Zone, which is why stock is down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:20:22'] According to CNBC, this matches analyst consensus. But according to AH, the market definitely expected a beat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:11:38'] I must admit I am somewhat surprised that Tesla has had to cut prices so much and get reduced margins already.  I thought they had a couple more years of being able to run wild before really having to adjust so much to face stiffer competition.  If that's the case already, then you have to wonder how things will look when more of the big boys really start to ramp up production.Anyway I likely never will own any Tesla equity directly (only through index funds) because their share price is never rational.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:15:27'] I think it's important to put this in the context of other car companies.Ford, for instance, is selling every EV they make for a loss.

Say it‚Äôs crap and the customers are dumb. Meanwhile they dominate the ev market after they made the ev market. There is no competition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:13:16'] It‚Äôs a premium auto manufacturer. They sell cars marketed towards the crowds of high income, loves to be on the cusp of lifestyle tech. The gigantic layoffs from big tech the past 6 months of course were going to hit in their biggest demographic.Tesla is a car conpany. Electric propulsion, Ai powered cruise controls are cool features they have a narrow lead on, not any exclusivity. Legacy auto will be more than ready to keep its market share when the electric car buying really ramps up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:29:22'] Overreact and sell if you want to. I'll be buying at the lower prices. In a few years time Telsa will be still be increasing production, cutting costs, and announcing new factories. The competition will be fighting to sell a significant number at profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:35:24'] unit growth and topline is still good considering amount of price cuts seen. but huge drop in GM/OM. Big question is CT launch. Its April and they are just saying later this year. Dont think CT will have any impact on top line this year. Plus with no M2 for another 2 years(if we have to wait for Mexico GF to go online) at minimum, I think growth will stall unless they decrease price even more which is hard to see with the margins seen.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 02:54:20'] Many of these companies have significant moats with solid growth prospects. I prefer to have several stocks across the spectrum of the semiconductor supply chain with my picks being among those listed below:Semiconductor Equipment: AMAT, LCRX, ASML, KLAC, STMFoundries: TSM, Intel (maybe UMC)Fabless: AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, BroadcomMemory/Logic chips: Micron, Samsung, Intel&#x200B;Others worth mentioning: MRVL, ON, AOSL, SIMO.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 08:49:26'] Let me tell you a little secret. There's a company in the space that not many people have heard about (if you invest in the PSI ETF then you have a small exposure to them). That's why they are flying under the radar and really under valued in my opinion. Ticker is MKSI. Buy now and thank me later. (not a financial advice, invest on your own risk, don't invest money you cannot lose).Not a sexy name like Nvidia or AMD, so don't expect them to go to the moon. But I see them doubling in value in 1-2 years. It's currently 97% institutional owned since retail don't know about them.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 01:07:26'] Who knows.. a lot is already priced in. Intel is probably a good buy, too. Without decent valuations even the best company can be a bad investment.Intel now has such a low valuation that even in a bear case scenario (they keep losing market share etc) you will likely still make some money. On the other hand, if Nvda or Amd do not deliver what they promised, you will likely lose money. It is that simple: value, risk, margin of safety

And NVDA is basically the ONLY name in GPUs, like yea you can buy something else to save yourself money if building a system, but in all likelihood you'd still be better off just buying a cheaper NVDA gpu then some other name brand, shit I can't even think of any off the top of my head.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 06:43:57'] 10 years ago no one of these companies was a good investment. But 10 years later it was. I think you are getting it wrong. You should pick stocks that you think would be great in about 10 years. I don't want to give you any advice on that part - but I don't think these companies would be a sure winner in 10 years - I do think however they would peak in the next 1-2 years.I'm currently holdning ASML and NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 12:37:54'] Yes. AMD will be a $500 stock within the next few years. I'd go into AMD instead of NVDA because NVDA seems a little overbought right now.Another option to consider is CRSR for gaming. A lot of people are ignoring the gaming boom that is--and will continue--to take place over the next few years. CRSR will be dominant.Also, PLTR is a very good one. I'd say any software or technology company that isn't a scam is a good buy. PLTR has recently been listed publicly, but they've been in business for years and have very respected executives leading that company. &#x200B;IMO: PLTR will 10x and AMD will 10x at least within the next 10 years. It could possibly happen sooner if we get this chip shortage fixed and get people back to work whether in the office or remotely.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 09:53:47'] Gonna be the voice of decent and say that seeing tesla starting to develop their own in house processors that it will only continue to become more feasible from a fabrication perspective as technologies like RISC-V become more mature and more economical  due to the increasing  scale of the integration we will see less reliance on traditional semi conductor manufacturers. I still think those stocks have plenty  of room for growth and a rising tide can lift all boats but they just may not grow to the extent you are hoping and I see a substantial  shift in how production is handled in the near future.

It was 5G that they have an edge over all others (especially when US banned Hauwei).   Just becareful with QCOM as they have been close to ARM reference design in the recent years.

POST_TEXT: b"I just stumble upon some information in regional newspapers that I didn't pick up in international news about the semiconductor sector: both the CEO and CTO of ASML will be leaving in 2 years (not long after the president commissioner left) and they expect a 2 year shortage of key machinery.

Dow Jones Newswire"Nvidia is seeking shareholder approval to double the number of authorized shares to 8 billion--a year after doubling the number of authorized shares to 4 billion and effecting a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a dividend. The latest proposal would again require support from a majority of the shares outstanding. Abstentions and broker non-votes would be the same as a vote against, the company says. Nvidia's board backs the proposed amendment, saying the additional shares would give the company discretion to take certain actions, without further shareholder approval, for such things as stock splits, equity incentives and more. The company's annual shareholder meeting is slated for June 2."

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 00:08:05'] Issuing more shares is the opposite of doing a share buy back. In the same way that a buyback is normally good for shareholders (provided they actually have the free cash), issuing more shares dilutes your holding and is normally a bad thing for shareholders. A stock split is a totally different thing. It cuts the shares up into smaller pieces but the value of your holding remains the same. The purpose of it is just to lower the cost of each individual share so people can buy smaller amounts at a time, play around with options etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-08 19:54:57'] I was searching for that NVDA 8 billion shares thing and literally found no information except the same copy and paste headline.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that dont know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-18 20:25:30'] Nvidia will always be overvalued, when they stop being overvalued then it's time to sell.They are an industry leader in graphics cards,  have a new market in data centers, and an emerging AI sector. Have you looked at their stock price over the last 10 years? Have you seen they beat estimates every quarter for the last 5 years?  Their CEO is a visionary and strong leader.Either you believe in the company or you don't. You won't be getting Nvidia at a undervalued price so just put that notion out of your head.

POST_TEXT: b"Well my NVDA had grown 108% to 6.5% of my portfolio and I woke up debating whether I should trim a little.  \n\nNVDA has been on a great run and I bet in another few months it'll be getting closer to $300, but I felt like I was getting a little greedy and 6.4% was a little much although I love Nvidia and believe its a long term winner.\n\nSo I feel a little bad and a little better now that it's around 5.1% portfolio.  Probably didnt make much of a difference in the long run either way, but to me approaching 7% portfolio seemed a little risky.\n\nThe gains were long so little tax.  I guess we have to take profits once in a while right?\n\nAnyways I feel the market is so stretched right now so I don't feel bad adding to my cash for if we have a correction!\n\nJust wanted to say Nvidia is one of my favorite investments and companies besides MSFT AAPL and stuff.\n\nI'm still officially up 101%.  Should I trim to 4.5% or just leave it be now?\n\nThanks.  Long NVDA!!"

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 09:55:37'] Nividia is 70% my portfolio. Maybe Im doing it wrong. Oh well I believe in Nividia being here in 10 years. My solution is to add more money to diversify, not take away potentially my biggest earner.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:22:26'] I bought NVDA at $60 pre split and at $120 pre split I considered selling since it had doubled but I decided not to. I'm still holding and it grew to be more than a third of my portfolio. I'm not selling. Dont sell winners.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 09:59:23'] If I were you I would leave it cause I wouldn‚Äôt want any tax despite long term gains and see no real reason to sell.That said, selling it to put it into something more diverse would certainly be prudent.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 12:02:13'] One of my worst financial decisions was selling nvda as an 8 bagger. If I still held it, it would be a 40 bagger.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 14:35:24'] I have owned Nvidia stock for 6 years. Every time I consider selling, I think about the reason I bought in the first place and if that reason has changed. I bought because they made the best chips in the business, and had plenty of room to grow - they still do and I think it still does!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:16:06'] I have college educationS worth of NVDA in my portfolio. If you believe in the value of what they bring to market long term, why are you letting a percentage number detract from that?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 13:50:24'] Let your winners run.  This adage applies to NVDA.  IMO.  Lots of upside ahead.  I only trim winners when I‚Äôm unsure how long tailwinds will last.  NVDA might face some more hurdles on ARM acquisition but chip demand and being one of main building blocks of the Metaverse tailwinds will keep lifting it for a long long time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:58:44'] I am selling some nvda today as well, it is good to take some profit sometime.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 12:58:50'] Nothing wrong with that. I sold half of my NVidia when I reached 125% and same with AMD to recoup initial investment and let the other half run.  They were becoming a bit too heavy in my portfolio (55K each initial investment).  Profit is profit.  Will be doing the same when my TSMC reaches 125% (I'm at around 90% now).

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 03:20:27'] I don't know how large your portfolio is and how close you are to retirement, but if NVDA is one of your highest conviction stocks 6.5% is a very small allocation.Remember diversification doesn't build wealth, it conserves it. For individual investors 99% of the risk is in your lack of knowledge, only 1% is in the actual company you own. It's less risky to own 1 company you know everything about than 10 you know only the basics of.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 14:24:01'] Where are you investing the profits?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 14:39:56'] Nothing wrong with 5.1% of a portfolio in a single stock. Over 10% you should probably trim.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 15:26:42'] No perfect answer. I trim when a stock gets over 10% ever since I let AOL run to 40% around 2000 and lost a lot back. It was a mistake to trim AAPL though, if I never sold a share it would be close to a million. In general, if a stock isn‚Äôt as volatile you can hold more without worrying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 16:31:45'] Taking profits is part of the game. Only sell if you have somewhere better to park the money. But also why cut your winners if you think your winners are going to keep winning?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 16:36:26'] NVDA is that one stock that I kick myself for not buying. I put it on my watch list Mar 2019 when it was $10 a share but I switched brokerage firms and didnt buy it. Now its over 2000% increase from then. Turning my 10k into 200k would have been nice.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 19:43:52'] Sounds like you've justified your decision, but in my opinion you should always let your winners run. Don't sell until your confidence in the company changes, you need the money for something else, or a better opportunity presents itself.I bought in 2015 and am up over 48x on my initial NVDA investment and wouldn't have close to my returns had I sold at 2x, 3x, or 10x. I've never trimmed a single share (in fact I reinvest dividends) and NVDA now represents the vast majority of my net worth.  I sleep well at night, even if it tanks I'll still end up ahead of where I'd be if I never bought it in the first place.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 01:16:22'] I just put in an order today to take some profits from Nvidia myself, part of that is because I need the money to help pay for a car I am looking at getting. Either way, it's not always a bad thing to take some profits away. Yes, you could miss out on some money, but yes it could also tank tomorrow for whatever reason. Sometimes we gotta take some of the profits out for whatever reason. I like to look at occasionally taking profits as a hedge on my investments.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 02:58:41'] It's about 81% of my self-managed fuck around portfolio (admittedly, it isn't very robust). Nvidia is my favorite, not just because of its performance but because it was basically my first stock that I really got motivated about. I read a lot and did my DD and it just "felt right". The feeling is still right and I believe in the company. I don't anticipate selling anything any time soon.

POST_TEXT: b"I often hear a lot about how this & that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.\n\nThere's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side. \n\nFor example:\n\nUber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.\n\nTSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.\n\nNVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand "
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:32:41'] "datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge & after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze."This is basically the same as the infamous (and wildly wrong) quote"No one will need more than 637 kb of memory for a personal computer" - Bill GatesHistorically speaking, while there are short-term fluctuations in the demand for powerful chips, long-term demand always goes up
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:41:02'] Your point about NVDA doesn‚Äôt make sense. More powerful GPUs are unlocking more powerful AI applications. I foresee this trend continuing, which means data centers will need more GPUs over time because their old GPUs won‚Äôt be able to handle the latest models. Personally, I think NVDA is over valued, but not for the reason you listed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:20:53'] It was argued by many that some tech companies like AAPL now deserve "staple multiples", which are even higher than tech multiples. The problem really is one where there is so much money floating around that investors will say whatever to rationalize the present outrageous valuations across the board.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:49:54'] By this metric basically this only really leaves software/data companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:31:12'] This isn't a tech vs. non tech issue, but more of one where people see "growth(!!!!)" and then don't think about what it might grow into. Tesla is a great example of that in that it there are companies that one can see as 85th percentile outcome (Mercedes) and 99.5th percentile outcomes (Toyota) and then 99.9999 percentile outcomes (somehow much bigger than Toyota) and find that all the valuations of these excellent outcomes are already more than priced in. Its one thing when there is something totally new--like, who knows with this internets thingy how big petsdotcom could get--but shouldn't be ignored when you are dealing with more or less known industries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:23:40'] Ok... You gave some examples of tech companies which don't deserve their valuations. Which tech companies *do* deserve their valuations?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:16:10'] Totally agree on Uber, even more goes for Doordash and the like. At least Uber started out undercharging rides to undercut the market, there was a real benefit to the service they offered vs historic methods.(Sidebar: anyone remember Uber and Lyft leaning hard into driverless cabs? Imagine that was a fruitless money sink, Tesla has more chance of creating that service, given that is a pipe-dream now, any justification for tech sector prices left with it)Food delivery services on the other hand have inserted themselves into a system and take significant margin from take-out services, under pay their staff and triple charge customers (increased menu prices vs. phoning an order in, platform service charge and increasing tip need to even get it delivered).  Beyond a joke they can‚Äôt make money despite screwing every party of the transaction over.What room do they have to grow to make profitability? The service is already falling apart.Couldn‚Äôt even make money during the pandemic‚Ä¶ smh. That‚Äôs a sector crying out for AI, just put delivery costs out to bid based on live demand vs supply (let the drivers pick the pay rate they‚Äôll take) run a delivery support service only, integrate with existing delivery services (Uber etc) /rant over, fuck doordash

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:13:40'] Translation: I missed the move and justify my lack of participation due to ‚Äúvaluation‚Äù concerns.Same thing Cathie Wood said when she dumped NVDA and missed out on billions.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to end well‚Äù is another thing we tell ourselves to make us feel better about missing moves.The valuation of a company is the price of its stock. Last I checked you can‚Äôt get paid for a low PE ratio.Nvidia is insanely overvalued based on standard analysis but it can remain this way for a long time. When institutions fall in love with a stock it‚Äôs not a trend you want to fight.This is the undisputed leader in the hottest industry that is hungrier and hungrier for GPUs and software to leverage them. Investing is not about being right, it‚Äôs about buying stocks that go up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:59:13'] None of these posts really have an intimate understanding of why GPUs are crucial to ML nor how ML works.Our economy has been turbo-blasted by deep learning since roughly 2000. The reason why wasn't some fundamental breakthrough in computer science, it was because we finally had enough compute to make these large scale networks learn and interpolate without it taking forever. Deep learning impacted the economy because HARDWARE got better. We've had the "recipe" for deep learning since like the 50s.Similarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been "around" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called "attention" and "transformers" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s. So again, the reason for this compute is HARDWARE related.If data is the new oil, then GPUs (or better yet TPUs or other ML focused architectures) are the pump jack.

Like nvdia with the around 200 PE ratio. Come on, anyone who buys a stock at that PE is just asking for trouble. I know I will be downvoted for this but it is plain stupidity to buy any stock over 40-50 PE. Look back at IBM how many poeple bought into it in its height. Or any dotcom stock back then. Sell at this high price while you can, it won't be like this forever. And yes give me downvotes, if I can help at least one person with this post not to lose more than 50% of their portfolio because of a crazy overvalued stock I would take it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 02:37:01'] Stop relying on analyst projections and price. Look at the fundamentals.The company has an EV/EBIT ratio of 94. 2019 it was at around 20-30 and 2014 at around 10. Growth has accelerated, but not in the same vein as the multiple, which 3x in less than 3 years. .Is Nvidia a great company and here to stay. Yes, but it is also hella expensive. Things can even get more expensive, but the multiple might contract. What happens when we hit a bear market and the multiple goes back to 30 EV/EBIT? If you DCA, then that might be a decent strategy, but even if you cut the current stock price in half there is no proper margin of safety.

If they do it and someone is stupid enough to buy it, they will be sitting in a sauna playing games.On top of that, Nvidia threatens OEMs to build computers and laptops for Intel's (invested in Intel) new Alchemist GPU with cheap components otherwise Nvidia will cut and delay supply to them of their own products.And then as a cherry on top, they cut supply of GPU (while still making it) in order to keep its price high before they release newer GPUs with even higher price, all so the price increase doesn't look too steep.&#x200B;I honestly hope this company goes bankrupt in a few years after people wake up from the hype and AMD and Intel beat the crap out of Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 05:55:35'] RoPrime12 says it the best. Its basically a bubble stock. Look at Intel and Cisco in the early 2000s its the literally the same story. Its a great company with great growth ahead but there is such a thing as overpaying for growth. Intel is currently the most profitable chip maker in the industry. They make over 77 billion dollars in revenue and Nvidia makes over 16 billion dollars in revenue yet they are currently priced to be 3 times bigger then Intel is right now. Its a big hype and speculation stock. Nvidia is here to stay and they are probably going to keep increasing revenue and earnings but that doesn‚Äôt mean their stock price id going to move.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:02:34'] GOOG is up about 6% since earnings and announcing the split which is pretty solid. If you bought the day after earnings then you were late to the game and buying the news. That said it'll be gaining plenty leading up to July assuming the market generally trends upwards and I'd expect more movement post split then pre
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 16:55:36'] Google is already up 6% and it was less than a week ago we found out about the split.I would expect Google share price to continue to appreciate faster than the overall market going in to the split.The split will mean Google can join the DJIA which is a nice tailwind.But just overall Google is just killing and you want to own.I thought Apple had a great quarter. Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!out of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.Google still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.Take Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.But Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.People forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.Google is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.But the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.Google had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.BTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.I am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.People think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:03:56'] There will be a run up Google but much closer to July when the split happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:29:36'] Google has NEVER traded the way that Tesla has and thinking that it will is a mistake. It can move in a big way, but a big move for it is more like jumping 30% over a time period of a few months, and Tesla has pulled 50%+ in a month.If the worst of it is over for the Nasdaq, this can trade $3300-3500 by July. I'd be really surprised if it was more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:37:59'] Plenty of time before July. People are waiting to see what happens after rate hikes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:39:06'] I think the wait for the google split has a lot to do with it. AAPL and NVDA both split within 4-5 weeks of the announcement, GOOG on the other hand won‚Äôt split for another 5 months. It‚Äôs pre split run up should start mid June, possibly sooner. I feel your pain though, grabbed some shares as well after the announcement and am down. It‚Äôll recover though and a great long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:15:13'] We're those splits occurring when the market trend was bullish? Because the trend right now is bearish, with signs of it possibly going either way. People might be hesitant. All those other stocks also weren't 3k prior to split?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 18:04:33'] My guess is AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA announced their splits during a raging bull market, and GOOGL announced it during a downtrend.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:50:40'] GOOG/GOOGL is an almost 2T market cap stock. You arent going to get 50% or more run up to a split. Too big of a market cap for that kind of move.Also it is two stocks while stuff like TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, CRM were just one stock to focus on and pump.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 18:23:43'] First, Google already went up earning, and it holds up better than the market currently. It's a giant company so you need BIG big money to move the stock.Second, we are in a different market environment. Sentiment changes and right now the market worries about a lot of things. If Google has done this last year, maybe you would've a similar run like others that have done splits. The market doesn't have a big appetize for speculative plays right now. It values stocks where they're deserved, and punish those severely that don't put up good results.You made a risky gamble and assumed everything should follow precedents when we are in a different mood. This is what happen after a market euphoria. Retail traders thought they were making easy money and thinking this could go on forever. A lot of people got destroyed speculating on garbage small caps suggested in this sub. Unfortunately, you may have to go through one too, to learn that timing the market, especially using risky strategy like buying OTM option, will cost you dearly when you're wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:50:03'] $AAPL & $GOOGL are great to hold , $TSLA is a bet on Elon Musk, $NVDA is a dominant chip company and a much better value thankfully but it‚Äôs unknown to me if they are investing enough , $CRM is a stock I like but it‚Äôs a question if they can maintain or grow market share
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 02:39:30'] I don't get it why people are afraid that in a recession a monopoly like Google will be affected more than it's market. Guys, when things go bad you cant afford looking for scraps to spend the (cut) marketing budget, you go for what you know it works. Google will bounce up when the market calms down in volatility, probably after the first rate hike. I can tell you when th going gets tough the marketing spend is the first to take a hit, no more events, sponsorship and so on. You have to stick to the basics and google is as basic as you can go.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:24:14'] I dont understand what all of you are thinking.A split changes literally nothing about the company, why would that have any influence on your buying decision?You are buying a company and not a lottery ticket ffs
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:43:03'] A better question would be: why would a stock go parabolic after a split?  The answer to that is either the stock action had nothing to do with the split or people are stupid.  If the action had nothing to do with the split, then your question is answered.  If the answer is people are stupid, then what we can see is stupid people dump more money in the market when everything is going up than when they are getting burned by their other stupid speculative trades (see all the hot tech companies that are down 50+% right now).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 21:16:08'] I would roll out of those calls before THETA takes you to the house of pain.I saw you bought 3600 2023 calls. Depending on what you paid  based on what I saw today for the jan it needs to move 900 bucks to break even. Considering it just touched or came damn close to intraday ATH and we were in a what is will be a volatile time after a record run up...It's not impossible, but I'd roll out of the shares at a reasonable opportunity over the next month
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:05:41'] At a 20:1 split many retail customers can‚Äôt even afford a few shares so will probably wait till closer to the split or the split if it doesn‚Äôt start rising.Also big money can‚Äôt even move the stock too much because of the price. It‚Äôs easier for big money to drop their stake in a more expensive stock temporarily and buy lots of shares of a lower priced one than the other way around.Lastly .. you can never look at what another stock did as a guideline to what a current stock will do.There is too much reverse psychology and misdirection going on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:09:45'] Sell the options, buy the shares. After split sell CCs against your shares. Collect premiums and sleep at night. Not advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 04:31:27'] Whelp general consensus is people are much much hesitant this year and waiting for Fed Ted talks to guide their investments.I would say IV will continue to spike hard last few weeks before split and then spike even harder post split.  That should accommodate OTM calls because let's face it, no one can afford ITM calls right now. I plan to buy one huge Jan 2024 when the next Fed Ted talks go through to see where the sentiment is, then throwdown on it and let it ride.  If it spikes like crazy presplit and post split, I'll probably sell.  If not, theta will guide my way through whatever the hell is gonna happen this year

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 07:38:16'] Im still up more than 1000% on NVDA and I wouldnt be if I didnt just sit out these swings. They are pumping on all fronts. Their forward PE doesnt look as bad. Who cares about the current PE? This quarter will be the infliction point of Drive Orin revenue and H100 revenue. Satya Nadella has been talking about digital twins on the MSFT earnings call and GFN is leading in video game streaming. It could go up from here or down you dont know. Currently the price is just following macro movements. If the market recovers NVDA will reflect that 5x. So what is it worth to call it expensive now?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 21:45:41'] I'd start buying at $80. That would put them at a P/E ratio that better reflects their risks and growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 18:19:54'] it‚Äôs too expensive for me right now.  I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than about $150.  That means i probably won‚Äôt ever get a chance to buy it but maybe QQQ is in a bigger bubble than I think and all the big tech falls a lot more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 21:28:14'] I think there are better investments out there. Poor risk/reward at these levels still. Will it be up in 5 years? Sure. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll outperform even the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 23:41:43'] I just replied to another post about NVDA here in r/stocks so maybe consider that info.   (Not sure if this link will post correctly:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/s0msw0/nvidias_fair_valuation)Obviously, no one can tell you for certain however, I do not have a concern with their current share price.  If it was half as much, I would be buying two times as much stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 20:35:24'] If you believe in crypto and the metaverse you should buy it for a 10 year old ASAP. if you think those things are the next 3D you should not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-11 08:00:10'] I just went through an exercise myself to identify some possible targets.The problem is, it got way over-extended beyond the long-term moving averages and is still overpriced (P/S of 27, forward P/E of 50). So...Target 1: A reversion back to the 12-month moving average, which would bring it down to the $215-$225 area. However, it would still be overpriced at that level so...Target 2: On a valuation perspective, a more reasonable P/S of 15 (which some might say is still too high) would bring it all the way down to around $150. What's notable about this level is that it also corresponds with the lengthy consolidation area from Sept 2020 to March 2021.Given everything that is going on with tapering and interest rates, and the fact that the most reliable price targets are ones that reflect a conjunction of technical and fundamental levels, I wouldn't be surprised to see Target 2 become a reality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 14:32:06'] NVDA will become a good buy at 214 and an even better buy at 204 based on volume profile analysis of the quarterly price assuming the market is still tanking!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 10:13:00'] Looking at some of the buy-in prices in this thread...lmao. No wonder some people keep waiting forever for the price that never comes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 20:33:35'] Below $150 will be a good buy. Don't listen to bagholders here who are saying it will never go to that price. They were saying the same thing when it was $340 that it will never go below $250. Half of them disappeared within a month.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 02:26:45'] Ever heard of margin of safety? There is NONE for nvidia at the moment, so when there is a margin of safety that matches how risky you wanna be, and has a realistic calculation the it‚Äôs the right time to buy
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 11:17:30'] It will fall when I buy in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 04:41:07'] It might sound crazy but I would say bellow 150.Personal opinion:NVDA is hyped with P/E ratio	72.16. Crypto is going down, electricity(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis) is going up so mining is not cost effective as it used to be. On top of that issues in Kazakhstan, China, Russia - do your own research. Gaming will be still here and always was. AI revenue is expected to grow - but it is also effected by the innovation, many companies already have the HW. The revenue & earning were amazing in 2021 - dont take me wrong. Every company has a revenue/market cap a I don't dare to speculate how far is NVDA from it. For me NVDA is definitely pass right now. Too many red flags. Lets see how the price looks in 2 weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 06:25:42'] Feels like an echo chamber in here. Unpopular opinion: intrinsic value is subjective (see Tesla). P/E for tech companies is very high due to being forward looking and semiconductors are one of the most innovative fields. They are not producing wheels and stove tops. They are literally leading society with technological innovation supporting the metaverse, AI, quantum computing, autonomous driving, etc. To not have a multiple above more traditional manufacturers doesn't make much sense.

Now, the freight recession of 2023 has officially arrived."  Click the link if you want to read more about the lower volume of containers of goods being shipped to the US from China.  As for someone that works in transportation; long haul trucking freight fell through the floor beginning in March 2023 and we have yet to see a bottom for demand.   Now US economy is tilted more towards service than goods.  But this is not a good trend for China.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 11:31:58'] Just finished reading the minutes. Generally nothing new in there in my opinion. * Fed believes GDP will decrease in the coming quarters leading to a mild recession with modest increase in unemployment* Fed doesn't expect any rate cuts this year. The earliest rate cut they believe could come at the 1/2024 meeting baring something dramatic happening to the economy that would necessitate rate cuts before then.  * The need for further rate increases is uncertain but less likely than before due to recent banking stress, which they feel has and will continue to lead to tighter lending conditions. * Inflation is easing slower than they expected despite improving supply chains (see quote below). > Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptablyhigh. They commented that data through March indicated that declines in inflation, particularly for measuresof core inflation, had been slower than they had expected. Participants observed that although core goodsinflation had moderated since the middle of last year, ithad decelerated less rapidly than expected in recentmonths, despite reports from several business contactsof supply chain constraints continuing to ease.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 05:43:10'] People are being really dumb about debt ceiling. The US has plenty of tax revenue to cover the debt. The plan behind scenes according to journalists is pay debt first, then SS and medicare. So 'defaulting' will cause a recession since government would have to skip payroll for employees, and payments to businesses. But debt will be paid. You would likely see yields plunge. And whoever does business with government is fucked. This scenario wouldn't likely last long as pressure on Biden would explode to cut a deal.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:57:05'] This is pure speculation, but one bear thesis I might see for NVidia is that at these prices, issuing more equity would be a pretty smart financial move. Especially as the cost of debt goes up making equity issuance more attractive. I think this will spook equity investors though, at least the short-term minded ones. The richer the valuation, the larger the probability of future (stock) underperformance all else held equal. On a side note, slightly curious to see if APPS has another disastrous earnings report. I often forget I hold this stock. I'm anticipating a 10% sell-off *at least*.

Yeah, anyone buying shares in a hot stock should realize that they could lose a large percentage, if not everything they put in. I‚Äôve been there riding it all Da Wae to zero.The way I see it, every once in a while there is at least a chance for a paradigm shift. Before the shift occurs, the hype occurs.

POST_TEXT: b"I know no one can predict this for sure but since 90% of semiconductor-grade neon comes from Ukraine, if Russia goes to war with them how will it impact stocks from companies that rely on it? Primarily AMD and Nvidia, but also companies like Microsoft, Tesla, Apple etc. which also rely on semiconductors for manufacturing, would their stock prices go down? I would imagine, especially since the entire stock market would take a hit, but particularly those that rely on imports from those countries. Of course I'm praying that no war breaks out but it does make me wonder what will happen to these companies that had been thriving up until recently."

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 11:32:22'] I‚Äôve been in the upstream semis precursor industry since 2011 (Gases). In 2014 there was a significant cost increase, but American and Asian manufacturers have and will find a way to get raw material. Neon is generally produced in Russia as a biproduct and then purified in Ukraine. Unless Vlad goes Nuclear there shouldn‚Äôt be a major disruption aside from increased cost across the industry. Neon also exists in the atmosphere, and American companies have found a way to extract a viable quantity of product through specialized processes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 14:04:13'] They will go down because retail is a bunch of scared bitches. Then big money will get great deals to drive the price back up and retail will fomo in for higher than they sold for.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 10:45:11'] Apparently Ukraine is a major supplier of neon gas which is used in chip manufacturing
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 14:44:28'] It's less about neon and more about the market going risk off. NVDA and AMD are both very richly valued because they are great fast growing companies. When the market goes risk off richly valued companies tank while everyone runs to the safety of LMT, PG, etc.There are other sources for neon that don't cost much more than Ukrainian neon and the supply is plentiful. The cost of neon isn't a particularly large percentage of the cost of a delivered chip. Even if neon goes 10x, chip price will only go up a little.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 10:53:18'] Besides market melt down? Most likely, nothing
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 14:28:43'] Well just look at how Covid affected things when supply got screwed. GPUs going for stupid money on eBay and idiots happily paying it. The problem now is the companies have learned people are willing to pay ridiculous prices when demand vastly outstrips supply. Demand may be affected if certain assets take a hit but supply would be severely restricted if the worst happens and there's a neon shortage. Though I'm unsure when that shortage would actually hit. I'd imagine they stock pile it?TLDR: with new products on the horizon I'd expect any restrictions to supply to result in stupid ass prices as they take their slice of the scalping pie. It would be terrible for actual customers but not necessarily for the company's bottom line.However rationality is irrelevant. Everyone will sell everything just because.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 20:56:43'] They need neon, so buy puts
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 22:35:05'] Neon's inert, right? So it's not perishable? That means it can be stockpiled? What's to say any of them are at a shortage for the foreseeable future?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 04:55:57'] Ukrainian contribution is very minor in terms of semiconductor mining.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 09:07:33'] I would be wary.  Quantum computing, driverless cars, VR, AR, Metaverse, cryptocurrency, NFTs, chatbots part one, etc. were all not what they promised.In terms of AI, machine learning is the most practical branch of it, and everyone has been using it for years, with most tech becoming more black box and cloud service based.  Companies using ML is like saying companies use relational databases.I am a software engineer and I will believe it when I see it.  That said, there is great uses.  Reading medical imaging, checking legal agreements, diagnosing patients, and my favourite giving me a single answer to something without going to boilerplate and ad clogged websites.  But the stuff they impress you with is still kind of novelty and they are automating only a small percent of some  jobs.  Just seems like they want to pump share prices with hype.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 07:38:13'] It‚Äôs funny reading these comments when most think AI is just Generative AI. There is a lot more to this field that has been in play for many years already. ChatGPT is amazing, but it is just an evolution to a large foundation that has been building for a while. You all are definitely looking at a tip of an iceberg. MSFT, AMZN, Google, IBM, Meta, etc have been heavy into AI for a long time and been acquiring companies around it for years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 21:44:37'] Unfortunately, it isn't an easy question to answer.Your best bet will probably be to keep an eye on AI news and updates online, and focus on those that are the first in their new medium.For example, there are already quite a few well-known AI image generators, but there aren't really any solid AI animation generators.

Basic computers run off transistors and the AI is created from these components, quantum computers run off of atoms which is insane and the race to make the first one is underway between China and America. IBM, Google, Microsoft are all in it, do you understand what kind of AI can be developed from quantum computing?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 08:59:26'] There are three levels to the semiconductor tree. Branches, trunk, roots:1. Branches: AI implementation (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta). They are big and already successful, they‚Äôll by and/or use the winners. I tend to stay away from these myself because I think they get enough attention already. 2. Trunk: AI chip makers (TSMC, NVIDIA, AMD, Samsung, Intel). They compete with each other, though TMCS and NVIDIA have a hell of a lead, NVIDIA‚Äôs is not so stable as it‚Äôs made out to be. Also their corporate consumers don‚Äôt like them and are always looking for alternatives. 3. Roots: Semiconductor process manufacturers (ASML, TSMC). TSMC is nice because it forms a very stable base to the tree. But the geopolitical currents it faces between China and the US cannot be overstated, think Black Swan risk. Companies at the roots are the focus of US sanctions against China, which puts difficult to predict headwinds. Someone else here used the ‚Äúgold digger, shovel seller, shovel maker‚Äù analogy. Well, there will always be differs, there will always be shovel sellers. But the shovel makers are of geopolitical importance and thus simultaneously have guaranteed growth with the market segment, but also risks that are fundamentally impossible to account for.

For example Ai need lots of aggregated or specific data for training AI that can solve specific problems. Here where you should do research on companies that only focus on providing training data services.

Intel liked them so much, they scooped them up for a cool $15.3 billion.Then there's Palantir, the data analytics software provider for government agencies and corporations. They helped track down Osama bin Laden, so you know they're not messing around. And let's not forget about NVIDIA, the OG of GPUs. Their graphics processing units are the real deal when it comes to AI applications. They're even powering some of the world's fastest supercomputers.Not an investment advice. DYOR :)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:34:40'] One thing I learned the past year isIf you short into the hype, you're smoking the pipe.ChatGPT came out and you shouldn't even *think* about shorting anything related - let alone the company that makes the chips for AI. Now I think Nvidia is probably overvalued. But it could stay high for a very long time. If it's earnings keep doing well and AI keeps making headlines who know when that PE will finally drag the price back to earth.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 21:14:06'] You're also not factoring in the commodities market. They're able to harvest tears of all the salty redditors that didn't buy in under 200 and undercut the world's salt mines. That's like 1/3 of the value ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:13:56'] Hype and fomo does not have logics. So for short term it seems strong but eventually it will fall back some
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:01:43'] This AI hype is reminding me of the BTC run from 2021 .. conversations about use case and monetization, aims for improved productivity and efficiency, extreme and difficult to explain data, rotation into a commodity deemed ‚Äúsafer growth‚Äù than other assets .. The VIX is relatively low right now given all the external market pressures that have been navigated over the past few months (rate hikes, bank failures, and now debt ceiling), so perhaps the price will stabilize and create a new support line well above 300. We should all acknowledge that this market is not making any logical sense .. just like BTC‚Äôs rise didn‚Äôt. NVDA has a lot more tangibles going for it, but I can‚Äôt help but notice these patterns and warn that this feels a hell of a lot like a bubble that we can convince ourselves of either way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 04:13:39'] >These seem like great conveniences for the modern world. Transformative recession resistant groundbreaking technology? Not so much.I'm not an NVDA bull by any stretch of the imagination, but I think naming a few use cases like this and then saying it's not going to be a life-changing technology is a bit naive.It's sort of like people in the 90s when the internet was becoming a thing being like "what are the actual use cases? chatrooms, finding information faster, organising events, maybe buying things online etc". Now we look back on that and think it was silly  - the internet affects almost every part of our daily lives. And I don't know why you think it needs to be recession-resistant - NVDA is priced based on its long term potential (even if I do think it's overvalued), and recessions tend to last less than a year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:44:54'] NVIDIA may be overpriced as far as graphics cards go, but they also have an 85% market share in gaming graphics cards I believe. And with new advancements such as DLSS it's hard to argue that AMD has "bridged the gap". Ray Tracing and DLSS are the big new advancements in Gaming and Nvidia is the one pushing those, not AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:18:07'] There‚Äôs nothing like Nvidia cards for gaming out there. I hope AMD indeed catches up cause they enjoy a pricing advantage because of the lack of competition. That is my bet actually, that AMD gets their show together for GPUs

The one thing (apart from the ridiculous valuation atm) that gives me pause in adding to my positions and increasing my AI exposure is the \*considerable\* geopolitical risk that these companies have with Taiwan and China's fraught relationship. Buffet selling his $4.1B stake in TSMC was a red flag for me, as TSMC builds basically all chips for NVDA and AMD.If China takes action against Taiwan, are these companies nimble enough to uproot fabrication and setup elsewhere?That is a massive global disruption risk in my eyes and I'd love to see or hear any takes here from anyone who has explored this more deeply than I have.

Automotive is continuing to thrive.  I am still having record sales monthly.  I see automotive semiconductors an attractive place to be in the future especially with EVs coming more online, they have more chip content then ICE vehicles.  Just my opinion.   The companies that I own are MCHP, NXPI, MPWR and ADI also ON is starting to look attractive, AVGO has a nice dividend. TSMC does build some of the products above but a lot of them have their own fabs which is a real advantage in bringing new chips to market.   I may be bias but this is what I see.

While Intel is easily the worst out of the 3, I believe they have way more upside from it's current position if they're able to turn things around, which I think is a higher chance than not. That being said, AMD likely has plenty of upside to go too. They've only just announced a partnership with Microsoft for investing in AI. Obviously they'll make a breakthrough sooner or later and have a nice pop. Plus it'll ride along with other AI stocks meanwhile. AMD is probably the safest choice here.Nvidia can go either way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:35:25'] Investing in stocks requires careful consideration of various factors, including an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, investment goals, and thorough research.    In the event of a market decline, investors often look for opportunities to buy stocks that they believe are undervalued or have strong long-term potential. However, the choice of a specific stock to buy during a market drop would depend on individual investment strategies and preferences.    It's important to conduct thorough research, analyze the fundamentals of a company, consider its industry outlook, and assess other relevant factors before making any investment decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances is highly recommended.    Remember, investing in stocks involves risks, and it's important to make informed decisions based on your own analysis and understanding of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 14:56:52'] I am sharply revising FY2027 guidance upward for my portfolio, with a projected subreddit-adjusted pro-forma EBITDA decade-over-decade growth of 539%. Thanks to investments into AI, I'm increasing my estimate of the TAM of my skillsets to $300M by 2028 (according to a research note from AP Morgan Chase). With the completion of my extensive R&D by 2025 (in dreadfully abstract statistical theory that we redefine as AI), along with synergies from ESG institutional flows (due to our coal investments pledging to be net 0 by 2075), the future hasn't been brighter (and warmer). Already our business has secured letter of intents and a massive implied backlog in the form of 'Bro join my quant start-up, I need a CTO to run advanced linear regression models on stock charts'. I am pleased to announce the initiation of shareholder returns, with a dividend in the form of 8 updoots per quarter for shareholders on record prior to January 8th, 2014. (We went public last year)Stay tuned for our conference call once I figure out what an operator is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 14:55:49'] Around end of March there was a long consolidation around 4050 and 4150.  That flatness would imply market's view is neutral of the future since roughly equal buyers and sellers.  However, because of buybacks and constant inflows in a healthy economy, flat is technically bearish since stocks should generally have a small positive drift as a default.  Now that we've finally broken out of that channel we should be bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 18:38:49'] considering i can sell a used 3080 for double what i paid for it over a year ago means NVDA is likely having some severe supply chain issues....which is usually the kiss of death in an earnings call(even mighty Apple has been chopped down a couple pegs due to it), but the metaverse is hype right now and they are one of the core "meta" companies as well as the center of car autonomy.  If they are allowed to acquire ARM its just a matter of time before they become a 1Trillion company, heck even if they dont....so anyway, i plan on selling a bit into earnings in case of bad results at which time i'll buy back over the next few days once the lows settle out...likewise if it pops i'll drop some more shares over the next few days of run ups to buy back after people forget and freak out over inflation/rising rates again.  rinse repeat retire....

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-19 00:55:30'] Both. Think there's support at roughly both levels. Will have to see how the wider market goes, but I'd nibble at 250 and bite harder at 200.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 10:13:48'] AI isn't a hype cycle, but I'd say consumer AI is maybe a hype cycle. B2B and backend AI has been going on for 5+ years. ChatGPT and some of these other apps/tools brought it to consumers, but businesses have been fine tuning and using it for awhile. Only now are the models being available. I'm more interesting in finding the B2B companies that are using it for mega cost savings. &#x200B;Can PWC or E&Y use it to reduce their auditors count by half? Can city inspectors/architects use it to reduce workload for non-compliant blueprints. The companies selling shovels are already known, but I haven't seen the list of up and coming mid-caps with huge potential now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 11:01:47'] I really think the winners will be the companies that help people make sense of that data.  That should be PLTR, but I don't feel comfortable there.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 10:09:35'] In my opinion, the companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare , possibly UNH or defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty program (they know a lot about you and your preference).  I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data and how companies interrelate as I expect they are already using it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 12:51:56'] Another undervalued sector that will greatly benefit from AI is genomics. Think EXAS, CRSP, DNA, TDOC. Massive data sets + AI to sift through these data sets = profit? probably maybe.

ChatGPT is interesting but I actually think that Stable Diffusion is what is going to drive hardware demand.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:07:53'] Never. The only time I think they would make sense is if you don‚Äôt really want to hold the stock, you just want to gamble on it. If that‚Äôs the case I don‚Äôt the buy the stock. TA traders would probably use it playing breakouts and etc but again they don‚Äôt have any long term belief what they‚Äôre buying.Personally I like buying and selling knives so when I get ahold of something on the cheap I expect it to continue falling for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 18:24:52'] No but, sometimes yes. I would with NVDA. Understand that large moves happen after hrs & unless you are watching it every hr it could be rough. Take the profits imho. I don‚Äôt know what more you could hope for / squeeze out of this NVDA shenanigans. Good luck OP!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:40:29'] I do not like stop loss.  I use limit on all acquisitions and it is not well protected.  My stop loss is however, lower than the market. I am with you the debt ceiling, inflation, 1.3% gdp growth will limit what the economy can handle. There can be glitches for rest of this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 20:40:13'] no

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 21:06:48'] Stop loss is not 100% especially if stock tanks at the open. The only for sure ‚Äústop loss‚Äù is if you buy a put.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:21:54'] I define my exit before I buy. If I‚Äôm trading the stock I use a 25% trailing stop. I don‚Äôt take big losses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 18:09:25'] No one knows the answer. Go with your gut feeling. If you have a feeling it's at it's peak, I would set a small trailing stop order.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 20:11:32'] Yes but I swing trade. Buy stop above my trigger. Stop below the dollar figure of the current pivot or support level depending on how wide the stock is trading. Trail by either prior lod or the 8day Sma. Sell enough to cover the risk on the first move and let the rest ride. Have a game plan of risk/reward of 3-5:1 and a defined out if she don‚Äôt break out. Stops me from losing stacks. Let‚Äôs me deploy large positions without emotion since I‚Äôm already aware of and prepared to lose x dollars if it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work out. Means I don‚Äôt bag hold. Means I don‚Äôt get greedy in profit taking. Means I technically only need to be right 1/5 times to make money. Lots of benefits. Also I‚Äôm just out here buying technical set ups so your flags/wedges/etc usually in the 3rd run up into resistance. Stocks over $25 only and with all time charts up and to the right unless it‚Äôs an ipo. Miss me with just about anything else.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 21:02:21'] I set alerts at where my stop loss would be. If it activates I look at the chart/volume/order book. Occasionally it‚Äôll just be someone hunting for stops during a period of low volume and the stock immediately recovers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 03:14:43'] Nope. As long as my company's fundamentals remain intact, if anything I'll use a buy limit to add more.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:18:36'] I make a note of stop loss levels in my spreadsheet and manually execute them.  If you put in any kind of order that isn't immediately executed, the market makers will see it in advance and f*ck you.  Never show your hand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:10:54'] No, always say I will but never do
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:21:12'] I place buy orders about 10% below the lowest significant volume bar on the fixed range volume profile. It give me a fairly certain fill but sometimes only a partial fill. So, I think most traders use a 10% stop loss.I don't know if market makers can see stop losses but I know where the stop losses are, so the market makers know, too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 02:12:11'] No, not anymore. I thought I was clever and had literally put the first stop loss of my life on some of my stocks ~ 15 years ago when one of those as of yet unexplained pesky ‚Äúflash crashes‚Äù happened and triggered the sale. Entire fucking market plummeted ~1000 points and then recovered all within a couple minutes, but it was done by then. Someone got my shares on a massive discount. The game is rigged
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:18:11'] I use them.   On a non scientific basis, it seems I stop out and the stocks go back above the price I sold more than it saves me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 05:00:17'] If I have time to watch my position and the market going slow with a clear direction, then no, but if Volatility is high or I'm going somewhere I'll set a trailing stop limit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:52:30'] Sometimes, but I try not to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:01:46'] Never when buying falling knives. If it's a bargain I buy little by little until it dips.    When buying soaring stocks setting trailing stop loss makes sense (i.e. 90% of current price), not only as protection but also for taking profit, cuz you want to sell as close to local peak as possible. Might be risky if given stock is too volatile. Finding the sweet spot is tricky, cuz I don't want to sell prematurely, but also don't want to wait too long after the peak and miss the opportunity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:40:04'] I did this week with NVDA. It‚Äôs my first time doing it. Securing 100% profit if it falls back below 390.

I‚Äôll get back in if it falls to more reasonable valuations.But otherwise I‚Äôm mostly in ETFs, so no, I don‚Äôt typically.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 23:49:54'] I've started using trailing stop losses on profitable positions. I used to set a XX% gain and out before, but noticed that I've been leaving money on the table.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:31:47'] I think I have used a stop once in my trading life.  I usually hold things for long term though, so I am not bothered by the ups and down when I am looking a couple years down the road.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-11 11:29:33'] Coming from a scientific and high computing background, I would vote nvdia as a very big buy. High performance cloud computing is still a very very early market with almost no players among the big cloud guys. Nvida is positions the self as a cloud gpu provider for almost all resource intensive tasks including things from months of machine learning jobs to that of pharmaceutical simulation. With their current interest in quantum computing simulators as well, I think they are really positioned for long term (5+ years) market.

I'm up 40% and decent divyEdit: didn't think this would get as much attention as it did. Sorry for no due diligence or more of a write up. I'm not really one for technical data or beating the market etc. My individual stock holdings is so small that it doesn't really matter to me as it's the place I can have some fun with stock picking. I like the company. Please do your own research and this isn't advice.Edit edit: no I don't want your free newsletter
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 06:39:58'] NVDA. I paid 20 a share in 2015. Pre split price. And it still hasn't grown into the market that I bought it for. Self driving cars is the only reason I bought it. Should have bought more shares at the time lol. I didn't anticipate 3000% returns in eight years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 17:52:09'] MA. Shoutout V too. No credit risk, high profit margins, not capital intensive (hand in hand with high profit margins), high barrier of entry by competitors and a wide moat in a duopoly. Checks every box of what I look for in an investment. It‚Äôs like owning a railroad except on the tech side as a payment railroad. Unlikely to ever sell it unless of a catastrophic change.

I buy the preferred stock, because it pays the same dividents, costs about 10% lews, and voting rights are meaningless in a company where the state holds the controlling stake.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 17:09:15'] Amazon, i like how many different potential avenues for growth they have.- cloud- e commerce - advertising - kuiper- just walk and go tech- AI - automation- health. - entertainment Currently 3 of those are growing nicely (cloud, e-commerce, ad) with entertainment also growing and feeding back into the ad/ e-commerce business. The other fields are trillion dollar industries each (except satellite internet I believe) and amazon has a good shot of nailing a few of those and that‚Äôs all they would need. As an investor amazon has the potential to print so much free cash flow by end of this decade alone that it‚Äôs worth jumping in now, it‚Äôs a risk but better odds then most risks imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 00:21:53'] Weird as this may sound I tend to bounce back to Ford on a fairly regular basis. Share price is low enough that I can actually get 100 shares easily and then sell a covered call on that. If you are willing to sell a long dated contract you can do fairly well on the premium collected. Just as an example Jan 2024 $15 strike price for .87 per share. Price currently 12.74 and dividend is .15 per quarter. So 3 dividends for .45 plus the  .87 premium is over a 10% gain right there. Tack on if the call is actually exercised and you are look at another 2.26 per share all in less than a year. That isnt something to sneeze at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 18:20:40'] Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.The company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: "It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%." [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]It's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.I own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.A similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 16:07:21'] American Sports and Outdoors ASO - because I dumped a pile of cash on it last May 2022 and have some ~150% gains already. And this thing even spits out dividends. The market panic of an expected recession by the end of 2022 and it's main competitor Dicks Sporting Goods DKS lowering guidance crushed the stock bringing its forward PE down to 3X and PS to .25 or something. I mean, the valuation was totally crushed at that time bringing the market cap to just ~1B or something and even if expected sales and profit was going to be low, you could still give it a forward guidance of 4x or 5x as historical PE in the sector is between 9 &14. I was pumped to buy it with a margin of safety and just hold it forever and buy every dip and waiting for the recovery. The way the stock acted since then is like "what recession?".Edit: Academy not American

POST_TEXT: b'Hey guys,\n\nJust wanted to share some food for thought about a great company. \n\nThe current PE ratio of NVDA is above 100. Its median (as well as the mean) PE ratio over the past 10 years has been around 31 so it would be nothing but reasonable to think that it will eventually reverts to the mean over the next years.\nFor that to happen, either the share price takes a hit of 70% or the EPS grow to 10 and more.\nAssuming the first one will stay exactly where it currently is and that the company will manage to grow their EPS at around 32% over the next years, it would take 4,5 years for the PE ratio to revert to the mean: in a scenario where NVDA, a 792b market cap company, keeps growing like crazy, someone investing at the current price would get 0% returns for quite a bit of years.\n\nShort-term speculation aside, which may or may not play in favour of those investing at the current price, why would someone choose NVDA over other opportunities right now?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 07:22:49'] nvda and amd are the best bet on semi for now and future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 11:02:29'] PE ratios are not the best measure for high growth and high tech stocks. Many of these mega tech companies can go from PE ratios of 100 to 1 within one quarter if they stop investing completely in R&D and Marketing. Zero expenses in anything but COGS, and boom, you have an instantly super profitable company.So take a look at their balance sheet as listed on their Q3 results: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2022Earnings for Q3 were 0.99/share, with the year end target of $3.50/share. So yes, PE of 100.But look at where their expenses are. For the training 9 months, revenue of 19.2Bn, COGS of 6.7Bn. So gross margin of 76%. Then they have Operating Expenses of 5.4Bn. Let's break that down and say that NVDA stops completely investing in R&D and marketing, and slashes those costs by 80%. That means their operating expenses would fall to $1.1Bn.That would boost their net income to $11.3Bn for the last 12 months, and give them an EPS of $4.54/share, and set them on track for a CY2021 EPS of $6.05. Now their PE ratio is 50. But that would be a one time thing, and without that R&D investment you can assume that NVDA won't remain competitive in their high tech field.Let's ask this another way. In September 2020, when MSFT was $225/share at mkt cap of 1.5T, would you have said "that's overvalued"? The secret to these mega tech companies that are executing well is that the create new markets and dominate them. How do you value a brand new market that doesn't exist yet? For NVDA, the bet is on AI. AI in research, AI in basic commercial consumer interactions, AI in professional visualization, AI everywhere. And this is the tip of the iceberg for such a huge market.If you have 10 year time horizons, trying to look at current PE ratios to decide to invest in a company that's executing well is too myopic. I would instead try to understand whether you believe in that company to execute and grow new markets and new revenue streams to justify their existence.Also, don't forget that the secondary stock market is all about supply/demand. The performance is only a tertiary factor in actual stock performance. Buying and selling stocks on exchanges has no impact on a company's performance at all.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 03:51:34'] It is a good investment, it is fairly easy to identify good companies to invest in. The problem here is getting it at an acceptable price. Keyword here is acceptable, ideally cheap, but if that's not possible, acceptable will do.The thing with companies that are market leaders, they expand with the market and sometimes even create their own markets. So yes, past studies of financial ratios indeed give you a good idea of what to expect, but when companies create markets out of nothing, sometimes they are able to blow past any prior expectations.It is very difficult to value things which do not currently exist yet, I don't know what is the market for the metaverse for example, nor can I evaluate accurately what is the TAM of Tesla's FSD. I can only guesstimate what the potential of these things are, and the reactions of the investors when certain things have been announced.Just be mindful that financial ratios are more backwards looking than they are forward looking, it is a useful matric to look at but you should understand what these ratios can and cannot tell you. PE ratios cannot tell you when a tech company will release the next big thing, and fundamental change the company's outlook.Someone who followed AMD news/technical reviews closely might have a hint of when Ryzen is coming back in 2017, yet someone who studies the ratios won't ever see it coming.Someone who chooses NVDA over current offerings place a higher value on the company's technological prowess as opposed to their financials, they probably taken financials into consideration and judged that what NVDA is doing is worth the extra premium.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 01:59:00'] Personally, I still think it is a good investment as the demand for their products will continue to rise and if there is anything I have taken from the Tesla, EV, bubble it‚Äôs that sometimes the fundamentals are off the table.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 03:47:24'] Debatable. The current market cap seems unsustainable, feels more like a bubble stock peaking instead of a good long investment. Could probably squeeze out some profit, but there's a significant downside risk for a small potential gain in the next year. If you think it has 100% left to give in the next year, you're fucking crazy. Just my personal opinion.Love the company and the stocks performance history, hate it's current price/evaluation.

POST_TEXT: b'Any ideas on how to play the GTA6 release? Articles state that potential release date is fiscal year 2025, so end of 2024-early 2025. I want to enter a long position because I believe the stock will slowly rise up until the game is dropped + rumors that the game will break revenue records. I was thinking of grabbing 2025 LEAPS, or a bunch of shares and holding them. Should I wait until more news is announced about the game, or does this buy-and-hold plan sound fine? Also, buy stocks or LEAPS for this?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:05:11'] I bought a lot of shares at the end of 2022, hoping it would go up when they release a trailer. So far it already beat my expectations even before they released anything. The announcement of a possible release in 2025 recently, gave the stock quite a boost and i personally think it will only rise with the hype, even if the game should flop in the future. It is GTA, people will buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:12:31'] Look at Nintendo. Think about the success of the Mario movie and Tears of the kingdom and look at how the share price has moved. This should tell you a lot about how these events effect stock price

I haven't played any other game that made me think "wow, these people truly give a shit about the product they make" as much as GTA has. The micro transactions may be a little out of hand from a players perspective but if I'm a shareholder then it's all smiles from me haha.Ik this does nothing to answer your question. I definitely don't see this hurting their share price, but timing may be key here since the game will inevitably be delayed for like a year or some shit

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:09:27'] I have already invested because you never know when there will be new information about the release. Every time it's mentioned, it has the potential to drive the price up and it will be mentioned more and more frequently. One thing is for sure, the price will be substantially higher before release than it is now. If you can sit on your hands for a year or two or three it‚Äôs a very safe bet.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 08:31:36'] I suppose if you didn't think it was worth buying three weeks ago when it was the same price you shouldn't buy now as the company hasn't changed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 10:29:55'] Bought a starting position to keep an eye on it. While the rest of the semiconductor supplier analyst downgrades don‚Äôt bode well ($AMAT, $ASML), I like that $NVDA continues to be upgraded. For now I don‚Äôt see a reason semiconductor space would slow down unless there are supply issues for semiconductor manufacturers which with all the supply chain issues these days it could happen, but either way I think it‚Äôs a good company with a good outlook for the next couple years while the semiconductor shortage continues and crypto/gaming/AI continue their popularity.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-28 20:53:00'] I would hold off on buying long. I don't think the selloff is over.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 20:13:54'] Never sell to buy back in. That is just another way of saying you are trying to time the stock price which is impossible to do. 4.3% is not too high of an allocation for a single stock that you believe in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 19:32:45'] Sell some (if you really want to), and never sell the rest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 20:05:20'] Hold. Timing corrections is easier said than done. I've been waiting too long for a significant correction to enter a position in NVDA and keep waiting for a big correction that hasn't come yet. With a cost basis that low, it makes sense to just hold instead of playing the guessing game. If you sell and buy back at $220 a share, you've just raised your cost basis by $100/share. If you love the stock, maybe buy some more shares at $220 if you want a higher concentration. That will give you a better cost basis over selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 20:09:30'] It‚Äôs an IRA. Just leave it. Over along period with everything needing more technology the company will continue to grow. I‚Äôve yet to meet anyone who successfully times the market correctly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 21:12:58'] I have a similar buy in price, but I put it in my taxable brokerage account for this very reason. I didn‚Äôt want the option of selling early despite the massive run up in the past few months. I wanted to buy and hold for years(or until they missed earnings two quarters in a row). If you‚Äôve done your DD, and believe in the company, don‚Äôt sell until you‚Äôre losing sleep over your position. NVDA currently makes up 11% of my portfolio and has grown into my second largest holding and I won‚Äôt sell a share, only add to it once it corrects 30%. 300 shares @125

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 19:44:28'] 4.3% is negligible.  And $127 cost basis is amazing.  NVDA is probably the single best company that's setup for the 'metaverse'.I personally don't see it dropping any where near the $200 mark (but I'm a random redditor so take that for what it's worth - nothing).Since it's an IRA you've got nothing to lose (since you're way up) if you want to sell a bit... but remember timing is the hardest thing to do when investing - if you want to regain those shares back there's always the chance you'll have to pay up.

A ev/free cash flow yield of sub 1% on a pure play semi stock like nvidia is ridiculous. Even at $200 it would be severely overvalued. Of course the irrational bull market could continue, but I'd be very surprised if three years from now it would still be this price. Remember, as the company matures its growth multiple shrinks. The current levels seem unsustainable to me personally.

With a demand for microprocessors that is not going to let up for the next three years, NVDA seems like an excellent long term buy.

NVDA is in a great place right now. Its retail product GPUs are in high demand, deep moat with AI research, and partnerships with key players like Tesla and Nintendo. The Arm acquisition might fall through, but if it goes through, that‚Äôll be big. I‚Äôve bought in at a DCA of $520, and the rise to $675 has been great.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 22:01:10'] NVDA is my favorite company right now. It dominates the GPU game and is going to grow and dominate the CPU game as well. It is a leader in AI, and will see enormous growth. NVDA chips have crazy demand and they can sell at very high price points and demand remains high.The main thing for me is Jenssen Huang. Dude is a genius and puts great people around him. The leadership team here will continue to make the right decisions, and they put an emphasis on creating value to the shareholders.The price and valuation are very high, but I believe they are justified. The expected earnings growth is phenomenal, and they ALWAYS beat expectations. Don‚Äôt use a lagging PE when talking about valuations, at least use PEG. Do yourself a favor, buy NVDA and hold it for a couple years. It is a volatile stock, so you will have to tough out some gut wrenching dips, but hang in there. This stock rewards shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 22:48:32'] They were a good company 5 years ago when they released the 10 series GPUs which were absolutely incredible for the time, and you could have bought a share for $30. It was overvalued last year. They make $5 billion in free cash flow (and approx the same in income) but their market cap is $400 billion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 20:22:44'] It was overvalued a month ago and it's just insane now. P/E ratio of about 100. Sure you might make money in the short term if the run continues but if things go south NVDA is going to be leading the way into the hole.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 22:52:51'] Jensen is an impressive salesman and they have good tech and a very good moat in CUDA, but I continue to think ARM will be blocked and their CPU announcements are unimpressive.Can it continue? Sure, AI/ML aren't going anywhere and AMD is going to have a heck of a time gaining traction there, plus Mellanox was a good buy.That being said I also don't think they'll enjoy the same kind of GPU hegemony they have in the past with more credible competition from AMD and eventual increased competition from INTC as well. Nor do I think their automotive aspirations will succeed: their platform is too energy hungry.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 23:13:55'] Thank you for all the responses. It‚Äôs overpriced. I‚Äôll wait. Thank you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 22:59:36'] 1st you need to understand that this is a fanatical stock. The sentiment is dominated by gamers and crypto miners and if you are either, you know how they can be total zealots. Thats the biggest warning I can give you. Right now they are high on NVDA but the knife cuts both ways and if the tide turns, price will fall below reason as well.See CD Projekt Red to see what happens when Gamer sentiment turns. They seem to believe that CDR is dead and all future games they make will fail. The price has been shredded despite the best financial year in their history, low PE (albeit cyclical), massive dividend, and re-alignment to make twice as many games going forward... But the sentiment is apocalyptic. They may as well had help make COVID in the Wuhan lab at this point given how people are talking about them. Which is perfect if you are a buyer now but not so much if you were in prior.So back to NVDA, that is what you are facing. Crazy investors. Not bad folks, but just nuts. Can be a good thing if you take advantage of it but can also cut the other way.Fundamentally NVDA in a good place business wise. But its not rainbows and unicorns. For one thing, they are currently heavily influenced by crypto mining. Whether you think thats good or bad is a matter of opinion. Im of the opinion that this is not good for business because if cryto goes away, they may well lose 50% of their rev... the risk is high.The other issue is PC sales really havent gone anywhere in a while and there is a good chance that the move to streaming gaming will eat a huge portion of the gaming market especially consoles, down the road. I would imagine they (Sony, MS, NIN) are all eager to switch to cloud based streaming if they can to eliminate the high cost of consoles and charge monthly fees (and such). So just like how we switched from hard copies to downloads the last 10 years, we may be switching again to streaming in the future. This would be horrible for video cards.Now I am not saying all the above will happen and maybe you dont plan to hold that long anyway. But that would be my bearish argument for a long hold. In the near term, they are obviously overpriced... that is unless you think that they can maintain 50%+ growth for the next 3-4 years or so.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-16 06:01:13'] My biggest gripe about AMD is that they are mostly into low margin markets and they don‚Äôt seem to have anything exclusive to make them a leader. Sure, they might have dethroned Intel momentarily, but Intel can definitely turn around with transitioning to a better node.Ah, time will tell I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-27 20:38:08'] Get me one of those crystal balls from the shelf and you‚Äôll get your answer.  Short term gamblers worry about volatility.  Investors continue to be born and enter the market.  Population growth, expansion of technology and increasing  mass density of investment with limited  quality investment opportunities suggests the moment you invest, in the log run, is less important than making the investment.  For fun, as an educational opportunity, compare compare equity prices of companies at finance.Google.com.  The growth curves (slopes) offer some great visuals and basis for trajectories .  Nothing is guaranteed, however past performance as a prediction of future performance is usually valid.  Yeah, how many people believed that with ENRON & GE?!!!  Buffett places confidence in the stock market,  often pointing out growth of the S&P 500.  Use the finance Google charts to compare ETFs and Stocks to each other and  an index like SPY.  Sure there are short term opportunistic opportunities to buy (buy low/sell high) that might add (beneficially) to total long term profit significantly, still over time you‚Äôll see the price continues to increase as the global economy expands.  NVDA I has stellar innovation and production character.  Chips are key to our present grasp of technology and mega trends.  Incremental investments over time, dollar cost averaging makes sense.  If you believe and trust mankind will continue to rely and innovate with technology and science, efficiencies and expansion are likely also.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 01:47:46'] NVDA is over priced. I would wait for it to drop to 400-500 later on this year with the next correction.A lot of assumptions, but if you look at many big hedgies, they're all cash rich and battoning down the hatches. It's not a good time to get into growth stocks. Outside of china, they are all over valued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 05:06:03'] The strength of offering a competitive savings rate from that start is that your depositors never have incentive to flee, when news comes out saying small banks and financial firms are at risk.You say "let me check to see if SoFI is safe, oh wow I have $2 million insured and a 4.2% interest rate, why move?"Other banks were offering 1% into March 2023. So within a week of SVB everyone with a brain decided to move that money to 4% accounts elsewhere at larger institutions or those that offer more insurance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 09:08:03'] I need to do more research but thats my hypothesis as to why the stock felllike a rock.I went to the earnings transcript and skipped ahead for the Q and A segment. And the overall concern was about keeping up with loan originations and deposit during those challenging Quarters ahead for SoFi.There are fears that rising unemployments will increase defaults on payments and lower revenu growth.The technology segment didn't grew this quarter and Noto said it's because they are transitioning from small businesses to bigger ones.All and all, what I'm getting is fear of the macro environment going forward which is a reasonable argument to make. I looked at other fintech like Lending Club and they are all struggling and decreasing revenue and net income growth. SoFi being the exception here. In this environment an emerging fintech is a high risk high rewards play for sure.

I use the old banks, too, but there's something to be said about customer experience and SOFI nails it while feeling fresh and useful (also like their competitive savings rate). And while I don't think that deserves an insane multiple, I think their current P/S is pretty reasonable for a company that's taking share.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 21:34:51'] I had drinks with a friend yesterday and he was talking about how he was using chatGPT to save time for work. I had dinner with another set of friends today, 2 working ppl in different fields. One's an accountant, and the other in medicine fields. They're using chatGPT to write their business proposals for bank loans. Savings hours of time, maybe 100s of hours. Same for writing reports for patients. Ppl are saving 100s of hours in their jobs, across several fields. This isn't a what if, its happening today.&#x200B;Is it perfect? No, but neither are google search queries and google is a trillion dollar company now. I've never seen a tool become so widespread in such a short time span in my life. This isn't a bubble, its a revolution.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:23:42'] Stock market bubble != technology bubble. The same happened i 2000s dot.com bubble - stock market collapsed but it didnt make the Internet as technology obsolete. Quite the opposite - it thrived and to this day it is the backbone of the global economy and everyday life.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 21:18:20'] Outside of ChatGPT, AI hasn‚Äôt even started at scale yet. Sure, people are buying MSFT and NVDA, but both of those tickers are still below their high from 2021. I pay close attention to the machine learning community and can assure you no one serious is talking about time travel or anything that goes against the laws of physics. When it comes to AI tech and large language models, it‚Äôs the real deal and the development cycles are now measured in days and months. Also, this isn‚Äôt blockchain or the metaverse ‚Äî AI is already powerful enough today, that as of 2 days ago, some scientists and people like Elon Musk are petitioning to slow down the pace of its development (I don‚Äôt agree we should, but shows how smart minds are taking AI very seriously). So, yes there will be an AI stock bubble at some point (probably later this year and next), but imo we haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. That said, because it‚Äôs so early, one caveat is it‚Äôs not yet clear where the value capture for AI will be ‚Äî aside from companies with established competitive advantages (MSFT/OpenAI, NVDA) and maybe some semis (TSMC, ASML, AMD etc), it‚Äôs a bit premature to pile into AI growth stocks (eg, C3.ai)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 22:46:33'] Bought a large portion of MSFT because they do not seem as overly inflated as nvidia and they stand to gain a fuck ton. MSFT is ruthless. Absolutely ruthless. Not only are they taking on Google but they will replace as many jobs as they possibly can to collect service fees. All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization. I can't seem to find any information on whether Microsoft is an investor of OpenAI but I hope they are. That way investing in Microsoft at least means exposure to OpenAI which is currently private.I also think OpenAI's chatGPT is going to become the invisible 5th member of any team. It is the duck. I think Microsoft and OpenAI have proven this is going to be big and it wouldn't surprise me if Microsofts stock doubles because of it. Many jobs are going to utilize this tech.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:28:45'] Personally think it absolutely is a bubble *at this stage*.Companies are jumping on the band wagon how they can leverage AI to do everything and anything and they‚Äôll be a big hype run. It‚Äôll come crashing back down at some point.That said, those tools will be useful in a variety of ways in the future.Think of it like the internet boom, sure they‚Äôll be a lot of pets.com companies using AI that crash and burn. Ultimately it‚Äôll find its place in the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 01:28:01'] Well there are moonshots.People have mentioned dotcom but if you look at AMZN's all time chart, it's 1376x.$1000 in 1997 turns into $1.37mil today.If someone invested in 100 different dotcom companies, $1000 each, and all of them failed except for AMZN, that's still 100k -> 1.37mil or over 10% p.a (and AMZN hasn't moved for 5 years)So if we assume AI is similar to dotcom, then hitting a big win AI company will hopefully lead to a huge payout.NVDA and MSFT are the least risky AI plays because even if AI is somehow unprofitable, they still have their existing profitable businesses.Also, why do people think MSFT and NVDA should be priced by only valuing only their existing business? While assigning $0 to AI.Lottery tickets cost money and call options cost money. The probability of additional profits in the future is worth something today.The lottery ticket is worth $0 only after it's been played.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 02:41:16'] Nvidia is years away from making any significant money from AI yet the market prices Nvidia as if they could maintain a 35% growth rate for the next ten years whilst also keeping great margins. It's not impossible but it's extremely optimistic. Considering the current economic environment and Nvidias inventory stockpiling and the China Taiwan risk, whoever buys Nvidia at this current price is just extremely bad at math and risk management. The downside risk for the next year or months is much higher than the chances to the upside. Besides as with any new tech, the real winners in the long run will rarely be the ones who were there at the start.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 20:03:47'] I think it‚Äôs more than AI. Nvidia is also boosted by the price of crypto and FAANG seems to be a flight to safety position with the current bank/liquidity issues. Maybe throw in quarterly rebalancing as well. Personally I simply would not touch these at their multiples in a 5% risk free environment but I understand their ‚Äústance‚Äù in the current market. Reminds me of when Costco tÔøºraded at 42x earnings because it was the queen of inflation hedges. Notice too that investors will flat out ignore their earnings and guidance. I don‚Äôt see any holes in the armor yet. TLDR: I‚Äôm a big believer in sector rotation/positioning

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 05:08:43'] It‚Äôs the bubble of this year. Not saying it won‚Äôt have effect down the roads and isn‚Äôt important.Ai has been around for a decade. Lots of companies use it one way or another. Chat -gpt isn‚Äôt Skynet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:17:50'] AI isn't just Chat GPT, although that one is in the news a lot lately. On the hardware side, Nvidia, Arista Networks, IBM, Intel, AMD (Xilinx), and probably more that I'm not aware of are all making AI hardware. On the software side, you have companies like Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and many others all integrating generative AI into their products. The AI market is expected to grow at a 37% compound annual growth rate from 3.3 billion in 2021 to 16 billion in 2026, according to Goldman Sachs. But most pure AI companies are currently privately held, which makes investing challenging. Honestly though, AI is a revolution in the same way that the Internet was a revolution. It will impact everyone's life. It would be smart to invest in it at an early stage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:24:08'] I‚Äôm super happy that the collective moved from shilling blockchain (an environmental disaster that in 10+ years hasn‚Äôt found a problem to it‚Äôs solution) to AI, which is making a profound impact on productivity immediately. NVDA is selling pickaxes during a gold rush. Despite their PE, I don‚Äôt think they are a bad investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 11:42:24'] Until I see NVDA and MSFT ballooning up and everyone outside of the stock market is talking about them and AI, it's not a bubble. Until it reaches Gamestop levels in the media, pop culture, etc. it's not a bubble. Remember that these companies are blue chippers anyway. So no reason not to have little bit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 11:47:56'] Is it a bubble if these companies are still trading well under where they were last bubble? Not every sector with momentum is a bubble
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 12:25:24'] The "boom" in "AI" we are experiencing now is similar to the NFT and Crypto craze we had for the past few years. The same grifters who glomed onto those crazes are the same one pushing it now, even if its met with overwhelming negative responses. The AI investments banks on being the future of technology while ignoring all of its glaring problems, development time, and myriad of legal issues. ChatGPT is useful in certain cases, mostly mathematical or programming, but look at the amount of people trying to argue politics with it. The community around it barely understand it. They just now it's *something*. It's most defiantly a test of blind faith. I will not be surprise if it crashes and burns like crypto did, especially when the main push for AI right now is creating amalgamations of art based on databases of copyrighted work illegally collated without permission of the creators.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 05:01:50'] ChatGPT is the biggest technology breakthrough in the last 30 years. Once you look at the capabilities you realize the level of human intelligence it has. No doubt marketeers and investors are going to generate another bubble but that is unrelated to the technology. Blockchain has no useful benefits to society today and it was pushed as a promise. ChatGPT is real, it is something we've never seen before and can scale super fast.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 00:57:13'] The bubble could take years to pop. Technology is finicky like that. If you look back at the .com bubble - it‚Äôs major run up started in 1998, however it didn‚Äôt bottom out until 2001-2002. This is because everyone realized the internet would be the next big thing (like AI) but there are a lot of unknowns. Who will succeed, how profitable, etc. A company could come out tomorrow with a huge breakthrough in AI hardware or software, which I believe would cause many of the other companies to fall. Or there could be a few lackluster earnings reports, and many investors may lose patience and look to put their capital towards companies with better results, especially during a time of economic uncertainty. It‚Äôs difficult to price something that is almost completely unknown, so I suspect there will be wild price action for a while. You are best off DCA into Nasdaq if you believe in the future of AI as there is no way of knowing who will win/lose. Betting against the success of AI isn‚Äôt smart and it isn‚Äôt investing - it‚Äôs gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 04:11:49'] It seems overvalued, but there's a potential huge upside - at some point truly exponential growth may set in, and to have stakes at AI companies at that point would be very profitable.However, the longer this exponential growth is not visible, there's a risk of the bubble popping.Currently the models are OK for generic tasks, but not that great for more specialised ones. I'd be interested to see how good would a potential model be at learning new information from e.g. company-specific internal data source (documentation, etc.). Of course information like that is minuscule in comparison to the datasets LLMs are normally trained on, and so potentially it might still not do that great.Also there's an issue of accuracy - sure, the model may be impressive at times, but that doesn't account for much if you can't really trust it - there has to be a person fact-checking and overseeing the output anyway. It might speed up some processes, but people may be blindsided by how impressive it appears, vs how useful it actually is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 05:28:40'] These tools are going to be disruptive. They are not going to talk to us and form ideas, they are going to compute rational responses using a catalog of human thought and work. While this won‚Äôt be Skynet, at least not yet, it will require an entire population to learn how to use them. They appear to be poised to become useful in search, writing, publication, art and creative design, and probably a few unseen uses.If you work in those fields or with those fields you will probably feel the impact sooner than the general population, kinda like touch screens that were used in industry far before practical home uses. It is funny, schools will respond quickly. They will probably begin to use these tools and teach about these tools‚Ä¶ and within 10 years anyone who hasn‚Äôt taught themselves these tools will find themselves at the beginning of a curve not unlike what we see today with ‚Äúboomers‚Äù and they saw with people being unwilling to learn computers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 07:26:50'] We use AI heavily for accounts payable and data entry. It's an incredibly helpful tool. Some of the platforms still need work (many do), but it's becoming increasingly common in day to day life. A lot of people think of AI as interactive robots, and although those exist, AI is common and useful in smaller spaces you wouldn't think of as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 07:30:31'] Its certainly hype but also keep in mind this hyped up moment is coming off a large valuation haircut.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 09:41:06'] You clearly haven't used any of the current offerings. Bing can easily be more useful than Google now for information and news based searches. You can go to bing chat, type "was bailing out credit suisse good or bad" and Bing will compile a pretty damn unbiased, nuanced answer, and cite its sources so you can go double check. That alone has major implications for online search and if perfected, could help search bias become extinct while helping to accurately inform users on their platform.

POST_TEXT: b"I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.\n\nNVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  \n\nI like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated."
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 20:01:40'] Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:Revenue:NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)Gross Profit:NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)Income Before Taxes:NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).Net Income:NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 01:21:22'] As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.That said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 03:48:59'] My personal opinion is that most analysts and investors aren't that into electronics and tech and dont see the upcoming potential of AMD.We saw huge impact in the CPU marked with AMDs chiplet technology and following AMDs roadmap its the plan to do the same thing in the GPU market. The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.This leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.Also AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.For me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.I think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 19:50:52'] Look at net income.553m vs 1.46bProfit = Revenue - Expenses
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 20:07:45'] AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 20:27:31'] Simply said look at their businesses as well. Speculate forward.What is next for AMD, producing a better chip ? Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.What is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''Looks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.Which company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.Disclaimer, i own fuck ton of both equally.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 03:52:56'] Smart money likes to keep retail investor with FUD, so retail will sell low buy high. They can easily manipulate the stock since all stands to gain if they keep the stock low enough to accumulate enough position before letting the retail investor knows that AMD is actually good and everyone should buy. Then they sell to those eager retail and the cycle begins again
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 02:47:40'] I think there‚Äôs a big elephant in the room that no one is talking about. Market cap = share count * share priceAmd is about to print a large amount of shares to purchase Xilinx. This means their market cap should increase even at a stable share price. AMD will by 74% amd stockholders, 26% Xilinx stock holders.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 19:48:18'] NVDA GPUs are, and have been, the industry standard. AMD just starting to take up some more market share with Ryzen and Thread ripper. NVDA market cap is about 3.5x bigger than AMD. NVDA revenue is 16b vs AMDs 10b. They also do a whole lot more. Including AI, Neural Net, and computing for self driving. They have both powerful cpu and gpu chips. Not only does NVDA have more going on right now, they also have a stronger future roadmap for growth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 21:05:36'] Both companies are highly overvalued....the question is which one has more future potential/risk?  NVidia GPUs reliably outsell AMD GPUs, but lets call that a wash....AMD CPUs beat intel lately(usually not forever), but have super high margins so not very profitable and both chips are likely to be made obsolete by ARM based CPUs from apple and now Nvidia if they make the ARM acquisition....and that's the big one, if Nvidia gets into the CPU race, offering an Apple M1 like product for windows, that's a big hit to AMD(and intel).  Nvidia network compute growth has almost matched it's graphics in just a couple years, so the hype is strong...AMD is kinda running out of steam after beating Intel down the last few years.  given a long enough time period, both will likely meet their price valuations and even go higher, but in a shorter term they are very risky to any market correction.  I will add, AMD does not have a dividend unlike Nvidia(or Intel) so it's a bit harder to hold for very long periods.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 22:08:58'] I‚Äôd say give it a few more years  for them to surpass Nvidia. AMD was always the budget room heater until ryzen and the graphics cards timed with the early ryzen releases were meh. A lot of new architecture they haven‚Äôt yet mastered
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 04:13:36'] NVDA is an innovative company with trustworthy growth prospects.AMD is an historical fuckup that got lucky in a couple of big ways and barely avoided a bankruptcy.But the biggest reason they're valued differently is that NVDA is vastly more profitable, making as much net profit in a quarter as AMD makes in a year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 19:46:39'] I believe NVDA makes software for self driving cars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-03 22:57:56'] AMD has a lot of comparatively low margin console contracts. Those are good for revenue and pays off a lot of overhead but just isn't as high margin as standalone GPUs or CPUs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 01:40:26'] They shit money
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 02:46:41'] Look at free cash flow and EBITDA. Nvidia is a fair bit higher. I kind of eye balled it but it looked around 4x higher over past 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 04:25:52'] At this point in time if you want to be serious about machine learning/ai. You are going to use a nvidia card. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, facebook, salesforce, all using nvidia cards for their machine learning needs. It boils down to software support for nvidia over amd. There's no reason why  amd cannot make their software suite better. But nvidia cards are the industry standard. Idk too much about the gaming market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 14:23:24'] For a market correction to happen the big stocks have to fall. When they fall they will bring the whole market down with it
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 16:30:51'] If there were a market correction, it would be precisely because these are the companies that are correcting as they make up the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 15:57:05'] Mega cap tech are unstoppable. When the prices dip, expect them to increase their buybacks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 15:17:09'] Most of these tech companies depends heavily on their potential so their "fair price" is equivalent to what people think they will make on the future, not what they are now.Apple and Microsoft are so entrenched in their positions you will probably need something close to a crash to affect them.Nvidia is a lot more vulnerable because a lot of their stuff are riding on their future gains or possible mergers. Any of those could fail and cause their stock to tumble down the hole. They had a good ride with the grow of crypto but they knew it wouldn't last so they are hoping to diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 14:36:34'] A market correction scenario is not unlikely, in fact it's inevitable.. Having said that,  a company like Apple or MSFT will weather the storm and come out OK, but NVidia will take a harder fall
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:36:02'] Price to book ratios (accounting for their cash) are still very high. They don‚Äôt have much of a rational support past a certain level, although they definitely won‚Äôt drop as much as others that don‚Äôt make any money. And as another poster said well: these companies *are* the market. So a SPX correction would mean that these companies themselves are correcting.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 16:05:50'] During low interest rates these types of high PE companies are given an infinite runway, but when things crash nothing beats a recurring check-in-hand.People can assure you, convince you everyone is fully rational during a collapse, but in this 'everything bubble' people will once again assume the sky is falling and that its the end of modern civilization as we know it.My guess is Apple would drop at minimum in half, and Nvidia far more than that.  Historically now would be the time to be buying deep value stocks with inelastic demand, Intel, fertilizer, and utility companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 18:18:13'] Just FYI Tesla has over $20b cash and is the 5th largest position in SPY by market cap. I'm heavy Tesla and QQQM because I don't think you can go wrong with these companies. Even if there's a correction the underlying businesses are generating a lot of revenue, yes even Tesla with 30%+ gross margins with 50%+ CAGR. These businesses don't have debt and can stay afloat, which is what I anticipate will outperform the rest of the market for 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 15:00:42'] I think apple and Microsoft is in a different league in terms of cash
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 15:13:35'] Microsoft has always get a full years payroll in cash to weather a down year.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 05:20:07'] NVDA is long hold. And given the popularity I‚Äôm sure post stock split it will see a spike from people buying it at a more ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 15:34:53'] Why did you buy the stock in the first place? If you‚Äôre holding long term this split shouldn‚Äôt even matter to you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 15:56:24'] Nobody ever lost money taking profits. If you feel like they're overvalued, sell and try buy back at a lower price. Otherwise, just hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 16:15:26'] I know people goin to buy after the split just because it's more affordable.It's a long, long hold for me, ill only add to.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 21:01:45'] Hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 21:43:19'] Look at the recent stocks stock splits such as apple and tesla. See how the run up is and post stock split is. To avoid FOMO or regrets, you can sell half and keep half for a bit to see if keeps up with a short run up after. IMO, i think there will be another run up post split, but the growth will plateau
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 03:47:46'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 15:39:04'] Depends on if you need the money now or later. NVDA splits stock often so its just going to make you more money for years to come. If you can wait, hold. If you cant, take the money now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 16:19:02'] I'm no expert but a stock split shouldn't affect your current position by much if at all. So you have 15 shares at 745, an 11,175 value. After a 1:2 stock split you will have 30 shares at 372.5, still a 11,175 value. You're still working with the same value, just more units of a smaller value. Stock splits only really affect your decisions if your planning to buy more or actively trading it.   were you going to sell it soon anyways? then sell it. were you going to keep holding it? then hold it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 16:00:19'] I believe after stock splits the stock will rise quite a bit before consolidating. Might be good to let it split and then sell the rip

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 07:29:16'] Would hold.   More shares for you and more people will probably buy because it's cheaper.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 08:35:02'] I bought one a few days ago and will add on more after the split. I expect people who have been turned away at the current price are waiting till the split to jump in. Some just are not into the idea of partial shares and would like to at least start at owning 1. The split would help that. I‚Äôve always liked the company and it has always been in my plans to jump in. I just got tired of seeing it constantly go up with me on the sideline. I‚Äôll be holding long. That said, profit is profit, so don‚Äôt feel bad if you need to make that move or there‚Äôs another stock you‚Äôre looking to move the money into.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 08:35:06'] I'm holding, been since around 2016 or so gonna hold for the next 5 years at least and probably much longer.Great stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 09:34:14'] Keep holding.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 18:49:32'] I would sell. Big run up pre split similar to Tesla and Expi. Both dropped massively after.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 20:45:40'] Splits are typically a bullish indicator. I wouldn‚Äôt sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 03:39:01'] TSLA showed us stock split is the 2021 version of infinite money glitch.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 18:34:49'] You could look at TTD. They did a 10:1 split either Thursday or Friday. It immediately went up a couple of bucks. I think NVDA is a better company than TTD and would hold through the split. The only reason I can think of to sell NVDA is if the Arm acquisition doesn‚Äôt work out. And even then I‚Äôm still bullish long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 19:56:05'] Ok so let‚Äôs look at recent stock splits lol. Tesla and Apple what happened ? Now that‚Äôs go back to when Berkshire Hathaway did a stock split what happened? In fact it made Warren Buffett say he‚Äôll never do a stock split again even if his stock goes to millions ! Hope this answers your question. The recent boom in nvda is because the stock split and the banks will sell before. So that means you always sell with the banks. Theirs always better opportunities down the road. Sell now and take your profits ! Unless your long if your long then take some profits and rebuy a few days later when it drops drastically.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 11:46:25'] Sell during the split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 20:50:18'] Advanced Micro Devices will be worth more than Nvidia in 10 years you can mark that down.  Sue Lee > Jensung
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 06:17:59'] I own 3 nvidia stocks I sold after the run up it had. Whenever a stock runs up that much, especially for a company with a huge mrkt cap I'll sell to lock in profits. I do expect it to dip post earnings because alot of people think "oh if it splits itll be cheaper and more retailers will buy it" and that's not the best take. If the news is itll split that means smart money is buying it now, to make a quick buck so that when retailers buy it come post split they'll dump there shares the week after. Happened with tesla. And not saying it usually happens but this seems to be in the same direction. If it's a forever stock to you I wouldnt sell all of it. Tldr: if a stock moves up because of nothing news never a bad idea to take profit/trim

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 20:39:00'] On paper, stock splits shouldn't matter.  In reality, they sometimes do.  However stocks tend to be influenced more by other factors than the split.  Against my education and training, I'm actually hoping for a split in AMZN.  It's a bit prohibitive in the $3000-4000 range, and I'm optimistic the new leader is more ruthless and pragmatic about the share price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 20:52:32'] Continue to hold (or if you‚Äôre really itching to free up capital sell 5 of the highest cost shares - at most). If you don‚Äôt need the cash for a specific other position that has better long-term prospects than holding NVDA shares with a cost basis ($250) below current market price, and if your  long-term thesis about the *company* hasn‚Äôt changed, then there‚Äôs no reason to sell. NVDA not a vulnerable spec play, you‚Äôre golden.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 09:33:24'] If you're comfortable with liquidating the shares and then buying them back as you kinda say, sell them now n buy em back after the correction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 11:48:33'] Often stocks gain ahead of a split, then drop right after the split as traders take some profits, then after a month or two, they are again at parity and continue the momentum that induced the split.BUT... unless you are feeling stress about the overall health of the market, the potential to be wrong on a particular trade may not be worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 14:24:23'] Keep holding. I think it has room to run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-20 19:13:50'] Long long term hold. The one thing that I never see anyone mention is that the Android TV devices they make blow all others and Amazon devices completely out of the water. Their devices were being scalped for 3x the MSP during the pandemic. I think people cutting the cord is something big that will drum up a lot of business for them.

POST_TEXT: b'tock: Nvidia\n\nTicker: $NVDA\n\n**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** \n\nTo begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\n\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\n\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billion'
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 22:53:34'] This sits well with my investing strategy. I see a ticker name I recognize on a forum post then I invest in that stock with little to no further research.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 23:08:24'] Since growth stocks often trade at higher ratios, a helpful indicator in order to find out whether investors are pricing in just growth (as it should be) or also euphoria is the historical PE ratio.The current PE ratio for NVDA is about 80. In the last 10 years the minimum was 12.79, the median 31.09 and the maximum 96.39. For the PE ratio to get back to median value there are two possibilities, either the company grows faster than expected (quite difficult since a generous growth has already been priced in) or the share price falls.Hope I give you another perspective on the NVDA valuation!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 07:22:20'] Here is my constructive feedback and saying this all in a nice way. Half your analysis is explaining EBITDA and other metrics. People can Google what EBITDA is and how it‚Äôs calculated if they don‚Äôt know. It made your write up longer than it needed to be. Also, you flip flop back and forth in numbers (billions and millions). I don‚Äôt think NVidia has 19782 billion is cash, I think you are missing a period after the 9 maybe. Also, use commas (or a space depending on where you are located in the world) between thousands (19,782 for instance). It‚Äôs so difficult to quickly understand the number without commas. Sorry to harp so much on format, but if format is no good people will not respect the content of your analysis. Another example is when you say Nvidea 5 year growth is 1.401%. I assume you mean 1,401%. Any analysis you post publicly should be much tighter formatting/reviewed. Good luck in your investing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 01:40:13'] Nice work, what i am missing in DD to be complete is a bear case and company's strength, regardless of price. Let me illustrate with an example -- we know that GPU market aint going nowhere, but the field I see NVDA in is also AI -- they have actually an amazing research team, and deep learning is almost exclusively run on nvda gpus (by retail) -- there could be possible margins there aswell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 22:58:40'] I don't quite understand why people compare valuation ratios with the industry average. Isn't it possible the entire sector is in a bubble? This is a genuine question. I would appreciate an answer.GPU crypto mining is more likely to die out than to grow. As far as I know, no new crypto project uses Proof of Work. That leaves us with Bitcoin and its cousins. If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.For gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.I welcome critical comments.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 05:34:22'] "Price Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows." Lol, I love it - &#x200B;I like the stock! I liked the technical analysis post, but would recommend posting a chart to go with it. Some good info here, overall.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 06:57:22'] So you entire case is built on the notion that the EV/EBITDA is lower than the industry average?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 22:52:25'] Price target $300-$500 on what timeframe? A year? This stock has already shot way past its fundamentals. Nearing 100X EV/EBITDA makes me fear for the markets as a whole.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 21:59:17'] NVDA is a great long-term play. Whether we see 20% growth or more over the next year or not is negligible in my eyes. I will stay with them for the foreseeable future unless something drastic happens. Not a company you can go wrong with at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 10:25:10'] >Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn‚Äôt as black and white, but that‚Äôs the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.In the short amount of time, e.g. daily trading, human psychology may convert or is more or less unanimous. And that can be captured neatly in a stock's price.But stock price is one dimensional.  Over a long period of time, the psychology on why someone or some institution buys or sells a stock becomes complicated.   The one dimensional stock price cannot possibly capture the psychology behind buying and selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 06:00:23'] My critique of this DD is that it is not finished! You have done a great job at what you've done so far, and it's a really good base to perform a more thorough valuation, but there is more digging to be had here. The most important thing is trying to figure out how much money you think the business will make over time. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but there should always be a rough idea of how much you expect them to make. When you do this, it's important to factor in the risk of the business going under or being outcompeted (make sure you discount that from how much money you expect them to make). Also it's really important to understand how their business works. Personally, I know nothing about tech, but this could be a great play for someone who understands the industry better than me. Basically I think you've done a great job here, but you have more work to do! What I'd recommend you do from here is skim more quarterly and annual reports to see how they work on the more minute levels. Anyhow, you're doing amazing, keep up the good work! (:

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/microsoft-raises-price-of-xbox-live-gold-by-1-a-month-1846108641/amp\n\nMicrosoft removed their 12 month option for Xbox Live, and now only have up to a 6 month option priced at $59.99. This is double what the price for Xbox Live used to be.\n\nTo this day, Xbox remains the only console that requires an Xbox Live membership to play free-to-play games, including games such as Warzone.\n\nPC gaming was already on the rise, I ditched my Xbox last year to build a PC of my own, but this imo would catalyze the migration off console towards PC gaming even further. \n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: So Im editing this as of 1/23 to add that Microsoft has done a complete 180 and decided no membership will be needed to play free to play games, and no price hike on Xbox Live either! I was almost shocked they flipped on this so quickly lol. Thanks for everyones inputs!\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/23/22245630/microsoft-xbox-live-gold-price-'
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 08:43:37'] This is why you use Bing üëÜ to get years of this Gold membership for free. I've been doing it for around the last 5 years, never had to pay for Gold and never will.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 08:44:27'] Most likely. Everyone(including myself) can agree that the pricing is unfair and this is gonna hurt business quite a lot unless they have something up their sleeve
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 08:54:43'] I understand a price increase, but double? 70 a year is a better bet... xbox already lost ground with the xbone v. PS4 idiotic move to double live prices.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:47:28'] I think this is missing a key point. They are moving away from gold and going towards Gamepass(imo a better service anyways). $5/mo gets you regular gamepass $15/mo gets you ultimate which includes gold, gamepass and GP for pc. They aren't looking to push customers away from the system they are looking for GP subs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:31:09'] Their games pass offering is one of the best deals around though.  100+ games, EA Play, PC games included too. Well worth $15 a month if you're a gamer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:37:24'] As a gamer, i already thought that Xbox gold was stupid & expensive, now i think it's a clown fiesta
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 08:46:23'] I've been an Xbox simp since the 360. Definitely solidified that I'm switching to a PS5 when my xbox live subscription runs out in July.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 09:12:37'] Wtf is this. That's why subscriptions and Microsoft sucks! You're stuck with the device. Have to pay. In office they would target Slack and bundle Teams for "free" until Slack is no more. Nadela, I thought this shit is past Msft.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 10:28:59'] Why pay for Gold and not just gamepass ultimate, it is like 4 dollars more and so worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 15:08:23'] bleeding people dry with expensive subscriptions, expensive games, expensive micro-transactions and accessories. I'm continuing to be bullish on PC gaming. I put an additional ¬£200 into Corsair. It's sort of been beaten down recently for no good reason and they are reporting earnings soon. I'm expecting a blowout earnings for them, they have so much going for them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:16:32'] Why do you think it is bull for PC's lol. If anything it is bullish for MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 13:22:33'] This makes a lot of sense - Xbox Game Pass is the future. They're pricing that in. üìà
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 09:16:52'] I was billed 59.99 for a 12 month subscription on Dec 2020. Are they gunna charge me more now or just 120 when this expires in Dec 2021?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 10:31:42'] I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre including game pass with the subscription
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:46:00'] This is probably to make their Games Pass more attractive. But with Xcloud also coming to PC this year, PC is definitely still on the rise. Xcloud coupled with Games Pass Ultimate is an insanely good deal for even people without an Xbox.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:18:45'] I don't think it would have that much of an effect.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:09:20'] I‚Äôve been weighing my options and reading about AMD‚Äôs ER. I want to do a credit spread with the 2/19 91.5p and 95c but can‚Äôt pull the trigger.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:31:16'] Built my pc this summer for this reason too.Kids and those who want plug and play will still buy these memberships but yeeesh glad I can play whatever I want without stupid subscriptions
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:42:51'] It's to force people onto Game Pass Ultimate, which frankly, they should already have picked up on their own. I don't think it'll be long before it's gone. Fortunately Game Pass Ultimate is a great deal.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 13:25:32'] FUCK U XBOX wow
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 13:46:53'] I‚Äôm not paying that. I‚Äôll be fine to play offline games and stream from other device. I‚Äôm not paying $100 bucks for the couple games I play to play online. So you want me to pay $500 for your new device and then $100.Bring back the family/group package so I can get a discount.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 13:49:46'] I'd say even more bull case for Atari's stock $PongFAtari just released a new game console- [Shop.AtariVCS.com](https://Shop.AtariVCS.com) which is also PC based.:)
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 14:36:34'] I think all the companies you mention will soon raise their price as well, there are already shortages for hardware and they will gladly do it. People who can afford to buy hardware will certainly be able to afford price hike,
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 15:22:25'] This is fucking robbery. Glad I switched to PSN. Offering Ultimate was a good deal, this is just MSFT up to their old dirty tricks of forcing you into something less valuable for more money. As a consumer, it‚Äôs disappointing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 17:05:30'] They are pushing people into Game Pass - my xbox game pass account was just transferred over to my PC for free. I'm not sure what the deal with that is but its actually pretty amazing. I won't pretend to know about their userbase but Game Pass with kids has got to be pretty amazing. Especially with an Xbox and a PC, if what happened to me is the norm. Its actually saved me a fair amount of money that would have went to games, on Xbone and PC (just on pc: Doom Eternal, Phoenix Point, Gears Tactics, and Outerworlds). Oddly enough, Game Pass may actually give PC gaming a good nudge of positive growth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 20:30:51'] CRSR just put out a new public offering, so it may take a few weeks to keep gains
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-23 06:42:44'] Looks like the people have spoken and Microsoft got their head out of their ass. No xbox live price change and free to play games like warzone and fortnite are not going to need a live account

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-23 07:20:06'] Maybe this is being done because of the gold to ultimate exploit?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-23 15:00:18'] Buy Microsoft. All this info of a price increase tells you is that MSFT just doubled the revenues from that stream.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-23 15:17:21'] At the end of the day Microsoft doesn't care if people use Xbox Live or PC, as long as it takes away market share from SONY.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 09:16:18'] Now I will never get an Xbox lmaoooo would‚Äôve been an amazing secondary to my PS5
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 09:16:45'] But yet MSFT is up 2% on the day, 6% in 2 days.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:05:35'] [removed]
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 11:39:44'] They're doing this because all live memberships will have Game Pass built in, so technically it's cheaper.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 12:21:45'] I feel like if you're buying MSFT because of Xbox you might be buying for the wrong reasons. I don't think is indicative of anything.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 13:39:27'] Everyone is on Gamepass. Who gives a shit about Gold.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 18:13:43'] Crypto and metaverse were both solutions looking for a problem that didn‚Äôt really exist.  So I never invested in those hype stocks/assets directly.  LLM AI on the other hand has real world applications and is already disrupting many white collar  jobs.  For now, betting on Nvidia (the proverbial guy selling shovels during the gold rush) is a smart bet.  But longer term I expect the need for expensive GPUs to diminish as the training cost (for LLM models) decreases due to smarter training algorithms. We‚Äôre already seeing techniques like LoRA that‚Äôs allowing models to be trained at fraction of the original cost.  So I don‚Äôt think Nvidia is a smart bet long term for Ai, but think Ai will be around for a while (who knows which LLM AI will prevail), and it remains to be seen if the societal disruption from LLM leads to net a positive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 15:06:54'] I think the best plan for people in these stocks is setting a stop loss or buying puts to limit potential downside, without capping upside. There is no way of knowing if this persists, or for how long. As someone who isn‚Äôt in ‚ÄúAI stocks‚Äù, I won‚Äôt touch direct exposure with a hundred foot pole. In these situations, somebody is getting wrecked, and we have no way of knowing whether that will be to the upside or to the downside. My ‚ÄúAI‚Äù strategy is investing in businesses which will benefit significantly from application. As examples, I‚Äôd point out the impact that Palantir had on UK distribution of vaccines, and the benefit that BP Oil saw immediately through Palantir‚Äôs Foundry software. This isn‚Äôt a Palantir plug. It‚Äôs a call out around the power of improving data inputs and velocity around decision making, which are significant benefits of AI. I would expect energy, financials, and supply chain/distribution to be significant beneficiaries over the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 17:11:08'] Are you mostly in stocks like NVDA and NOW, or are there other AI plays you‚Äôre making?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 18:53:56'] It‚Äôs difficult to come to a conclusion considering we, and likely these corporations, do not know how AI tech will unfold.I‚Äôd suspect with current prices, any near term benefits are priced in. That doesn‚Äôt mean the prices won‚Äôt continue shooting up. I‚Äôm my opinion, AI is a momentum play right now. The tech is real, the corporate benefits are a guess.It‚Äôs the internet 2.0‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 06:49:05'] Is there hype?? Yes, too muchWas tech undervalued?? YesIt is now a bit overvalued?? Yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:58:00'] It'll probably be a few weeks or months before the reality of AI starts to take shape and valuations crater to realistic expectations.Think TSLA going to a trillion. It's down 40% from that and still overvalued, but the initial bubble of fomo popped and a ton of people lost a ton of money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 16:47:41'] over hyped. Is the debt ceiling crashes the market when returning people probably forget these hyped stocks.  It is another cloud, spacs, weeds, 5G.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 14:21:52'] Apparently, there will be once again a .com like crash. No matter what, I guess NVDA and AMD would be good bets :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 17:41:33'] PLTR has jumped 43% over the past two weeks, because of Cathie Wood, a rather questionable decision maker, and the Nvidia hype. I understand the hype about Nvidia, but Palantir isn‚Äôt as established as Nvidia. While I have faith in Palantir long-term, I think there will be some pullback. I mean, it‚Äôs soaring at IPO-levels. You‚Äôre in a vastly different interest rate environment compared to when it just IPO‚Äôed. A recession is looming, and expectations for rate hikes have shifted for the worse. Oh, and there‚Äôs political posturing over the debt ceiling that will put people on edge.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 00:01:48'] It‚Äôs not all hype. There‚Äôs a reason chat gpt changed things. It showed that contextual search and LLMs are ready to help productivity. And the reach is everywhere. Imagine toys that can have a conversation with you about your favorite color or movie. Imagine Alexa or Siri actually being useful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 16:04:39'] will go up and stay flat and then go up some more
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:14:52'] They will probably keep running on momentum. Don't go short, people shorting NVDA today are like the people that shorted TSLA in its 2020 bullrun

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 20:25:28'] Even without the partnership $NOW is a great company to own. Steadily rising ROIC, stable and high revenue growth, founder still involved, considered critical infrastructure by many of their clients, 98% gross retention rate, etc.If you‚Äôre interested in AI companies though I feel like Tesla is the most overlooked opportunity in the space. They are the farthest ahead in real world AI. Meaning AI that actually interacts with the real world and isn‚Äôt just text based. If they manage to solve FSD not only will that save lives but it will transfer over to Optimus which itself has a massive TAM. It‚Äôs amazing what the bot is already able to do comparing 2021 when it was first revealed to now. And it will be very cheap to produce and scale. It‚Äôs probably atleast 10 years out from this of course but the opportunity alone makes tesla a great one to take a bet on in the AI space

I was in college at the time but everyone had Netflix.  2008-2009 it was almost non existent for most but by 2011 it was HUGE amongst the college population. My reasoning was simply, if everyone we know has it/uses it and the stock just dropped 75%, when is a better time to buy?I was in the investment club in college and really enjoyed the thought of day trading. I begged my parents for some money and they basically said I had to hold onto whatever I bought for at least 1 year rather than day trading.

I held til early 2021 when I quit and boy did I outpace all major ETF's during that period. Let alone some half baked crooks taking 1% off the top to invest in VOO for me

I can recall around July 2021 when the stock was ~$110 and thinking about how their business model was brilliant during COVID lockdowns/restrictions but it made absolutely no sense in a post-COVID world. Pricey home workout equipment with a subscription fee? Hell no! The value proposition of a home gym is (largely) to avoid monthly fees!Shorted it at ~$110s and slowly secured gains before entirely exiting the trade at around $14ish, and I also had some LEAP puts.

It had crashed down all the way from over $110 or something. One of my buddies was a gaming analyst at a large investment bank, and he said it was way too oversold and the company was not going bankrupt, like investors were predicting. Also, I had just went to Macau and checked out their newest casino, and it was freaking packed. It was the largest casino in Macau at the time, and business was absolutely thriving. Should've been enough confirmation for me but I passed on investing.My buddy ended up investing $5K or $10K and did a 5X in a few months. LVS ended up going up to like $50 in a year or two... Yeh, I'm not sure if I would've held on for that long, but still sucks haha.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 20:21:19'] When the Spectre and Meltdown mitigation attacks were first publicly revealed, the understanding at the time (from what I remember) was that these exploits weren't known to effect AMD CPUs; then it was revealed that Intel had been alerted to the potential exploits almost a year earlier. Combining these reveals with their continued inability to surmount the problems with their next node made them look (to me) like the semiconductor version of the "[this is fine](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine)" meme. Meanwhile, AMD was finally recovering from the well-intentioned, but disastrous "Bulldozer" architecture with its first "Zen" CPUs; their stock was sitting somewhere around $10. I tried to tell my dad (since I was just a poor college student) to immediately start buying as much AMD stock as possible.He never did.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:25:47'] Tesla, Nividia, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon. Basically just all the hyped tech stocks.They all had (or were close to) Trillion dollar valuations which were either completely unsustainable or simply didn't allow any room for stock growth because they'd already 'priced in' the next 10 years.The whole point of investing in equities (and especially individual stocks) is to get a good return. How on earth did people think these companies could sustain their insane P/E ratios AND get other investors to buy in (i.e. get them a return) whilst they're on the way to doing it? At best, they'd be able to maintain the peak, but there no way they could just keep climbing. They were priced like startups.Their valuations were basically predicated on massive and unfettered growth. To justify them, *everything* was going to have to go right, which was just never going to happen.I was saying all this about 2 years ago and continuously downvoted for it and accused of 'timing the market'. Queue 6 months later and everyone's moaning about being 50% down.

I decided to invest it in Tesla as I knew a lot about the company, Must, etc.I had no idea how to buy stocks and also I'm from Bulgaria, so things are not so easy as in the US (or eat least weren't back then). So I saw a banner ad on a website that said TRADE TESLA STOCK. I made an account and communicated with their support. It was some sort of futures only platform. You couldn't buy stocks - you could only bet on their movement and had to pay funding fee. The support, instead of telling me where to go buy stocks, told me that ain't happening in Bulgaria. So you guess what ... I still have the money in cash at home. Could have had it x20.

POST_TEXT: b'Have been doing some research regarding $NVDA.  Came across a stat that said about 1/2 of their revenue comes from GPU sales.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 01:49:41'] Think NVDA will be fine in the short/medium term.  Why I continue to have a material position long.But I do worry longer term.  I believe the future is more and more the big guys making their own chips.Google for example is doing their own in the Pixel 6 and will also start to offer Chromebooks with their own chips starting in 2023.Amazon is starting to do their own chips for their cloud.   Tesla is doing their own client AI chips in the cars.  But still using Nvidia for the back-end.I do not see this trend ending.    Because the industry has completely changed.   There was a time that Intel made the chips and Dell purchased and put in their servers and sold to an end company.   There was literally 10s of millions of companies buying the servers.Today it is more and more the servers come from Google, Amazon or Microsoft with their clouds.  It completely changes the calculus of the chip business.   Take the power needed to run the servers.  That was just not high on the list of features when the 10s of millions of companies were buying the servers.  But today with Google having literally millions and millions of servers it makes a huge difference to lower the power footprint.There was a time I was responsible for buying servers and I do not remember even considering the power footprint when we purchased.  We did the generation before with the mainframes because they needed special power and we had to make sure it was available.It is the reason Google created the TPUs.  They could not afford to run the hardware available at the time.   It is also a big reason that Google designed all their own network processors.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/"Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data CentersGoogle has detailed its TPU---and the tremendous savings that came with it."https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/The companies today have resources unlike companies of the past.   But they then also have the ROI with their massive infrastructure to justify designing and building their own chips.To me the place that is going to kill it is companies like TSMC that have the Fabs.  I do NOT think the Google's of the world are going to do their own FABs.  But I guess that could happen down the road.It is interesting to watch because I am really old and we are returning more and more to how things use to be.It is also why I own more GOOG than I do NVDA.  GOOG is just a lot safer for the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 01:10:04'] This is one of the most crucial points when we discuss about NVDA shareprice. As far as I surveyed, in 2017-2018 It was estimated to be around 50% of GPU cards are occupied by miners and now, analysts are estimating that the percentage is dropped to 25%. Plus, Nvidia is now selling Low Hash Rate cards and Coin Mining Processors so I believe that they can push down that number even lower from now. So my take on this issue is that I don't think coin mining is the wolf at the door. I worry more about data center demand because once all the companies buy AI chips for their servers, there will be a cycle where demand dwindles a lot. We won't be able to avoid that shareprice drop if that happens... üò§
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-06 23:39:48'] Nothing. That‚Äôs also how much they‚Äôre predicting revenue from mining sales are going to add to earnings growth for the rest of the year
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 08:04:50'] If NVDA doesn't get blocked from buying ARM, then they will be in a very good position. I'm super stoked about having more shares as a result of the recent stock split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-06 22:15:04'] Another point of $NVDA that is usually overlooked. A GPU is a very flexible device that was designed to run graphics. Graphics processing uses a lot of computational power. Which also makes it the perfect device for running AI. Regular CPUs, no matter how many cores they have, just cannot handle that workload. All driverless vehicles will need to run AI software to make their probability estimates and decisions quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-06 22:31:20'] Firstly, the bigger part of the NVDA bull case to me is their data center and AI business, a market that is expected to add something like 15 trillion (up from like 2) to the global economy by 2030. Secondly, gamers flock to buy a new GPU every few years as new ones come out and games improve. No different than buying a new phone or console.

Most don't like the concept of Proof-of-Stake because it's the anti-thesis of what Crypto is about; decentralization. POS requires 32 ETH to stake a pool, thats around $100k in ETH.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 03:32:48'] If they keep reasonable RRPs (so let's pretend the 3090 and 3080 ti aren't a thing and you'll actually be able to buy a 3080) they'll be fine. I'm certainly not getting some POS second hand card from eBay that's probably been stuck running full whack 24 7 in some dusty mining rig if the price of a new card is actually reasonable. Demand will still be fine. Also is that 50% of earnings RTX only or does it include Data centre cards?

POST_TEXT: b'NVDA is a beast of a stock that has seen a huge run up lately and will be split 4:1 in late July. Many anticipate a spike after the split since it could attract more investors. AMD has also been on a nice run but seems to be the better value of the two with more room to grow. Which of the two would you buy and why?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 16:45:01'] I‚Äôd hold both honestly. As others have said, AMD is taking more and more market share with their cpus, both consumer and data center. Nvidia has a HUGE AI benefit with their GPUs and I see that being a giant plus for their future as we move toward a more autonomous workforce. I‚Äôd probably go 60/40 NVDA/AMD
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 15:16:56'] Just here to comment that I own both in equal percentage in my portfolio! I love them both!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 22:32:40'] If you're holding NVDA already, lucky you. Personally, I would not buy NVDA right now when the stock is *this* hot. If it has a noticeable pullback, I might get in with a few shares in anticipation of the upcoming split, since stocks generally tend to do better after splits.AMD is also running quite hot right now, and a discount free cash flow valuation shows that it's well above what its intrinsic value should be. If I was looking to buy one of these, I'd wait for a pullback first.Of course, I'm saying this as someone who's currently holding INTC shares and utterly disappointed by how far this once-dominant CPU giant has fallen.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 15:28:14'] I own both and use both. I see better growth for AMD tech.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 16:08:49'] Learn as much as you can about both. This could be a very good example of Buffett‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat company at a fair price is better than a fair company at a great price.‚ÄùHowever, I also think that the XLNX acquisition is going to improve AMD significantly, and based on revenue projections and price multiples, the share price stands to have a solid, market-beating upward push over the 2022-2024 time frame. (This is the same math I used to predict its 2021 would leave something to be desired.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 15:28:03'] AMD no question, much lower multiples concerning P/E and price to free cash flow with more growth potential in my opinion, is destroying intel in gaining market share of CPU's and in data centers. NVDA is trading at a ridiculous multiple and has run up of the news of a split which doesn't change anything. I LOVE both COMPANIES but hate NVDA's stock. I could be missing something tho.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 21:14:27'] Why not both?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 21:46:34'] I would take Nvidia over AMD because of the potential ARM deal.  Low-power, massively-multi-core is the way of the future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 10:46:33'] NVDA for two reasons.In the AI/ML market, they are pretty much unparalleled.  nVidia's CUDA and their Telsa processors are industry standard, nobody else is even in the market!nVidia's recent purchase of ARM was a smart move.  A lot of cloud providers are looking at moving off of x86 and to ARM.  Even though the CPU doesn't say "nVidia" they'll be paying nVidia royalties.  I expect that to start blowing up, particularly because of the success of apple's M1 chip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 22:28:18'] AMD simply because Nvidia is so overvalued at the moment. It's hard to justify that valuation. Also, Intel is releasing a dedicated GPU which is more competition for nvidia. I'd still pick Intel over those two even if they were all valued at the same ratio. They have the better long term competitive advantage and the market is totally detached from this reality at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 07:52:02'] I have held AMD since $2.20 and I personally like the underdog aspect.  I realize that has nothing to do with how well they will perform, but it makes me happy.  They are hungry and are doing well at gathering market share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 18:48:17'] I like NVDA better as a company, even if their valuation is a little crazy right now.  AMD may be a better bargain at current prices.  But if the Arm deal goes through, NVDA is going to be unstoppable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 00:57:58'] I‚Äòd go with both for the longrun. But NVDA exploded (rightfully so) in the last weeks as AMD is catching up depressed and shorted to the titts because of the Xilinx deal. If ARM goes through NVDA will explode. If ARM goes through there is no reason to thinK Xilinx won‚Äòt go through and AMD will increase a good chunk as Xilinx will explode, because 1 xilinx will equal like 1,5 AMD shares diluting the over all share price of AMD while still increasing If that shit is behind us. They‚Äòre both great picks
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 01:21:12'] Both. However, NVDA's current valuations seem a little too stretched out for me. I would wait for the share split and see how it performs then. Arm's acquisition, the chances of it happening is around 30% at the moment, so that could be a wildcard. Regardless, extremely good company to own for the long term with the whole AI tailwind behind it. I love AMD for its tech advantage over Intel. Intel, despite changing CEOs recently, still is showing complacency with delays (one just announced yesterday). Moreover, there is a short-term potential catalyst of the Xilinx merger.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 18:14:46'] As companies, I think both of them as excellent long term and worth holding. Now as stocks, with a good entry price they both can be good. check out a fair value calculation for both companies to figure out your entry price, then set alarm and sleep on it. Let it come to you. I did that and was able to pick AMD at a good value around $80 just a few weeks ago. Now sadly the price has gone up before i could do all my buiying and i'll have to wait until it comes down again before buying. There are many other stocks out there to make money on so i'll keep this in my watch list.

I am adding if this dips in the morning.  If you can accumulate 25 shares, and the 4 for 1 split happens, you can sell calls on 100 shares later on.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-14 09:40:08'] This has been happening for quite a long time now, what Nvidia usually does is list some cards on their own website at MSRP (which sell out near instantly) but all their board partners that actually hold the supply sell the cards at significantly marked up prices to make themselves profitable. The prices have also obviously been exasperated by scalping and crypto miners. There is a strong case for Nvidia causing artificial scarcity by limiting the supply output and using reviewers to create hype for price gouging though. Not too sure about AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-14 12:29:23'] Everyone knows they have been jacking up their prices for the past year or 2. This isn‚Äôt as damning as you think
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-14 10:09:54'] How can they even fake the MSRP? They manufacture those cards, so they have every rights to pick the price. However, it's up to the merchants to determine the selling price. It's just a basic supply and demand. For favorable reviews, comparison, I think this is just BS. If you can read the card specs, you can clearly tell whether it's an improvement or not. Of course there'll be mixed reviews on same gen cards anyway.

I don't think the hype is that bad and guys like me look at the frame rate more and I doubt people want to lie with frame rate.Now the price gouging is a bit more tricky. We expected it when the mining but a lot of us enthusiasts tend to hold back and wait for the high-end cards to go down while the lower end cards are way more popular like the 2060.The strategy would work only with a monopoly. If AMD could undercut and outsell Nvidia to take back the throne then they would have done it. They have always been the budget underdog to Nvidia Ti line.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-14 09:21:55'] For people who dont get it, they just want to product reviewers to say words to the effect of their product being "GOOD VALUE", if the reviewers knew the true price, they would say it was a complete ripoff and that buyers are being price gouged etc. So these companies are allegedly extremely dishonest regarding the MSRP in order to receive favorable coverage.

During times of great demand, retailers sell above MSRP.Supply and demand. If you don't know anything about supply and demand, don't invest.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-19 16:35:27'] The title is sensationalist, but beyond that I think these are valid concerns that shouldn't be dismissed. The proof of work model for crypto isn't sustainable long term and is being replaced by better solutions. Crypto is fascinating and disruptive, but there's no reason to believe that GPU mining is mandatory for a crypto future. On the gaming side of things, every major GPU manufacturer will be competing for TSMC supply. Intel is prepared to hurt their own margins in order to make pricing competitive. This can eat into Nvidia's margins and impact future earnings. RDNA 3 will be competitive with Lovelace in performance. We'll see how Alchemist turns out, but there's no reason why Intel can't be competitive in the GPU space if they're properly managed.Look at what happened to growth companies that missed their lofty growth targets just recently. That could definitely happen to Nvidia. This could present a great buying opportunity since Nvidia is a great company, but people should be aware that a drop is very possible.

This way they will quickly make modifications on upcoming models and release new models very quickly. Even apple M1 chip also same. This approach can be success only if they control the market which NVDA has.It is easy that NVDA can kill intel cpu than Intel kill NVDA gpu as GPUs are more powerful than CPU.NVDA chips are using all most all of tech company data centers and government institutions. They have long term contracts. Tsla and Mercedes-auto drive use NVDA chips. NVDA also owing quantum computers. It is feature proof. As Jim mentioned, May be NVDA is fist $10T company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 13:28:57'] Debt resolution has the end to loan repayment postponement baked in. That means less money circulating and slower growth in the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:21:46'] Look at Germany who just officially called their recession.England next then the US come this fall.Fed pivot always drops the economy and it‚Äôs probably coming by the end of summer.Thing is I personally believe this Inflation is persistent so I‚Äôm expecting to see fed pivot, economy fall from under itself and relatively heavy job losses, slight interest cut, fed says we are officially in recession, some more cuts, inflation goes back up because this thing is clearly in no hurry to go away and people will still spend frivolously (which the federal reserve clearly wants that to stop) therefore raising interest rates again by mid 2024.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 06:20:32'] I think its clear from the bank issues that the rate hike effects are lagging to some degree so the current level may be enough to stop inflation in the short term, but obviously not long term which need dramatic fiscal changes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 05:16:04'] I believe the Fed will keep raising rates or decide to let inflation continue. I'm very doubtful the Fed will cut rates any time soon unless we have a major black swan event that forces the economy into a recession.Currently there is no sign of a recession: Unemployment is low, Consumers [at least those who have money] are still spending, consumers are still borrowing, and houses are still selling even though mortgage rates have almost doubled. There are some winners and losers in the K-shaped curve, but for the macroeconomy there seems to be no sign of recession big enough to get the Fed to cut rates.If the government continues more deficit spending, there maybe a crowding out in the bond market, where the government will be selling more bonds causing the price of bonds to decline and rates to increase. This may put more pressure on the Fed to increase rates and certainly not cut rates.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 12:56:02'] Don‚Äôt think too hard. If you own $1000 worth of a stocks before split, it will still be $1000 after split.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 19:45:26'] Here is a Copy and Paste from a Principles of Accounting Course that I believe should put your worries to rest:*Although shareholders will perceive very little difference between a stock dividend and stock split, the accounting for stock dividends is unique. Stock dividends require journal entries. Stock dividends are recorded by moving amounts from retained earnings to paid-in capital. The amount to move depends on the size of the distribution. A small stock dividend (generally less than 20-25% of the existing shares outstanding) is accounted for at market price on the date of declaration. A large stock dividend (generally over the 20-25% range) is accounted for at par value.*

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 18:33:26'] I actually have the same question as the OP, but with TTD which recently split. The date of record was June 9 and it begins trading at the split adjusted price this week (maybe tomorrow). But‚Ä¶what if I bought shares *after* the record date but *before* the split adjusted date? The pre split price was ~$600. Did I just buy a single share for $600 that won‚Äôt split since I bought it after the record date? Of course, I didn‚Äôt do that. But I have the same question.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 18:46:33'] Do you guys think the price will increase after the split? Like Tesla or Apple last year?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 22:41:03'] Scenario 1: What TDA told you is true. This is how splits work. 6/21 is a typo/error. I‚Äôve seen other articles publish a 7/21 date, which is also lunacy.Scenario 2: Market forgot to adjust the price on 6/22 to account for the split shares the 6/21 holders will get on 7/20. IMPOSSIBLE. Markets are efficient.Holding 100 shares since 6/18.Edit: the 6/21 date might be the x div for the normal dividend and not the split. Clarified above.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-24 09:04:29'] The language is confusing. As it reads, it does sound like you will not receive extra shares. I've been through a few splits over the years and it always works itself out so worry. I'm wondering if this means that people who buy now will receive cash and not the extra stock. So if you buy NVDA now for $700 your 1 share will be worth $175, but then you will receive the difference in cash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-25 09:09:24'] Here's what I've read on Motley about this:"What's missing from NVIDIA's press release is the ex-dividend date. Because the stock split is being initiated in the form of a stock dividend, the ex-dividend date governs which investors are eligible to receive the newly split shares. In this case, NVIDIA's stock split goes ex-dividend on July 19, according to a spokesperson for brokerage house Charles Schwab.This means that investors can buy NVIDIA shares right up to July 19, and still be eligible to receive the additional shares from the stock split once the shares begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens July 20." This coincides with what TD Ameritrade told you. You're fine to buy and get the split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 12:23:53'] Buy and HODL?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 14:09:47'] You got it somewhat right.  June 21 is the ex-split date.  But it doesn't split until july...but guess what's going to happen June 22?  The stock is gonna drop by 75% (or whatever) to reflect the new value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 18:18:04'] COB on the 21st of June the stock will split (you need to be the owner on or before this date). On July 19, the share holder will receive the three additional shares (if you own shares prior to the split). Then on 20 July, you'll be able to trade the shares with the split-adjusted price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 06:36:40'] Disagree. On the compute side, no one is using intel based processors for ML workloads. AMD is cheaper, and far cheaper still are ASICs, ARM-based processors, and so much of the ML community relies on cuda through NVIDIA GPUs. On the manufacturing side, intel fabs are several lithography generations behind TSMC. Intel itself uses TSMC for the latest generation processors because their fabs are behind. Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven‚Äôt seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques. What intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 07:29:14'] It is really hard for Intel to compete with TSMC.  Simply because "everything" is much cheaper to make in asia.  Even TSMC says it'll cost them much more to build chips in the USA than their factory in Taiwan.  Another example is Tesla cars are much cheaper to make in their shanghai factory than their USA factory.  It also puzzled my mind when people says Tesla have such good manufacturing ability when Chinese are building cars at a fraction of the price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 12:53:35'] The fact that the government wants to use your tax money to invest in Intel should tell you how bad of an investment this is. Just look at GM.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 03:42:44'] In my opinion auto dealers in general are overvalued everyone is basing their valuation from the pandemic days where people were forced to buy over MSRP and dealers weren‚Äôt incentivized to give out deals. Analysts that believe in these companies are hoping that consumers will continually overpay for their cars and that manufacturer incentives won‚Äôt come back so that dealers can maintain margins. When you have people underwater on their overpriced car it‚Äôs going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand. Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They‚Äôre now down -16% from that earning report. There‚Äôs still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP.

The market can hardly be called a bubble right now, and despite what people may think the Fed has actually done a very good job of deflating the balloon. I cant really bring myself to blame them for SVB folding the way it did, that comes down to the company themselves, though it is all part of the pain of sorting out the mess.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 16:23:30'] That is a crazy amount of authorized shares increased even if they aren't planning on using it. The ARM deal is nowhere as expensive as 120 billion??I don't think the market will like this action at all
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 17:00:40'] What's the difference between a stock split and share dilution?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 19:54:38'] Dilution? Damn, was hoping they would opt to go for a stock split instead..
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 22:17:09'] What's the chance that they can actually successfully acquire ARM?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 00:48:20'] All these people on the board own a ton of shares. Just because they'll be authorised doesn't mean they'll all at once issue a massive flood of stocks. It would hurt their own pocket. If they wanna acquire a new company they'd either have to take on a ton of debt, which would "devalue" your shares. Or issue new shares to buy, which would "devalue" your shares the same amount but without the debt burden of interest and such... (which one would you prefer?)BUT it doesn't actually devalue your shares, does it? You take on new debt or issue more shares, you end up with more cash as a result. You end up with a smaller slice of the pie, but it's now a bigger pie. So where do you lose?Whatever they buy will add value to your shares.Disclaimer: Very, very simplified view but hopefully it'll stop people freaking out about this. Happens all the time, which is why (trusting) management of a company is so important.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 16:43:15'] Nice to see that there's a flash sale soon.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 19:33:16'] So I should take my gains in the morning and buy the dip I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 01:19:46'] Do we trust Nvidia‚Äôs management to use these shares appropriately? I trust Jensen to lead the company, but why do they need to do this?With currently 2 billion shares authorised for issuance against 619M shares outstanding, we already have a possible dilution of your 1 share being worth 0.236 shares. If they‚Äôre authorised to issue another 2 billion shares, then that brings us down to 0.134x worth the value before issuance. This is an extra ~56% reduction in our share of equity on top of the possible ~76% reduction we already have.To see how this is even remotely something worth voting for, in my view, Nvidia would have to increase operating earnings/FCF by at least the same multiplier at which they dilute our shares. Simultaneously I would also like to see them maintain their high return on equity, be able to retain a larger portion of their earnings and if not return that portion in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts. Hopefully if shares are used for mergers, that management can recognise when our shares are overvalued and the business to be acquired undervalued, then mergers will be of great value for us.Taking such a possible dilution cuts your portion of wealth and ownership significantly and I, and I think many of you also, would like to see a great return for it.If the extra shares weren‚Äôt included for use in executive and employee compensation I would feel a lot better about this proposal. The option of lining their own pockets at the expense of your investment still exists.

POST_TEXT: b'I remember looking at Nvidia stock price a year or two back, when everyone was rightfully saying it is a strong buy due to AI and autonomous vehicles. I was thinking into adding it to my portfolio but after this dip, I want to ask Nvidia holders- Do you think now it is a good time to buy especially right before the stock split ? Or should wait a little bit more to see if they drop a little more ? Also does anyone have opinions on AMD ?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 04:26:58'] I will always hold and buy the dips on NVIDIA for a long term position, I look for it to grow well beyond my retirement (10 more years) if all goes well.  Personally I will be picking more up this week ASAP following the split.  The AI, deep machine learning and automated vehicles are going to be a huge driver for NVIDIA.  TSLA revealed their super computer used for their AV machine learning and it is built using NVIDIA GPUs.https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/22/tesla-av-training-supercomputer-nvidia-a100-gpus/Edit:  Regarding AMD.  Have held it as well for 3 years and it‚Äôs been frustrating in that period of time BUT, with the chip shortage, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before it goes for a nice run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 05:23:29'] Dont call that a dip already
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 07:17:19'] I thought it would pull back after the split but it looks like this is the pullback. It may dip a little more but I wouldn't hesitate to buy some at this price. They are crushing it and price targets have been raised to 900 and 1000. Plenty of room to run. Also, if the ARM merger goes through it could easily be back up to 4 or 500.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 05:04:22'] I own both AMD and NVDA. I‚Äôve been picking up AMD recently, will look to add more NVDA if it keeps falling. NVDA is awesome but the valuation is pretty absurd.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 04:26:24'] Has anything fundamentally changed about NVDA and it‚Äôs opportunity to thrive in our future? If not, buy and hold. AMD is not apples to apples with NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 06:25:47'] I believe it still has to come down and test 650. This could happen before the stock split and it run up after the stock split or happen just after the stock split and it need to go down to 182 or so post split before booming up. I do think it could get there this week
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 07:18:31'] As a shareholder I try and buy into the stock regularly. However if you look at the chart you will notice that every time the stock has hit an all-time high over the last year it‚Äôs dropped 15-20% before resuming an up-trend and reaching new ATH. It may pay to wait, but you also might watch it go to $900 over the next month. Timing the market is not easy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 00:37:48'] NVDA is a strong buy in any dip.But this isn‚Äôt a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 14:15:07'] Where will NVDA be 5 years from now? I say over $250 a share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 04:10:00'] Don't think I'd take a position until after the stock splits...
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 05:22:33'] Bitcoin miners bought just about every available NVIDIA GPUs.  The recent bitcoin crack down in China significantly reduces the demand for GPU in SE Asia (and a decent secondhand market).I think NVIDIA has more room to drop.  Their market is too lucrative for other to not join in.  It was not too long ago that I bought a bunch of NVIDIA for $380-$420, nothing really change since then.  The current run-up is mostly about ARM and stock split news.  While we may not see that sub $500 level again.  Low-mid 600 is not unreasonable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 04:03:50'] Nvidia has had a huge run up this year.  I would go long AMD now instead of Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 23:08:29'] I would let the dust settle from the split at least.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-18 07:56:18'] Just buy SMH. I like NVDA, but the price was a bit too high for my taste. So I bought SMH instead. Has broad exposure to all aspects of the sector and includes other companies, like TSM and ASML. But, owning both NVDA and AMD will be solid for the coming years. Both are making moves to firm up positions in the automotive space which will be a hugh driver of growth for both companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:38:02'] First in, first out so you would be correct.  As for wash, just don‚Äôt buy back for 30 days to avoid but I‚Äôm unsure how it would affect your long term gains if you did.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 18:19:06'] Even before you sell, the gains page should show whats long term and whats short term
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 19:06:11'] You are correct assuming that the date you bought the 10 shares in January of 3023 is more than one year from the date you sold them in January 2024 (also assuming we‚Äôre talking US tax law). If you bought them 1/31/23 and sold them 1/3/24 then the gain or loss on those 10 shares would be short term gain/loss.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:21:31'] Each lot of shares has it's own time period. So yes, the first 10 shares would be long-term since they're just one big lot, and then all the other shares would be short term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:56:32'] You might want to go to your brokerage settings and make sure you have FIFO set for selling. This way the original shared will be sold first and not the new ones. That will help provide you the opportunity to achieve the long term capital gains tax rate on everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 03:19:33'] Not just the month, the date is important. If u bought 10 Jan 2023 and sold 8 Jan 2024, it‚Äôs less than 1 year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 06:17:21'] Most brokerages should have options like first in first out (FIFO) or first in last out. Most default to first in first out, meaning the first shares you bought will be the first shares you sell. After one year of holding shares they will be considered long term and be taxed as such. You don‚Äôt have wait 30 days to sell shares you just bought you can sell them immediately, even if your account doesn‚Äôt qualify for day trading. You‚Äôre allowed 3 trades every 5 days even if your account doesn‚Äôt meet the rules for day trading. If your 30 days comment was about wash sales then yes you have to wait 30 days to rebuy the stock to avoid wash sale rules.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:26:34'] 1. Yes that is exactly how that works. Your 10 stocks would have been turned into a long term stock position and your remaining 12 would still be short term.2. Except since you sold in January 2024 wouldn't that apply to your 2025 tax filing?

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 07:40:36'] thank you for sharing your thoughts,but it's just as good as saying amazon, apple, microsoft are good long term. Everyone knows that already, so just a nice 3sec confirmation bias and that's it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 07:58:27'] Obviously there is strong growth potential, especially as GPU demand skyrockets.I would bucket this with TSMC, there is growth potential but the market is currently correcting tech downwards.Would buy when the red carnage stops.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 12:14:51'] NVDA has been one of my best positions - got in at 200 years ago.  Had to ride out the bitcoin mining crash, but it eventually roared back.Also don't forget they make an autonomous self driving car platform for car companies to use.  They have been amazing in leveraging their GPU tech into so many different revenue streams.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 12:50:57'] Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.I have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).Anyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a "niche" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).To summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic "value".And just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see "Security Analysis" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.The $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.FWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.P.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though).

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 11:10:55'] Way over priced especially considering the massive Silicon Shortage.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 10:34:41'] Love this one for the semiconductor play.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 12:35:37'] Personally, I think you are grossly optimistic on the ARM deal. The UK is very likely to block this, and China very well could as well out of spite from Trump's tariffs and from blacklisting Huaweii.It is far from likely, and I would say far more unlikely that it is likely.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 12:45:14'] NVDA for sure has a high ceiling but I like SMH better for the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 13:41:59'] Demand for mining rigs will probably scale with cryptos growth as well right. Could be another point to be bullish
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 14:01:24'] I like NVDA and I'd like to add more before the price goes up. I own more Softbank than NVDA and honestly I thought NVDA got a really good deal on ARM, felt like it's worth more than what they agreed to. There's one element to the deal that's sort of gotten swept under the rug which is that there's a semi-autonomous Chinese sales office, which had full access to the intellectual property, that went rogue last year. The office in London tried to fire the guy in charge and he just refused and kept running it. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/softbank-owned-chipmaker-arm-says-it-replaced-china-ceo-allen-wuIt might have just been sorted in a low profile way and I missed it. But having a subsidiary with all the intellectual property, half owned by China, in this position is unsettling.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 16:23:42'] Great analysis. Definitely agree its hinging on the ARM deal. Its already priced in that they will dominate long-term, especially off of data centers. But if ARM goes through, it should hopefully surge to new highs right away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 16:41:55'] I really like the company and am excited for the ARM acquisition if approved, but I have a gut feeling that the valuation is out of whack. If ARM goes through I can see it holding is current price, but if not I think we will see a loss if buying at the current price. I of course could be very wrong, but it seems like buying now is buying at the top.That being said, anything in semiconductors is a good long term. I just bought 4 MU today since they recently announced a restructuring of R&D strategy

It‚Äôs a totally reasonable amount of money just to experiment with! See what happens. If it was 300K that‚Äôs another story but you can learn a lot watching the volatility (or downright losses) a few individual stocks might incur. Teaches you for when you have more to invest.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:19:03'] Buy another ETF dump the individual stocks and stop using a shotgun approach to stock picking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:32:39'] This is a genuine piece of sincere advice - if you are not confident in your individual stock picks that you have to go on Reddit to ask for reassurance - dump them all and go into an index fund.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:43:13'] I like stock picking too, it's a fun hobby. However it's hard, and can be an expensive hobby if you're wrong. I really highly recommend keeping around 80% invested in ETFs, finding a way to auto invest a little bit every paycheck, and not worrying too much.If you really have a few stocks you like and want to do more stock picking do it with a smaller %. Have your fun, have some upside if you're, and limit your downside if you're wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:26:49'] A bit all over the place, suggest putting 75% into an ETF port and 15% individual picks 10% cash. Try and organise them separately if you can with your broker.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:38:16'] 46% is in US index ETFs (VOO, VTI and QQQ are almost identical but I don't mind the "diversification" in management and a little bit of mid small cap).I'm not gonna judge the individual stocks. We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think "gambling" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.If you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.I think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:57:30'] While the US is great for investing I would diversify a lot more into Europe and Asia

You know in 2023 companies like Apple, Tesla, meta, and nvidia have average gains of around 50% while the S&P is up around 15%. I think we are indeed in a world where the winners take most and you made a good decision with nvidia, Tesla, and Google.

POST_TEXT: b'What do you think about the current stock valuation of NVDA? Assuming that they cant close the deal with ARM. \n\nThe P/E ratio is quite high.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:10:26'] That's an incredibly high cost basis.They announced a new CPU for servers. So that's priced in. I am not sure whether market has priced in the ARM deal falling out. For the stock to go higher, they would have to blowout the earnings completely and the expectations are already very high.My personal opinion is, it's a bit frothy right now.It moved to $460 just on fears of rising interest rates. So the downside might be substantial if some bad news breaks. If you are willing to hold 3-4 years it would recover but not sure about short term upside..
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 20:03:54'] I'd say it's pretty overvalued. But if I had it already I'd probably hold it and think about a near-term exit, maybe in the next few months. It could keep going up in the short term in this market but it's all speculation at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 03:22:17'] AMD is the way better play imo - they took market share from Intel in the server business most likely (see Intel earnings yesterday) and are selling every SKU they have just as quickly as Nvidiaalso, nvidia will not have a cpu before 2023 iirc
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:07:51'] Tipranks Earnings SmartScore has NVDA at a 10/10.  So that's nothing to sneeze at.  I can personally attest that it's basically impossible to pick up one of their cards... they sell as soon as they hit the market, and have been for months.  I can't imagine how they won't kill on their earnings call with good expectations on the next quarter as they attempt to meet demand.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 20:30:50'] my only concern is recent rize of AMD and their Radeon graphics card. if team red somehow manages to outperform Nvidia, that could be bad for them
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:32:53'] If u own the stock hold, but if you don't have it I think u may have missed the chance. 530 good entry price level and it dipped as much as 480 recently, that would've been rly nice
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 21:11:40'] You can‚Äôt just look at their price, the closest competitors nor their past record.Look at them compared to the market, especially the print up demand for their products.  Look at the overall index fund for comparison against other investment opportunities.  Look at their price vs themselves in 2-5 years.They are priced well at $500, appropriately at $600 and overvalued at $650 and higher.  The market is swimming in liquidity currently and there is a shortage hurting them and their competitors.  Demand is pent up especially for those who would mine bitcoins.Sorry, just on a mobile so can‚Äôt link any more specifics but wouldn‚Äôt buy at the current price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:58:07'] Hold and buy nvidea.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 01:46:02'] I can‚Äôt figure out how much their 97% market share in deep learning will translate to revenue. Does anyone have any idea?Their chips are pretty much critical for all deep learning, and other up-and-coming tech such as AR/VR, gaming, etc. Not to forget their data centers, development of DPUs, and potential ARM deal. NVDA could be the ultimate pick&shovel play of the next decade.If the ARM deal goes through, I think NVDA is a $1T company easily. But for now I‚Äôm just on the sidelines because I can‚Äôt figure out an evaluation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 07:51:12'] For the life of me, I cannot say why anyone would value them that high, that is > $600 when you have an ongoing chip shortage that has and will continue to impact their and their partners' ability to deliver significant qty's of graphics cards, professional cards and their chips on partner boards. Automakers are halting production everywhere because some silly bit of Silicon can't be shipped. So imagine how it is for Nvidia who's products are bascially 80% Silcon. You cannot legitly buy a moderately priced RTX card. That market is as overheated right now as most tech stocks are.P/E north of 75 (it stands way over 80 right now @ $604, even for a "high growth" company, is suspicious to me. This level of P/E for a company the size of Nvidia? Not sure people who think that's OK have the same way of looking at valuations. It's OK if the company doesn't have sizable sales or is carrying lots of debt for accelerating their business. Yes, I know they are the magical unicorn, AI, Ray Tracing, Deep Learning and all that buzz - they got it all! But frankly... how much of that current price is hoping that the value they might generate with that catches up?I am pretty sure the conviction on price will get turned around on just a bit of bad news. And when you hear about it you can be sure you'll be running for the exit the same as all the others.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:18:37'] I think it's going straight to 1t market cap
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:55:43'] Smh etf
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 20:15:14'] Their forward pe is 39. So if they trade sideways for a year (I believe they should) and hit the growth expectations they will be trading at a more reasonable 39. For comparison AMD has a 31 forward pe.  I was lucky enough to add to my position at 470 about a month ago, but I‚Äôm planning on waiting for a more reasonable fundamental buy point to add more. I believe everyone should have some exposure to them as a hold forever stock. So in that respect you can afford to overpay a little for them, but if you already have some exposure I‚Äôd put it in a slightly better priced company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 04:36:20'] I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction this year. But as you know, NVIDIA is a very strong company, so I think a correction is more likely because of money flowing out of the whole tech sector, or whole market, than anything NVIDIA specific (although high P/E growth stocks get hit harder in such times). But you could wait until after earnings 27 May for a clearer picture.Ultimately, nobody has the answer you're looking for. Corrections are inevitable. Buy companies you believe in, diversify and DCA. You will win in the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 08:46:54'] Imo, Nvidia is a great pick, but look at the semiconductor market; there are shortages that will last for 1-3 years. So Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. will have lower sales than expected due to this shortage for a while. Based on the massive performance uplift in Nvidia's new 3XXX GPUs, I am bullish on them. Nvidia has continued to be the company for GPUs for consumers. OEMs and system integrators are scared of AMD for some reason, which helps Nvidia's (& Intel's) sales. Some bearish stuff would be Apple and AMD. AMD has almost caught up with Nvidia in the last 3 years, which means that AMD will be taking market share away in the GPU market. Apple's M1 chips are the best in the market for power efficiency and relative performance, so I'd expect Apple to gain market share through their hardware. I'm holding Nvidia, AMD, and Apple at fairly even amounts, mostly because I'm bullish on those consumer semiconductor manufacturers as a whole rather than 1 individual stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-24 19:31:16'] NVDA has been one of my favorite stocks. I've always liked this stock. I'm convinced that they're able  to stay a few steps ahead of the competition, which has greatly increased. I haven't paid much attention to it's valuation, which eventually might cause me to lose money. I still like the stock, and don't expect to change my perception of Nvidia (at least not in the near future).
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 19:44:23'] Over valued. I would seriously wait until we have another market crash before I bought this. Like i‚Äôd wait years if that‚Äôs what it took.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 21:18:54'] Short term - OverLong term - very undervalued
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 02:14:13'] They're incredibly expensive, but they also have a practical monopoly on AI training. It's not really even their products, AMD, Google, Tesla, Amazon do have somewhat comparable products and AMD might beat them in price/performance for gaming. None of that really matters due to the sheer market dominance Nvidia has.People aren't really content with Nvidia having such dominance though, many don't like their prices and I think that is driving a lot of new competitors, but so far everyone has failed trying to compete with Nvidia. 8 out of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world use Nvidia, 70% of new supercomputers use Nvidia, remember that GPU acceleration is only a subsection of supercomputers, some workloads only use CPU and Nvidia isn't even in that space, still they got 70% overall market share in supercomputers. These people are the ones who place one order for 10,000 GPUs for $15k a pop, just for one project or application.[https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/)That's like 3% of their quarterly revenue done in one order, there's a lot of business potential with AI popping up everywhere. OpenAI I think is making bank with GPT-3 and you got self driving starting to become really popular, companies and institutions are dying to order these 10,000 GPU systems from Nvidia.Nvidia's gross margins are really ridiculous at +65%, and 41% operating margin is also crazy, their growth is crazy. In data center they grew 97%, over 5 years they're average growth in data center has been 82%, their revenue growth overall grew 61% Y/Y.With the silicon shortage I think people have started to accept the higher prices for GPUs as well. On the silicon side, investment keeps increasing and there's a great roadmap for the next 5 years, generation performance increase will remain strong. Nvidia is spending $4 billion on R&D, 23% of net revenue which is another great long term sign, they really keep making great products. They got their co-founder as CEO Jensen Huang, and he's got a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford.Their stock price really is outrageous, but if there's one company who deserves it, it's Nvidia because they're doing everything right. I sold out of them when the arm deal seemed to stall out, but I think it's probably time to back in because people seem to have gotten over that.

POST_TEXT: b"I noticed both NVDA and AMD are doing quite well lately, despite both being in the same sector. I've been invested in both of them for quite some time, foreseeing a future where they both butt heads and compete while also pushing each other to work harder and advance faster.\n\nAnyone have similar outlooks? So far it seems like it is and will come to fruition. Is there room for both of them to continue to grow? Do you think such growth and accomplishments is related to competition, or it's just a coincidence? Do you have more eggs in one competitors' basket than the others?\n\nPersonally I still like NVDA more, but I can definitely see them both excelling in different areas of the same industry."
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 10:53:00'] Its funny you ask that about NVDA and AMD but the most obvious example of a corporation stagnating due to market monopoly is Intel.  The reason why Intel is so far behind TSMC was that they owned the entire PC/Datacenter market for almost 15 years and didn't need to compete or innovate to print money.  Healthy competition is good for the entire industry. Having said that NVDA pretty much owns the entire GPU market and can't grow faster than the TAM.  AMD on the other hand can grow faster than TAM by taking share from NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 10:45:55'] NVDA is instrumental in AI and the next decade of growth is all about AI.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 13:16:42'] No, it's not.You can find examples of sectors that did awful because the sector got too hot, and there was too much competition for anyone to make money. Peter Lynch talks about this in his books, it's why he often avoids investing in "hot" sectors.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 10:47:29'] Competition is good news for efficiency and profits. Ask Rockefeller.

I own several like that such as DKNG, SE, and MELI. I think the sentiment has since changed around MELI. SE and DKNG still have negative sentiments from 2021. Do you just buy and do research in silence or do you mention you bought them or their earnings reports on r/stocks?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 09:04:46'] It always blows my mind how people buy right after earnings. For example, ABT is currently up 8% on an earnings beat. Who sees a stock go up 8% in one day and thinks "yeah, I think now's the time I'll buy." Bruh, the idea is to buy BEFORE it skyrockets, not after. Although, I guess NVDA buyers are proving me wrong every day.Edit: FOMOers pretty mad right now. There's almost always a pullback. This is called chasing, and it is irrational. When you buy after a stock has already skyrocketed, you're buying into momentum, which won't last long. ABT will likely correct soon, just like any other stock that jumps disproportionately to its earnings beat. I can't say when or by how much, but all else equal and it'll happen. DCAing always wins; loading up during a momentum-based run is just stupid

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 12:42:59'] Arhaus (ARHS) is an interesting stock. A high-end furniture retailer with 72 stores currently. They listed in 2021 and are down ~34% from IPO. They've had consistently growing earnings since IPO but recently tanked on slowing EPS growth. Things I find interesting are that ~50% of their customers make more than $200k per year. On the one hand this might insulate them from a downturn as wealthier people tend to be less affected, but on the other hand they will likely still cut back on discretionary spending. They currently have a PE of ~8 and a future PE of ~9.Downsides are a lot of debt, looks like ~$700M. They had a ton of growth in 2022 which has slowed, might be a one hit wonder and unable to keep up the growth. They only IPOd in 2021 which to me usually means not enough of a track record to judge.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:26:19'] I wanted to share my story about my stock experience. I started trading stocks 2 years at the peak in 2021 and invested 2K. Most of my trading knowledge was self-taught although my friend shared all he knew about stocks with me as well. I opened an account with Webull in 2021 and immediately started investing in companies without much due diligence. I often went with trends and popular picks at the time. This certainly helped me with meme stocks like blackberry and SLGG at the time in which I made a profit but ultimately I made a lot of mistakes. By 2023 my account value was worth 1.1k and I ultimately did take the loss because I ended up needing to sell my losses bc I had never placed a stop loss or take profit order. Basically I quit stocks all together in 2022 but one thing I always knew was that I always seemed to find the hidden gem companies pretty often but never had the capital to invest bc I was in school with no disposable income. During the recent banking crisis I bought several stocks and I am happy to say that I have once again found my love for trading and I am more motivated than ever to build back my losses and get my account back to 2K or more. For instance, today my limit order to sell WAL will likely occur because the stock shot up to 39 in pre and could go further. I bought several shares at 23$ so feels good to know that buying on the dip returned me a huge profit!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:58:46'] The "Smart" "Sophisticated" and "Neutral" view of the economy apparently looks like this:No Landing | Soft Landing | Hard Landing10% | 80% | 10%This is a view where the "overvalued" S&P500 tanks this year but small caps and individual companies can shine.Here's what bears think:No Landing | Soft Landing | Hard Landing10% | 10% | 80%However, both are extremely misguided.  An actual neutral view is more like:45% | 10% | 45%Monetary policy is an extremely dangerous and blunt tool if not used cautiously.  It just doesn't work with the precision that people are hoping for.  That's the job of Congress to carry the remaining load.**Unemployment does not increase linearly it's not going to increase exactly 0.5% as the consensus states, once it goes up 50bps it tends to increase 150bps or 200bps.**  That's just human momentum and inertia at play and there's tons of data to support this.And that's why I am bullish.  I don't even think unemployment TOUCHES 4%.  Because Fed knows Congress is incompetent, they're the only adults in the room and stability of the entire system (and perhaps even global economy) is in their hands. I believe Fed will move very cautiously and my forecast looks like this:80% | 10% | 10%The small cap Ra Ra crowd DOES NOT want me to be wrong, trust me.  In fact, small cap gets obliterated if Fed makes a policy error and overtightens.  They tend to drawdown even more aggressively vs. wider market and have even greater chance of having solvency issues.  Especially the low PE ones.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 14:49:47'] - Oil hitting year to date highs today as dollar weakens. WH claims it wishes to start SPR refills in H2 of this year (which is risky because that's precisely when the oil market is projected to tighten). Meanwhile Congressionally mandated SPR sales will continue for a  few more months. My prediction: they're not going to do it in time. Oil market is going up.- Meanwhile Europe appears to be lagging on signing longer-term LNG contracts. They got lucky this winter, but not signing long-term contracts is risky. Qatar and US (and other) exporters require long-term contracts, especially since they need financing to build the infrastructure / expand production. This hesitancy means they will have to buy natural gas on the spot market (= immediate delivery). If prices tighten by next winter, which they will thanks to Asian demand and limited US export capacity, this will hit Europe's finances. The smart move would be to lock in prices now before they spike again. Germany just shut down one of their nuclear plants. What do you think they will use inste--coal. It's coal. Just last year they tore up a village to build a lignite mine. [Here are German police keeping protestors away from the giant wheel tearing up the dirt](https://i.imgur.com/pX3vGIU.png).- China is warning of power shortages in the summer. This happened in previous summers when their hydropower capacity was hit hard by heatwaves. It forced industrial shutdowns, where at times all factories were closed for days. And that was with Covid lockdowns intermittent. An example of coal demand in China [pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/YanQinyq/status/1645827635866370054): "In the past seven months, Guangdong province has fast-tracked approval of 20.48 GW Coal-fired power plants (22 units), data from Shizhimedia news. The last time Guangdong approved a coal plant was in October 2019." China in 2022 approved the addition of on average 2 new coal plants a week (enough to power the entire UK).- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indias-power-output-grows-fastest-pace-33-years-fuelled-by-coal-2023-04-05/):  "India's power generation grew at the fastest pace in over three decades in the just-ended fiscal year, a Reuters analysis of government data showed, fuelling a sharp surge in emissions as output from both coal-fired and renewable plants hit records. Intense summer heatwaves, a colder-than-usual winter in northern India and an economic recovery led to a jump in electricity demand, forcing India to crank up output from coal plants and solar farms as it scrambled to avoid power cuts."How serious is India about energy?- "For the second year in a row, India‚Äôs government has ordered the nation‚Äôs coal-fired power plants to run at full power. But this year‚Äôs order is even more sweeping than last year‚Äôs ‚Äî all coal and oil-fired generators will be maxed out for the entire summer, from April through June." India and China (and other emerging markets) are hungry for energy, and they will add enormous quantities of both renewable and fossil fuel capacity to meet this demand. Unfortunately for the world, this means more thermal coal usage (my investment case is not an endorsement of carbon emissions and ultimately none of this is good). Thermal coal may be dying in the US, as more plants get phased out, but it's  not dying elsewhere. Even in green Europe, we know they will burn more coal due to an unwillingness to use LNG, renewables, or nuclear power in sufficient quantity. None of this implies a slow in growth for renewables, to emphasize. All countries are investing massive amounts of money into solar/wind/EVs. This will tighten the copper market dramatically as China reaccelerates its industrial/construction activity. It also means more steel demand (which means tighter met coal markets).What does this imply? Tighter crude oil + LNG + thermal coal markets. Copper prices will rise as will met coal for renewables + industrial activity.Long BTU, AMR, FCX, XOM, PSCE ...

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 15:20:53'] Ok so, I don't quite know what conclusion to draw here.Unemployment is still low 3,5-3,6%.CPI is inconsistently going down on a MoM basis.Core however seems very sticky, It's dropping but really slowly MoM.Every months that rates are high is a month that the economy struggles a bit more it's a month that earnings are hurt and that the job market is tested so we are like on a timer here before the soft landing isn't an option anymore.I don't think earnings are gonna be that good too. Is a rising unemployment number deflationary?If I had to guess, gun to my head I'd say... Slightly, cautiously...

I'm one of the most bearish people here, and probably think the lowest of the fed of most people here, but even I cant see the fed being so fucking stupid as to hike when they are forecasting a recession within 6 months.Obviously they know shit behind the scenes is bad (credit tightening, bank lending dropping dramatically, etc), but the fed NEVER says things like "a recession is coming" and they always try to calm everyone. Shit is probably worse than 99% of people here think. Think about it, the fed just said they are expecting a recession soon. The same fed that ALWAYS underexagerates everything...Yikes

Looking under the surface, if we use the equal-weight S&P as a proxy for the valuation of the average stock, and not cap-weighted towards mega-caps and outliers like Tesla, Amazon or Nvidia, equal weighted valuation is only 14.1 P/E, which is dare I say actually somewhat undervalued and attractive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 06:29:20'] I believe $ALLY bank is being unfairly punished with other smaller banks even though I believe they can prosper without the Fed cutting rates.* As an online only tech-focused bank, they don't have physical branches.  With superior expense structure they can offer very competitive rates while still maintaining above average NIM 3.72% way above industry.* Most banks make money by ripping off customers with 0.5% APY hoping they are too lazy or uneducated to notice.  Ally passes on expense savings to customers and fair returns instead.  As a result their deposits keep increasing.  Their deposits increased nearly $11B to $152B in 2022.  * All other banks are struggling with shrinking deposit bases as rapidly rising rates exposes their business model flaws.  People are realizing they are scammed and moving to brokered CDs or money market funds.  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=12qaI* They have almost no duration risk since they focus on auto loans and it's all booked FV, marked to market.* Wide moat and brand.  96% customer retention.  Consistently awarded "best places to work", "companies that care" etc.  Raised their minimum wage to $23 and gives every single employee 100 shares of stock to make them owners.  Invests heavily in their employees.Bear case:It's important to understand risks though.  They are sensitive to a recession since a downturn means auto loans go bad.* Another strong bout of deflation in used cars can hurt their loan values ability to recover on defaulted loans.  This is a big driver of declining loan values in 2022 for them. However, there's evidence in wholesale cars that used cars will actually surge and CPI data is very lagging.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/03/21/used-car-prices-inflation-fed/11493470002/* Moreover they are extremely conservative with ALLL or allowance for loans and lease losses.  Provisions assume a dire 5% unemployment scenario by EOY 2023, way above other banks.  Very conservative provisions.* If you look at their expanded investor presentation for 4Q call, they spent way longer than usual talking about their credit profile to provide investors maximum transparency. https://s2.q4cdn.com/753234398/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/4Q'22-Ally-Earnings-Presentation.pdf  75% is prime credit rating and 90% of all consumer loans are collaterized.So it's not without risk but I believe they have good predictive analytics to give them an underwriting selection edge and stay on top of bad conditions as they come.

I won't get too into what the clouds or tea leaves look like to me, just that it seems less bipolar/can lead the traditional indices by 3 ish hours.So at the time of this post the gap between 1900 buttc performance and qqq reached what looked like a peak, and now qqq is heading towards where a scaled buttc performance might line up with. The 1900 buttc is seeing a higher high right now than the 830 pop, and more often than not that has been a decent hint that other indices could do the same before 4pm.Anyways, it's fun to watch.Edit: so far this idea is very wrong today.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive always wanted to get into NVDA but as someone with a small account I was never able to get in at a good price. Now with the price split it is cheaper. However I am seeing that NVDA is overvalued. Im not as familiar on AMD but I have heard from other people it is a good stock too. What do yall think I should do?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 13:37:40'] Personally, I think NVDA will always be #1 but owning both is never a bad thing. I'm more bullish on NVDA just due to how far they are into the AI sector while being on top for gaming hardware.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 12:48:00'] I bought NVDA as soon as I heard about the split.  But I also have some AMD, I‚Äôd say that either is a good pick
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 14:01:07'] AMD has a smaller market cap (110.8 B vs 488.3 B) so it has more potential for steep growth.Profit growth rate of AMD since 2018 is 212% while P/E ratio is 38 (growth rate is larger than P/E, showing it‚Äôs undervalued, but its growth rate is unsustainable long-term)For NVDA it‚Äôs 40% since 2017 with P/E ratio of 93 (growth rate isn‚Äôt caught up to P/E ratio, showing it‚Äôs overvalued)AMD has more explosive revenue and profit growth, but NVDA has significantly more cash assets and goodwillInsider trading reports (filed to SEC and are public records) show that AMD has significantly more stock purchases than NVDA within the company, showing higher confidence on AMD stock (buyers are legally required to hold stock for a certain amount of time, so high confidence would show here)I‚Äôm still doing research on the companies (mission, products, board of directors bios, and other external factors) but based on the balance sheets I‚Äôm leaning towards AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 16:46:43'] Ah the daily AMD vs NVDA conversation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 15:52:48'] AMD has definitely more room for growth. AMD GPUs are in PlayStation, Xbox, and Tesla cars, computer companies are starting to offer AMD CPUs more broadly, and soon it will dip into the auto space tech pool when it officially merges with XLNX.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 11:05:39'] I think amd is going to gain ground over the years. They are constantly adapting and improving tech as the underdog. On some of the tech channels I follow on YouTube a lot of gamers are switching to amd because of the steady improvement. Gaming continues to grow as the dominant population ages and is able to afford more products.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 11:25:53'] Popular question. I always answer AMD and I own both. It has a more attractive valuation(neither are cheap) and it‚Äôs growth prospects for the next few years look really good. I think NVDA has a bigger moat and has its hands in exciting areas, but a 90 P/E (give or take) is quite nuts
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 11:02:37'] There's a gaming ETF that includes both, ticker is ESPO
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 22:49:50'] This has nothing to do with either company's valuation, but I will say as a software developer. NVDA currently produces a much higher quality GPU by a large margin. Do with that information what you will.Also, not saying AMD produces bad products, because they don't. They're just not as good at the current time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-23 05:37:00'] NVDA is king but AMD is hot and up and coming. Every year AMD becomes much more competitive.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-23 05:48:05'] AMD since their APUs are in the new consoles and they cucked Intel hard with getting 7nm out first. Nvidia for their superior AI tech. Owning both doesn‚Äôt hurt but when it comes to growth AMD would be good since their chips are starting to be used more prominently than Intel‚Äôs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 11:04:14'] Amd has more upside but its recovered alot. They have a buyback but their entire production is outsourced which is a risk.I think their sp will be tied to market share which will be next seen at upcoming earnings. The merger is also another catalyst. But it was damn expensive. Nvda split makes it that much more attractive to holders
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 11:24:12'] NVDA is not overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-22 13:03:02'] Fractional shares, which many brokerages now offer, means you can buy stocks of any public company without buying an entire share. You never had to wait for a stock split. The last time NVIDIA was $190 before it reached an ATH of $206 was on June 25th. It isn't 'cheaper'.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-23 17:34:57'] Personally, the only thing I have over NVDA is that AMD announced that they‚Äôre buying back shares which raises the overall value of what you own. I own both just so you know.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 11:25:23'] It's too early to tell how Intel GPUs will perform. If they are on par with a 3070 ti and come in volume that will be a strong sell signal for Nvidia and AMD.AMD and Nvidia have been struggling to meet demand. If Intel can do that then they will likely bring GPU prices down significantly. AMD and Nvidia will likely need to cut prices to compete. That said, as an Intel investor I don't expect much from Intel's GPU. I would expect something on par with a 2070, which is significantly worse. And for it to be buggy. If it's stable and performs that will be a big surprise.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:25:04'] NVDA is a really bad example because that kind of percent gain is so rare after earnings. That said, yes, options are responsible for amplifying people‚Äôs NVDA gains. There‚Äôs no strategy to that, just luck based on their earnings report. You should fully understand everything about what options (like the greeks) are before you even begin to think of a strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:31:20'] I've been doing it daily for a year and a half and haven't done great.I read books, subscribed to websites, spent at least 200 hours trying to figure out the best strategy.If I could go back and do it all again, I would have paper traded for at least six months before I risked anything.People (like you) can buy calls and puts when they're new to options and have less experience.You have to be very experienced (depending on the trading platform) to sell calls and puts.So, you have people that are very experienced and know exactly what they're doing selling calls and puts to people that are inexperienced and don't really know what they're doing.It's like you're a freshman competing in any sport against seniors. Can you win, sure, will you win more than you lose, most probably not.Regardless, the first step is to pick a trading platform, deposit money, and then go through their tutorials on options trading. A lot of people on Reddit use Robinhood. I think Tasty Trade is the best available, but it's primarily for people that know what they're doing. Good luck and if you're trying to figure out what to do with a couple thousand dollars, you'd be better off buying a vending machine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 12:23:50'] i play it like over and under on stock prices, pretty much gambling by expiration + premium, only made like 17k today compare to the huge nvda gains https://i.imgur.com/ubLyjL0.png
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 13:02:29'] I sell safe options that I know will expire worthless but in my 2 years of doing it reinvesting my sales and using the dividends to reinvest as well I allmost have another 100 shares to start doubling I only do this with 1 stock atm I do like it tho I may try with some more but it‚Äôs really a gamble if it ever takes off I‚Äôm probably missing out on big profits

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:46:56'] Investopedia has a free stock simulator where they give you $100k and you can buy and sell options on it. Before you start with your own money I‚Äôd highly recommend doing this for a good 6 months first and at the end if you make gains then try it with small amounts of real money. You can lose thousands of dollars in the matter of minutes if you don‚Äôt trade professionally (from someone who has lost thousands from options trading).

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 16:16:44'] Jensen loosens his collar, the cloth scratching at his neck. Before him lies the Earnings call. Droves of Investors wait with bated breath for a briefest glimpse of hope in this dismal looking quarter. Intel is dying. Crypto sales are annihilated. Su Bae just won't quit. Jensen knows his legacy waits on the next few minutes. He hopes he can find the words to ease his whiplashers.Jensen clears his throat. Unmutes his mic. The silence is deafening."A.I."The cheers erupt almost instantaneously. Champagne is popped. Kisses fly between strangers. Nvidia is given a First class ticket to the moon from Biden himself.Jensen basks in the glory. He relishes the envious gazes of the Intel bagholders, so blinded by divvies that they can't see the future. But Jensen didn't care, because he could.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 17:11:24'] I sold at the bottom. Not near the bottom, at the bottom. I believed the PC market was set to crash and it has, but the stock is up 80%. What am I missing?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 21:37:38'] With the pump after hours the stock is still down over 35% from its all time high and yet its still incredibly overvalued. I remember arguing with u/apooroldinvestor back in November who was convinced this company would never go below $300.00 a share and I will say what I said then. This stock is the very definition of a bubble. The valuation is absolutely egregious no matter what metrics you use. The company is priced beyond perfection. The company is trading over a 500 BILLION DOLLARS! That is about the same size if you were to take all the biggest semi-conductors like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instrument‚Äôs, and Broadcom together and combined them! In what world does this make any sense to anybody? On top of trading at high multiples they had earnings declines which a company priced to over perfection should not exist period. This company has a lot more to fall before I even consider touching it. Right now the only thing moving this stock is pure speculation cause its for sure not the fundamentals that is moving it. This stock is completely disconnected from any fundamentals. Up over 50% in just 2 months. No thank you, staying away. I am leaving this to you u/apooroldinvestor and the other Nvidia fanboys.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 14:47:27'] I am fascinated by the reaction. A company that is valued at +120x Earnings, and +110x FCF reports +20% decline in revenue YoY, and weak guidence, and everyone celebrating?It is even worse when people spam the comments criticising any negative comment, and labeling it as a "positive sign." In nuthsell, they reported:* Revenue down 21%* Margin down 2pts* Expenses up 27%* Operating Income down 58%* Net Income, wait for it, down 53%* CFFO down 55%* YoY FCF, you guessed it, down 53%Numbers don't lie. I don't understand how anyone can skim through their earnings, and end up with, THIS IS GREAT. Even the positives with the data centers and auto revenue growth, it doesn't justify this. Companies that are valued at 120x shouldn't report negative growth. You like? Buy it. just don't justify non-sense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 15:40:47'] I've been holding NVDA since September 2016, I'm still holding and I will be holding for many more years. Imo many comments on here about NVDA are absolutely laughable. Like pointing out YoY growth decline when the quarter of comparison was at the peak of a product cycle + then the war and interest rates happened. As if the people actually moving a $500B company didnt know about PE or YoY numbers. NVDA is raking in the gains of years and years of work. They are the leading company in the largest revolution yet. This was the last quarter of a downcycle. The next quarters will speak for themselves.

The investors that own this stock are in it for the future profits. Short term traders and bears can make any argument they want about P/E ratio and valuation but the bottom line is that in this market you will want to be in stocks that have runways in front of them. If i were to pick one company to invest in for the next decade it would be NVDA. Ridin with Jensen

It is also rare-ish.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:42:23'] Just my opinion.    Most buyers buy short, there is black friday, sell their shares, take profits, buy what they want and come back the next month to buy more shares at a low price.

Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors bubble this week. \n\nFed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovi'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 10:45:49'] The funny part is that Powell and the Fed have been extremely consistent, saying the same thing over and over for the past few months.As the market rallied in 2023, every time Powell has a chance to speak he reiterates that the Fed will hike rates higher than the market thinks and will keep rates there longer than the market thinks. He continues to say this but the market continues to not believe him.It's comical to watch this play out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 09:28:34'] What J Powell actually said is that his inflation fighting is a failure. Yellen will need to invent a new term for after the transitory inflation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 08:03:59'] Watching the hearing right now, I think it's fair to say this hearing is barely concerning the business of the Fed. Senators are giving speeches about how the Biden administration is causing inflation, or that there are not enough Latinos in the fed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 13:28:01'] Are the markets now exclusively confined to J Powells actions?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 09:48:13'] > could spark a major tech sell-offWhat are the probabilities of the "could"?  Is it like 20% could? 50% could? Maybe 80% could?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 08:11:07'] > recent labor market strength warrants a ‚Äútighter stance of monetary policy.‚ÄùIt's legitimately a class war, isn't it? I thought the free market meant you let the invisible hand sort it out. If labor is in demand price elasticity will do it's thing and the most important labor will go to the most important use. This works for steel but not for labor? Blshit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 20:36:53'] Powell needs to be increasing 0.75%. these 0.25% increases are a waste, just draining everyone dry of money in a slow painful death. Rip off the damn bandaid already and let's get on with it. We are going to raise the debt ceiling again and guess what? More spending means higher inflation. We need to scale back spending and RAISE rates fast and furiously. End of story.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 09:56:57'] Its comical.  "shit is going too well, immediately blow up the economy" The funny thing is most big tech is swimming in cash and really doesn't need to tap the debt markets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 08:08:22'] Another way to say this is that certain sectors are still in a bubble despite recent selloffs

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 08:46:11'] J. Pow and the feed are clueless. It's not inflation it's corporate greed!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 08:00:07'] What non-market participants should rather worry about is if Powell doubled down on his dovish stance and reiterates his proclamation that disinflation had started since Feb 7, and will persist without any further raising of the fed funds rate beyond the token 25 bps of the last FOMC meeting.  Those in stocks, bonds and gold will be happy.  Those without any assets will descend into desperation as inflation continues to worsen (disinflation, remember, is inflation, at a slower pace).  Most likely, he will double down on disinflation to justify a smaller hike in the fed funds rate, because the market lobby has turned into a waterfall.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 14:37:31'] inflation really ramped up starting last March. You're gonna see a big fall YoY as the rise we will have in the coming months will be much lower than it was a year ago. I'm calling bluff on Powell. By May when inflation is much lower you'll see us right back to all being bullish.

The only notable thing about Facebook is that they declared war on staplers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 16:33:14'] The problem I have with the company is that they are fundamentally dependent on others. Apple and Tik Tok basically took them to the cleaners. Especially Apple, all they had to do was make a small change and the company shit the bed with no response to it. They basically had to rename the company and burn billions to create their own platform which looks like a bug failure. I wouldn‚Äôt invest in companies like this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 13:05:59'] Well a very nice day for me. PSCE up 7%, XOM up 6%, AVDV up 1.5%, AMR up 4%, BTU 3%, and everything otherwise mildly green.Added a sell limit order to Apple at $170 (just trimming).While I'm here, let me drop some charts (who cares about my portfolio). ---Let me steal some content [from this great thread](https://twitter.com/TaviCosta/status/1642951113673699329). Why is 'this time different' for oil and gas stocks?- [Oil and gas companies have massively deleveraged](https://i.imgur.com/eUD8n9F.png) in the past few decades. There is more space to sustainably pay out dividends and do share buybacks, as a result. And do cap-ex.- [We are at the trough of the capex cycle](https://i.imgur.com/ced1WCL.png). Unlike in 2008, there is no decade of capital expenditures booming to lead to a sudden oversupply when demand falls. There is no savior and new supply will require new capex. In my recent [copper post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1288qre/copper_investors_are_demonstrating_the_bystander/), I gave a [similar graph](https://i.imgur.com/vHaQpT8.png). Check it out, there are a dozen graphs making the bull case for copper/commodities.Further, as Costa points out, today we have the tailwinds of ESG mandates and much larger opposition to fossil fuels/mining *without the requisite supply alternatives or willingness to cut energy demand*.Edit: See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12aez60/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_03_2023/jeu7g66/) with some graphs about the decline of US shale.---Next, I think the S&P Tech sector is becoming wildly overvalued. [Here is a great Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/CameronDawson/status/1642230860773466113) I sourced this content from.- We've seen YTD massive outperformance [by the tech sector](https://i.imgur.com/vMikXvO.png). (Tech +19.8%S&P +5.5%S&P ex-tech +0.62%)- While the [forward EPS growth's move lower, forward PE ratios spike](https://i.imgur.com/XlcMnHK.png). The 'B' stands for blended. Dawson writes, "Tech forward PE is +25%  YTD, while Tech‚Äôs 2023 EPS growth forecast has been cut from -2% to -8% YoY."- This is an [abnormally large](https://i.imgur.com/RTz0nqJ.png) premium to the S&P 500, "even higher than at the pandemic bubble peak in late 2021!" (Dawson).- [The PE ratio of tech](https://i.imgur.com/tu53IbO.png). (The previous plot shows the premium over SPY, while this is just the raw level).So no, I'm not going to invest in the QQQ or add to my tech tilts. If anything, I shall continue to trim my tech positions ever so slightly and continue to target other sectors or broad index funds. Not that I think being short tech is advisable either, as our resident NVDA bear can attest.---Finally, I was beat to it, but GDP Nowcast was revised down yet again from 3.2% --> 2.5% --> 1.7%. Which seems far more reasonable of a forecast given the headwinds.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 09:53:39'] I need to post a write up on the transformation of Big Oil using Big Tech to become more lean & profitable.  I have been putting it off due to life and having too much to do and too little time.  However, I am one of those people that believe Oil is not going away in the lifetimes of anyone currently born on this world today. Here are 2 examples & 2 latest contracts awarded to Halliburton. Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) today announced that Petrobras will use the Landmark iEnergy¬Æ digital platform to address its subsurface challenges. The companies executed a contract that gives Petrobras access to the entire Halliburton Landmark DecisionSpace¬Æ 365 Geoscience Suite including cloud-based, next-generation technologies like Seismic Engine, Scalable Earth Modeling, Assisted Lithology Interpretation, DS365.ai, and Neftex¬Æ Predictions to support its strategic exploration and production programs.[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-accelerates-digital-transformation-halliburton-124500953.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-accelerates-digital-transformation-halliburton-124500953.html)Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) today announced that Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) has selected Halliburton Landmark‚Äôs DecisionSpace¬Æ 365 Well Construction applications powered by iEnergy¬Æ Hybrid Cloud to plan, design, and construct safe, cost effective, and productive wells.[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hess-selects-halliburton-well-construction-124500676.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hess-selects-halliburton-well-construction-124500676.html)&#x200B;There is a lot of potential growth coming to oil service & equipment stocks.  I believe $HAL and $SLB are well positioned to move the oil & gas industry in the 21st century.   This is not including $HAL investment into Carbon Capture which I believe is going to be huge in the near future as the world changings it's rhetoric from eliminating the use of crude oil to a need to reduce the carbon footprint from the continuous use of crude oil.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 12:12:08'] With options trading, and I know this depends a lot on the contract and underlying stock, but do you generally get out early while you're ahead say 10-20%? Or do you tend to stay in and risk it for a chance at more profit?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 07:50:11'] In some ways this market is even more overvalued than the one we had in 2021. Back then there was no guaranteed income in the form of government bonds so stocks could technically yield whatever the fuck and there would be almost nothing to compare it with. But a 3% eps yield on Microsoft now? after everything retail investors have seen. Sheeeeesh.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 04:33:49'] * Oil prices ticking back up.  OPEC will ensure they make back massive losses from Covid.  I also imagine they don't want to fall behind in real terms too much either going forward.* Housing shortage only marginally better.  Historically low inventory still.  March vacancy rate 6.4% for rentals.* Labor market still extremely tight 10.8M openings vs 5.9M so virtually unchanged 2:1.  Whether you think that's good or bad depending on your ideology, wages will continue to rise especially in services.Right now companies have shrinking earnings, and face increasingly higher capital costs as debt rolls over the next several years.  They only have three choices.1.  Keep losing money relatively.2.  Cut workers and try to squeeze remaining ones more, which works a bit but is obviously unsustainable.3.  Or they can keep raising prices.Without a reasonably sized recession, it seems 3 is the only solution.  Secular inflation seems inevitable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-19 09:59:45'] No-one expected this to be fast, and ultimately I don't expect the UK to say 'no'. Chip manufacturing I kind of see as a matter of defense, but designing chip architecture for chips that are going to get manufactured somewhere else is more iffy to me. And from the perspective of geopolitics it's going from Japanese to US ownership so I just don't see the issue. For western countries it's an economic competitiveness question and limited at that IMO. For China it's a security question.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-19 07:18:09'] NVDA owning ARM would be a bad situation for ARM as a business.  It would give strength to RISC-V because other businesses would not want to give a competitor money, and they would not want a competitor to control the ISA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-23 08:00:40'] I feel the need to post this reminder every so often:COVERED CALLS ARE NOT FREE MONEY, THEY ARE A HEDGE.By selling covered calls you ARE betting against the growth of stock that you own. Yes, it absolutely CAN be profitable, but  there is risk. If you get assigned, you may lose money if the market exceeds strike+premium. Yes, even if you don't re-buy, you still lost on the gains you would have made if you didn't sell the call. If you opt to sell puts instead of re-buying you are once again betting against growth: if the market gain exceeds premium collected you've missed gains again (but the reverse is also true).CC/CSP strategies require a certain set of conditions to get good gains. **You need growth, but not too much. You need the expectation of volatility, but not the actual price volatility.** If the underlying drops more than your premiums, you lose money, if it gains past your strike more than your premiums, you also lose. It's not nearly as safe of a strategy as it seems.

Nvidia is on the cutting edge of technology that's forming the future, AI, Edge Computing, Data Centers, etc. I believe they're also developing software to compliment their chips that's going to act as a SaaS reoccurring revenue model.Shorting winners because of valuation metrics is a fools errand. Perhaps the market momentarily sells down or the ARM deal doesn't go through and the stock takes a hit. Then your puts pay off. Otherwise, I think you're wasting money and time.If you wanna short a semi company. Take a look at NXPI. Massive insider selling outside of scheduled sales.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-26 23:04:56'] You are not wrong, NVDA is pricy across various conventional key metrics, even PEG: [https://imgur.com/a/BCHBBrO](https://imgur.com/a/BCHBBrO). (Head to head comparison with peers in the industry)However, considering their dominant position in GPUs and datacenters and projected growth rates the valuation can be justified. While any DCF model that deals with ludicrous growth rates (as with NVDA) should be taken with a grain of salt, the 3 different ones i have on hand, when inputting conservative estimates all arrive at a intrinsic value around 220.In short: Don't short this stock. Find something else to short.Disclaimer: I do not own the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-26 23:42:49'] As others have said, NVIDIA is high multiples, but in the context of other terrible companies in the tech realm, it's not that over valued.  Tesla is the usual.comparison, much of that overvaluation on autonomous driving an area where NVIDIA is making.actual un-hyped progress with various automakers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-27 00:44:14'] You're stepping in front of a freight train. People with TSLA puts made out like bandits when it fell from its current ATH, so maybe you can make money too if something like that happens, but you'd have to time it really well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-27 00:50:11'] The answer for if you are doing the right thing depends on where you ask. If you ask r/valueinvesting I think you are gonna get more people agreeing.I myself agree that it is overpriced even with their growth. However, the Market is still expanding and they are constantly making more revenue and people Likes the stock. So I would keep away from the shorts.But do your due diligence and look up if it is a rusk to take. In my opinion if it is just because P/E is high then you are making a mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-27 06:18:00'] Additional thought. If you're going to short NVDA, you might as well short TSLA, Apple, AMD, AMZN. Basically all the most wildly successful profitable innovative companies lol. There's a reason their stock prices have gone up so much. Stocks don't just "fall down flat on their faces" when bears suddenly realize their ratios have gone too high. Like others have stated there is a real possibility of the entire NASDAQ pulling back but you don't have any idea when that will be.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 09:59:20'] Lots of people seem to be complaining on how stuff is overvalued and what not. It seems likely to be true but the indexes are still off their highs. Look at what happened to Tesla from 2020-2021 and how it destroyed shorts and was exuberantly priced, same thing can happen with Nvidia and it can stay higher for longer. Markets can stay irrational longer than individuals can stay solvent. If someone regularly DCA's from their paycheck they get to average in the lows and the highs and general 30+ year outlook is that USA should go up or we have bigger problems. And we are NOT Japan... Also there is a strong possibility that high beta growth stuff was expensive before but got overshot to the downside and is just finding a reasonable floor, we don't really know.  I'm long but hedge, and my hedge from SQQQ from 2 weeks ago is down over 20% and my covered calls are near the money.

Inflation will almost certainly drop below below 3% this summer due to the base year effect.  Things are looking good so far.

What this means now is that they can still make an announcement via 8K in this upcoming week (apparently they need to get 13 signatures physically signed), but they cannot start the actual buybacks until the earnings report is released end of April. There is a blackout period that starts April 1st. Some were hoping they would both announce the resolution and initiate buybacks before today, but it looks like that will have to wait. Patience will be key here.It looks like BTU had large buying right before close today, likely in anticipation of big moves coming up. Quarter end selling might have also impacted today's price action at least early on (BTU is not an ESG name funds want to have on their portfolio). There will be selling pressure from Elliott Management looking to exit their position, but shareholder returns will likely bring in plenty of new buyers, including BTU itself, to bring stock price up. I'm roughly equally bullish on AMR/BTU, with the risk of BTU not executing on the capital returns making up for AMR having less upside.

In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:23:17'] Interesting article on hacker news, apparently the staff at Meta dont use their VR headsets much either. I cant use VR at all because I get vertigo and know many other do. migraines too. so I thought Metaverse was doomed to fail from the get go. Anyway...Google have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording "their precious".I am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...Though its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.NVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. Same with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. my view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.meantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:58:24'] This is why AMD bought Xilinx.  Xilinx is the leader in FPGAs.And $35,000 for a single Nvidia H100 GPU creates alot of incentive for data scientists & corporations to find cheaper alternatives, whether it's through training method or hardware (Founder of ChatGPT says large language models are already being phased out for smaller models that cost factors less).  AI is still in very early stages.  The costs will come down dramatically to the detriment of Nvidia.  In 2007, it cost $10 Million to sequence a human genome; today it costs $200.  For AI to be ubiquitous, the costs have to, and will come down.

POST_TEXT: b"Greetings. I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  \n\n\n* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. \n* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts.

Ethics is no concern to them sadly, but that's reality and will speed up any progress.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 10:17:46'] Office with AI will be worth every damn penny to companies and absolutely MSFT will up charge for it. People focus on AI taking jobs but the truth is productivity will shoot up and could end up just making more jobs. If we could increase the efficiency of employees there‚Äôs big incentives to hire more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 09:38:57'] Aren't you a bit too late with your assessment? Everyone has already realized that a long time ago, at least several months ago. Microsoft started investing in OpenAI back in 2019. ChatGPT was launched in November 2022. Microsoft upped their OpenAI investment to $10B this January. AI tech revolution has been clear from the get-go, and even more since the release of OpenAI's GPT models. It's never too late to buy MSFT though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:42:34'] > Ethics is no concern to them sadlyRandom statement without any context, wtf is that shit?> GPT4 they are probably winning the AI raceAs with most races it usually last longer than you believe right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:29:29'] I'm betting on stocks that actually can use quick AI development to add real value to their products/services. So yeah, Microsoft, Apple, but also Amazon. And controversially, Nvidia I'm not really sure if they are in such a position. Also, AI can potentially disrupt the tech sector (e.g. Google eventually losing vs Bing), so I guess I'll stay focused on S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 ETF. :)

With chip and processor integration on supercomputers, one needs to train the computer how to think which most users do not realize.  The next decade will be more productive but they need to come from peer reviewed sources.  AI can not discriminate trash data from legit yet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:35:17'] I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don‚Äôt 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It‚Äôs very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it‚Äôs human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it‚Äôs like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I‚Äôll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I‚Äôm also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries. That‚Äôs my Ted talk thanks for reading üôè
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:20:32'] The problem is that we are in a market that does not understand reality of economics anymore. It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. https://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768This is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.The Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist."Where on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.Secondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of "investors" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.It will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:23:20'] One simple argument against 'bubble' is that p/e is at 20x. That is a little high by historical standards, but hardly extreme. The valuation of the market is fundamentally reasonable as it is backed by earnings. A 'bubble' occurs when an asset is being bid up by speculation and becomes detached from fundamentals. That is not the case here. Some argue future earnings will go down. Maybe. But where we are right now is not a bubble

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-18 10:02:43'] I think the 21st is suppose to be the cut off date to be guaranteed your shares split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-18 09:09:13'] It will work just like a cash dividend, except the dividend here is shares. So anyone who has 1 share on June 21st will be given 3 additional shares of NVIDIA on July 19th, regardless of what they do with their share after June 21. So the share price will go down 75% after June 21st since buying a share after that date no longer will get you 3 more shares, and all the shares are now diluted even though the additional shares will not be technically given out until July 20.Just like how a stock drops after the cash dividend ex date even if the cash won't be given out for another month.Edit: Idk what the downvote is for, this is the exact answer to the question... The benefit of buying before June 21st is that you are buying 4 shares, price will quarter after hours since after that date you will only be buying 1 share

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 13:46:37'] During a market downturn, many investors look for opportunities to buy stocks at a discounted price. Some investors may look for companies that have a strong financial position and a history of steady growth, but whose stock price has been affected by the downturn. Other investors may look for companies that are undervalued based on their fundamental metrics, such as their price-to-earnings ratio or their dividend yield. Ultimately, the specific stocks you may consider will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall investment strategy. It's important to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.

POST_TEXT: b" Hi everyone,\n\nI want to start by clarifying that this is ***not*** financial advice.\n\nI believe that there is a semiconductor bubble that is anywhere between 2 to 3 quarters from popping.\n\nA combination of growing recession, war, supply chain, and decreasing demand pressures exasperated by overvaluation in the chip space is a ticking time bomb.\n\n# Let's start by reviewing the decreasing demand for semiconductors...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>WASHINGTONApril 6, 2023The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales totaled $39.7 billion during the month of February 2023, a decrease of 4.0% compared to the January 2023 total of $41.3 billion and 20.7% less than the February 2022 total of $50.0 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the[World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization](https://www.wsts.org/)and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U."
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:04:14'] Your thesis is all over the place. You talk about NVDA being your primary reason for shorting, but plan to take no positions in NVDA. You take short positions on TSMC which you compare to NVDA as an example of how much better TSMC is priced. NVDA and TSMC are also very different businesses. This is very poorly thought out. I think you should reevaluate what your actual position is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:13:37'] My god this is the worst DD I‚Äôve seen on Reddit. Semiconductors are not just TSMC, AMD, INTC & NVDA.You haven‚Äôt mentioned semi caps, data center or automotive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:51:21'] First off, semiconductors have been a boom/bust industry forever. Second, if China makes a move for Taiwan there will be so much interruption that whatever happens to semiconductors at that point would be peanuts in the grand scheme of things. Lastly, comparing chip manufactures to chip designers is comparing hardware to software. Manufacturing hardware has high costs to participate/lower margins, about 3-4 choices if you want to produce at scale, and a moat that is all but impossible to cross for any new competition. Chip designers are basically just software companies that focus on chip design; they have low overhead/higher margins, practically no barrier to entry, and with that much fiercer competition. As for your assessment, it seems to boil down to you believe the semiconductors manufactures and designers run in democratic countries are in a bubble that is about to pop because of war and overpriced shares, and this will lead to China having some sort of significant advantage. The problem with that is the war has been going on for over a year and already has been heavily priced in, the shares for designers are not overpriced due to semiconductors themselves but due to fervor over AI, and China is heavily restricted from accessing the best methods and materials for producing semiconductors, so where is that supposed advantage coming from given the lack of access to the necessary resources? Also, it should be mentioned that we are likely close to the [bottom of the bust part of this cycle if history is any indicator,](https://i.imgur.com/nC3w0fz.png) so what makes you think we are in a moment worse than the Covid shutdowns, worse than the Global Financial Crisis, and worse than the dotcom bubble?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:41:30'] Everyone always equates "semiconductors" to purely NVIDIA and AMD, but totally ignores the Analog, Mixed Signal sector that have rock solid diversification and therefore future outlook. Analog Devices (ADI), Texas Instruments (TXN), NXP, etc. To me, that's the real industry. NVIDIA and AMD will have higher swings and are growth companies. The others are still >100% over 5 years and perform through down markets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:17:03'] If you genuinely believe China will invade Taiwan anytime even vaguely soon then you shouldn‚Äôt be in the market at all. I‚Äôm not quite sure what this belief is that Taiwan is just another Ukraine and only Chinese and Taiwanese equities will crash. Even if you forget about guaranteed WWIII and a crash of global equities just look at individual stocks - where do you think Apple get their chips from? What do you think will happen to Tesla‚Äôs revenue and factories? What about every single S&P company that relies on China‚Äôs supply chains?Anyone who creates short positions based on China invading Taiwan has clearly not thought it through.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:14:17'] I think the threat of Chinese aggression against Taiwan has actually decreased over the last year. After watching Russian get bogged down and humiliated in a land war against a far inferior opponent, I seriously doubt China would attempt a military operation against an island based foe. You also forgot to mention automotive. Both Apple and Google are expanding integration into new cars. They basically plan to make your automobile a rolling cell phone. This will only increase the already high demand for semi's in the automotive industry. We may see a downturn. This has always been a cyclical sector. However, long term I only see demand increasing. I wouldnt attempt to time semi market, but that's just me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:03:25'] There are a few issues I see here. One there doesn't seem to be an illogical investment in semiconductors. This is more of a scanning the environment thing. For example I don't see a large media/social media push and hype for semiconductor stocks. If an insta model starts pushing SOXL I will sell.  HahaSecond, semiconductors have been hit hard and there hsve been lots of issues over the last couple years. It sounds like they still have a rough road a head. That doesn't mean it's a bubble. It's maybe a "hold" or buy with long term in mind.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 15:54:12'] I sell semis for a living.  I can tell you the downturn started mid last year for consumer products and it is just starting in automotive. I‚Äôve quoted lead times up to 104 weeks last year for some automotive qualified chips.  These LTs are now down to 26 weeks or so with a couple exceptions of Microchip and ST.  Microchip is always a mess.  This is a combination of adding capacity as well as lower demand.   For the most part suppliers who had the most success through the shortage had their own fabs and didn‚Äôt use TSMC or other contract manufacturers.  That way they could concentrate on more popular products instead of when the order came in. Ironically Microchip has their own fabs.  The consumer world is the bulk of the chips and it is a completely different environment than automotive but automotive is still about 15-20% of global usage. Depending on who you ask.  Automotive requirements for chips have much more stringent testing parameters.  This is only growing with EV, chargers and regular ICE vehicles.  I expect to see that chunk of the pie grow more in proportion.   There could be a glut of semis in the next few years in some categories but I expect automotive may be the place to be when this happens as I don‚Äôt think it will be as severe.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:37:01'] Semis always will have boom/bust cycles, that's just the nature of the industry and of upgrading hardware. It happens in cycles, you can see it in earnings going back decades. You can try and short the "boom" but that's fairly risky to call. Also shorting semi ETFs is a bad idea even if your thesis is true bc ADI and TXN could start busting while KLAC and AVGO are still booming or vice versa since they serve different sectors. You need to identify specific stocks and where they are within their cycle. Not bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 20:39:38'] Its primarily gambling in my opinion, especially triple leverage. Its a great way to lose money, two coworkers lost over $1 million between the both of them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 18:22:31'] I was trying to find the exact thing myself...ETF to gain on market loss.   From what I understand they are short term derivatives (measured in days) so don't want to hold them to long.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 20:11:50'] I don't make enough money to play with fire
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 06:41:58'] This is the wrong place to ask this question, unless you want a bunch of people telling you not to use these instruments.They are incredibly useful as a hedge. The leverage means you only need a small position, the fact that you are using an ETF means that you lose a few percent a year, plus tracking error, vs the premium on options which can be 25%-150% of the underlying per year. However, timing is essential and it's important to your take gains and use them to invest in real securities. Hopefully the ones that you are hedging against.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 07:14:49'] For day trading only. These ETFs are rebalanced daily. Markets generally go up. So every time the ETF is rebalanced on a day the ETF goes down, there is a loss captured. These securities are mechanically built to decay in value. You should short them, not buy them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 20:46:29'] As others said, it‚Äôs highly risky.  Check their long term performance - most do NOT return 3x the way you would expect.

What are you doing? (surely many of you own NVDA)"
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 13:33:19'] I really don't think NVDA is overvalued. Its forward P/E is 40 - lower than AMZN's (45), not much higher than MSFT's (30), etc. It isn't like they have some kind of crazy 100+ forward P/E evaluation. Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now. And even more forward looking, they are the overwhelming leader in AI with CUDA so I just don't see their growth slowing any time soon. IMO, their valuation is more than fair given their future growth trajectory.

I plan to hold the stock long term but wouldn't mind selling to reposition after the split.\n\n\n\nIf I sell my shares before market close of July 19, will I be able to receive the additional split shares? Is it better to sell before split, wait for correction and buy back again or should I just hold through the split?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:15:53'] If you sold your shares you wouldn't be entitled to split shares lol.You need to hold shares through market close on the 19th July for them to split on the 20th.Honestly I think trying to time a sell and re-buy is a bad move. We don't know if there will be a correction, the share price could rise and you'd have to buy back in at a higher price.If you're strategy is a long term hold then do just that - hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:19:35'] No.. stock split isn't something complicated or can cheat. You will get 3 additional shares for each 1 that you own. If you sell at any point before those additional shares are given to you, the new owner will get those sharesStock split does not change the market cap and therefore the value of the company. If there are any shifts before or after a split in price, that's purely based on investor psychologyIn my perspective, NVDA has grown very strongly over the last few weeks. Just a feeling tells me it might decrease in price soon but since it has great outlook, the price will recover even if it does decline slightlySince you said you are holding long, I would not consider any sale to buy back
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:32:54'] Many fail to understand how these splits work.If you have 1 share valued at $800 before the split, you will then have 4 shares valued at $200 after the split.  Nothing changes with total value.  The amount of shares increase proportionally for the split ratio.  (This often spurs retail investment, but that is a side effect.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 00:25:16'] I bought some shares around split announcement.  Glad I did as I'm up like 30% from then.  My plan is to ride the split and hopefully have the opportunity to buy more on the post split dip I think will happen.

Kind of a gamble. I personally think that it's best to set stop losses up to the split, then make a date you wish to sell and just ride the wave. I'm in the camp of decline after split, but many think differently.Edit: read below reply.

I still want to stay in the stock for the long-term (5-10 years) because of the industry itself.  Anyway, these shares sit in a Roth account. I've a feeling MU will pop after earnings tomorrow. Maybe it will trade between $65-$70. My idea was if we do get a pop, I was going to sell covered calls at the $70 strike price and if my shares get called away - I would then buy back in when MU does its inevitable fall back to lows $60s. For instance, If I can buy back in at $62, I could reduce my cost basis from $86 a share to $78 a share ($70-$62 = $8 per share reduced cost basis).  Because I can not tax-loss harvest in a Roth anyway, I wouldn't have to wait 30 days or anything like that.

POST_TEXT: b"Wondering what you guys think of my assessment.\n\nI sold off the last of my NVDA the other day.\n\nI bought into them back at the dawn of modern Artificial Intelligence (2016ish) when they were at the forefront of AI and it looked like they were going to be the future. And they were. They went from $14\\~$22 as I bought in, to about $540\\~$575 as I sold. It was a good run but I realized I had to cash out.\n\nWhile I don't think the company is done, I do think, first Apple punched them in the kidney by not continuing to support their products. Then, Tesla knocked them down by stealing their engineers and making their own chip. Then AMD kicked them around by making faster cheaper chips that use less power. Then Apple thrust a knife in their backs with the M1 chip having neural specific cores embedded in its silicon. The only thing holding them up was the 3000 RTX series that they've failed to deliver and the CUDA architecture that most AI devs still use.\n\nNvidia may have a comeback with the 40"

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 00:51:10'] Nvidia stands to win from Apple's M-series Macs, indirectly.Apple clearly demonstrated that ARM, not x86, is the future not just for energy efficient computing, but also for CPU-intensive computing. Nvidia recently purchased ARM Holdings, positioning themselves to profit from critical IP no matter which OEM is first to take on Apple with high-performance ARM hardware.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 02:11:20'] I hold NVDA and have done for a little longer than OP.  I sold some earlier this year to rebalance the old portfolio because they did indeed have a hell of a run and things were looking lopsided.  But I'm still holding a number of shares because they are a great company and they are still going places. My next adventure is NET which I think will have a similar trajectory.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-17 04:44:52'] I have mixed feelings. I did sell mine and missed quite a run this year, so that sucks. But on one hand they are rather good, on another hand it feels like they are really doing poorly on execution. They release a GPU that they cannot supply in any meaningful quantity - but there is corona and everyone else is having issues as well.But lots of their cool technology is never really broadly implemented, sometimes due to them keeping it proprietary, sometimes because perfection is the enemy of good enough and sometimes because they actually need to work with developers.   It feels like Google to some extend, where good ideas and projects go to die.  It does seem like CUDA and AI is something that is still so small that they support it rather well, and I know companies that say their documentation and hardware is far superior.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 18:46:49'] If NVDA gets the Arm deal approved, it‚Äôll make a huge gap up. If not, probably a huge gap down. Data center sales were flat as of last earnings report, but long term growth there and in just about all other areas looks great once they can overcome near term supply constraints. NVDA and QCOM are two of my favorites, but I‚Äôm waiting out the volatility in individual tech stocks until it feels like we know what‚Äôs happening with rates. Could be a mistake not to add more now, but no one knows. My gut says volatility isn‚Äôt over, so even if it goes up some more, there may be another opportunity soon.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 21:44:10'] I don't think so.NVIDIA is expensive when it comes to corporate (and consumer too) accounts.  I learned this first hand when they stopped the Grid K2 support and put their new grid card onto a license based cost model.One thing that many other car companies are learning from TSLA is vertically integration.  This is the main reason TSLA margin is so high and how TSLA was able to navigate the ship shortage much better (they re-wrote the code to use an alternative chip in a matter of weeks) than the rest of the auto companies.  They'll be less likely to farm out major systems of their cars to a third party vendor.If company X wants the cameras and radars,  it will do directly to the source rather than paying another middle man.Here's a recent example:  TSLA wants to put more media contents/games onto its cars, it didn't try to integrate NVIDIA shield (use this as an example but it could have been XBOX,PS5 etc) into the cars but rather buy the chip (from AMD) and do the integration itself.

I've only opened small positions in a few of these because I'm a pretty cautious investor,  Do a DCF with 5% FFR and the growth decline in those companies. They are still very expensive.

POST_TEXT: b'I have been looking for a play recently since Im flush with cash after selling a few plays. Ive been better at being patient and was really close to buying micron puts at close yesterday. This morning I almost had didnt buy it remorse when I saw Lenevo has instructed internal buyers and sub tiers to stop using micron memory. The stock instantly dropped 2% and I thought I missed my chance (also trying to not chase plays). But now its back to positive territory. Part of my thesis yesterday was that the China ban was being under appreciated since what China says and what it does or usually two different things. The fake reason is just for domestic consumption and we investors should see this coming that they would ban micron in a much wider swathe of products then they claimed. Add this that micron is trading in a range it was swinging in for a large chunk of 2021 when it was earning over 2$ a share instead of losing 2$ a share. Memory glut hit them hard, consumption of memory product'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:04:38'] Though I agree with you in general, my main fear is the current AI craze. Even if the memory Micron sells to GPUs doesn't compensate for the loss of business in phones and PCs, any link to AI, however remote, seems to lead to crazy buying. I won't short it over the long-term but fortune favors the bold though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 16:24:47'] It's true that no matter how ya spin it this can't be like 2008.  It's like 2008 was really a loss of innocence.  Crazy to think that back then it was a literal bonanza, people really thought all of it was sustainable and the banks were trading fancy derivatives and stuff.  Then boom.Don't get me wrong the risks now are real, too.  After 15 years of ultra-loose monetary policy there's bound to be hidden risks in the system, as we're seeing now.  And we definitely had our own little Covid bonanza.  But I don't think we ever shook off the lessons of '08, there was always a sense of "not so fast".  I dunno.  And I feel like there was more faith in our institutions and stuff.  More faith in humanity.  Now when I look around I see less optimism and more despair.  So for that reason, it's not right to say that this is another version of 2008.  Even if it becomes very bad, which we don't know yet, it's totally different.  If anything, this is a continuation of what happened then.  Very interesting to see how everything will play out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 15:59:55'] Ben Felix recently had a video on international diversification that I recommend checking out. He does more than just repeat the mantra that past performance doesn't predict future performance, like many cases for international performance do. [Here is a recent Ben Felix Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1632884241145970690) summarizing his points. Let me give my qualitative summary:- You're better off geographically  diversifying *within* a single industry than diversifying across industries *within* a single country. - Although a large portion of the S&P 500 is composed of multinational firms with global revenue, there are *still* diversification benefits to owning international index funds. [And to add, you're missing out on foreign companies who benefit from US revenue flowing abroad]- The previous point is especially valid for subsectors like international small cap value (which I tilt via AVDV). The previous points claims that a company like Nestle or Novartis will add diversification benefits to existing US multinationals like Pepsi or Pfizer. But  highly insulated small caps around the world are even more uncorrelated to these US companies. Similarly, US small cap value stocks are useful in volatile moments because they are less exposed to foreign exchange shocks or geopolitical risk.- Much of the outperformance in US stocks is due to valuation changes as opposed to fundamentals. - Ben Felix wouldn't approve, but you can also make market timing arguments about the cheapness of international (and value and small cap) stocks. Ex-US stocks have substantially underperformed in recent years, so you're effectively buying the dip. There are also currency tailwinds since you can buy more with a strong USD.- Some might claim that ex-US stocks are cheap for a reason. The market timing case argues that they are not just cheap compared to US stocks, but that the discounts themselves are at historic levels. The same applies to small cap or value stocks, which are at the 98th percentile of cheapness. Yes, the UK/Japan/etc. will always trade at a discount to the US, will it always be *this* much of a discount? As previously mentioned, US stocks outperformed by getting more expensive rather than by out-growing  their EPS. Ex-US stocks have the reasonable EPS growth without the valuation premium.Diversifying will therefore increase your risk adjusted performance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 06:42:27'] u/Miko109 u/shortyafter u/Sad-Round8961I think Japan is evidence QE may possibly work at the zero lower bound without really bad inflation as a necessary consequence.  It seems reasonable critics of the Fed do not disagree with that.  What they object to is why do central banks have massive balance sheets way past the emotional panics that cause credit crunches?  Not only does there seem to be a lack of evidence of benefit for there to be so much extra liquidity, there seems to be a shifting of the demand curve for reserves.  As the banking system has larger reserves, it adapts, regulators adapt, and now we just need more liquidity.  Additionally there doesn't seem to be a good framework of how much reserves we are even supposed to "optimally" need.George Selgin has stated in his working [paper](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-50-updated-3.pdf):>The Fed‚Äôs actual interest on reserves policy resembles this last alternative, the difference being its use of subsidized interest on reserve payments instead of high mandatory reserve requirements to boost banks‚Äô demand for reserves. That difference makes the interest on reserves alternative less financially repressive in so far as, instead of exposing banks to a larger required reserve tax burden, it lowers that burden, allowing banks in turn to raise their deposit rates somewhat, instead of having to reduce them as they must when they‚Äôre compelled to hold more non-interest-bearing reserves. Interest on reserves therefore has both ‚Äúincome‚Äù and ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù effects on financial intermediation, where the first increases its overall extent, while the second directs a larger share away from private borrowers and toward the Fed. An increased interest rate on both required and excess reserves will be financially repressive so long as the income effect is small relative to the substitution effect. Since the increase in banks‚Äô net interest income consists mainly if not solely of income earned on their (relatively modest) required reserve balances, and most studies suggest that the demand for bank deposits is not very interest elastic, that‚Äôs almost certainly the case.>One of the most disconcerting features of the post-crisis recovery has been the ‚Äúgreat productivity slowdown‚Äù that has accompanied it (Kravis 2017). Since the start of the recession in late 2007, labor productivity has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1percent‚Äîfar below the 2.3 percent average growth rate between 1947 and 200. The growth rate of total factor productivity also fell below its pre-crisis trend, where it has remained ever since...San Francisco Fed economists Michael Redmond and Willem Van Zandweghe (2016, p.41) consider a reduced post-crisis supply of credit the ‚Äúprimary suspect‚Äù in the post-crisis decline in U.S. total factor productivity, blaming it for having ‚Äúprevented [established] firms from investing in innovations‚Äù and also for making it harder for new firms to enter the market (ibid, p. 39).The central bank of Norway recognized this problem and got off the ample reserves framework in 2010, [stating](https://static.norges-bank.no/contentassets/cfc83348f4574a719dd5a4ce70a48840/consultative_document_06102010.pdf?v=03/09/2017123145&ft=.pdf):>When Norges Bank keeps reserves relatively high for a period, it appears that banks gradually adjust to this level‚Ä¶With ever increasing reserves in the banking system, there is a risk that Norges Bank assumes functions that should be left to the market. It is not Norges Bank‚Äôs role to provide funding for banks‚Ä¶If a bank has a deficit of reserves towards the end of the day, banks must be able to deal with this by trading in the interbank market.The ECB seems to be recognizing the dangers as well:https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230302~41273ad467.en.html>In the ongoing review of our operational framework, we are analysing whether in the future we will operate under a floor or a corridor system. We hope to conclude this review by the end of the year.>One important element in our discussion is the amount of central bank reserves required to effectively steer short-term interest rates in either a floor or a corridor system. This amount informs our decision-making as to when balance sheet normalisation might need to be halted. >Our current estimates suggest that the amount of central bank reserves currently held by the banking sector exceeds, by a significant margin, the level necessary to steer short-term market rates close to our key policy rate even under a floor system.>This implies that the current size of our balance sheet is larger than necessary to effectively implement our monetary policy stance. As such, maintaining a large bond portfolio absorbs valuable policy space that may be needed if policy rates were to become constrained again by the effective lower bound.>Shrinking the balance sheet, to the extent possible, is therefore both prudent and efficient.>The second reason for reducing the APP portfolio is related to the side effects of running a large balance sheet.>It is well documented that bond purchases can cause asset price valuations in financial and real estate markets to diverge from their economic fundamentals, thus raising both financial stability risks and wealth inequality.>Maintaining too large a balance sheet may also have undesirable side effects.>One is that it could jeopardise central bank‚Äôs credibility by giving rise to accusations of financial and fiscal dominance.>A second side effect is that maintaining a larger balance sheet than necessary increases the Eurosystem‚Äôs exposure to credit and duration risk. The probability and extent of net losses are significantly higher the larger the amount of long-term fixed-rate assets the central bank holds on its balance sheet.So Japan seems like a reasonable data point for ZIRP, QE and their relationship with inflation.  But it doesn't say much about what we're supposed to do after ZIRP.  Moreover QE itself is still a massive experiment.  It's important to consider additionally that Japan is idiosyncratic with a dangerously low birthrate, ageing population, government price controls, as well as a deeply ingrained culture of resisting inflation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 22:05:08'] Decided I want to reduce my portfolio allocation to individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds back into index funds. I got serious about investing at the end of 2021 and while I still want to devote a small portion of my portfolio to stock picks, I admit I got carried away and ended up holding about 35 different companies at one point. I've trimmed that down to 28 now, but I'm still wasting too much time stressing over earnings calls and company-specific risks. Currently I have about 40% of my portfolio in individual stocks but I'd like to cut that down to 20-25% by the end of this year, though I'll hold certain positions longer if I can avoid realizing losses or paying unnecessary taxes.After the recent mini-rally in tech I am now at break even or slightly positive on a number of stocks including ABNB, AMD, CRM, MSFT, MU, SPOT, and TTD. Seems like a good time to decide which of these tickers I should reduce exposure to, sell completely, or hold for the long term. I'm also bagholding others including UPST (-68%) and ZIM (-53%) which I'm not sure if I should just cut loose or hold and hope for better days (these were by far my worst picks at the valuations they were at).I'm done with stock picking going forward unless I have really strong conviction in a company or the risk/reward ratio is overwhelmingly in its favor giving it multibagger potential. Just wondering out loud trying to figure out my exit strategies at this point...tempted to just cut loose all the tickers I listed above at Monday open (together they make up about 10% of my overall portfolio). I'm not really trying to time the market, I just want more peace of mind by putting that money into index funds instead (though I'd likely DCA the proceeds over the next several months given the current market volatility).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 10:38:22'] I have a couple of questions about owning the same stock in a bunch of different accounts, some normal accounts, but others Roth and regular IRA.1. If I own shares of AAPL in a Roth IRA, regular IRA, and also a normal brokerage account, my question is... does the cost basis for the Roth IRA investment or the regular IRA investment have anything at all to do with the cost basis for the standard account investment? I mean in regards to taxes. For example, let's say my cost basis for AAPL was $170 in my "standard" brokerage account. But my cost basis in my Roth is $135, and my cost basis in my regular IRA is $141. The only thing that matters from a tax standpoint is the $170 right?2. Does the wash sale rule apply to purchases/sales in the Roth and regular IRA accounts? For example, let's say I sell my AAPL in my standard account right now, and it would be a loss. Then, a week later, I make a $7500 contribution to my Roth for 2023 and I buy AAPL for it's current price. Would this cause a problem?The way I think about Roth and regular IRA transactions, is that they're in their own private ecosphere and they have absolutely nothing to do with anything outside of it. Their own private island. But maybe I'm wrong in assuming this.

I‚Äôve seen literal flat lines with Asian markets, where they trade +/-0.1% throughout their entire trading session and only gap up or down when US trading hours start.

POST_TEXT: b'Year end and Im down 19%. My 5 year old daughter is down 14%! For comparison sake the S&P500 is down 18.11%. She has a Schwab UGMA account and gets $50/mo and has been picking a stock a month since she turned 4 (20 months ago). Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Dominos, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc) and usually driven by questions like, can I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock? And can I buy YouTube stock? Or mom shops at Target and I like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.\n\nIm seriously considering just copying her buys each month. Id be better off.\n\nEdit: many were asking for a list of her holdings. Here you go.\n\nATVI, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, DPZ, MAR, MCD, MSFT, NFLX, NKE, NVDA, PTON, PG, SBUX, TGT, TSLA, KO, TSN, DIS\n\nSome above shes bought multiple months. DIS is her largest position, followed by SBUX, NFLX, and GOOG. Some are smaller because she bought a few each months with the Schwab'

Bought when I could. Eventually sold at 500% gain for Tesla only to crash again. Turned 75k into a million in didn't have a broker -Asked Morgan Stanley guy about taking some profits.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 12:09:44'] It sounds like your 5 year old daughter has been crushing it in the stock market, with a portfolio that's down only 14% this year despite the S&P 500 being down 18.11%. I mean, seriously, how many 5 year olds can say they've outperformed the S&P 500? Not many, that's for sure. In fact, I'm thinking of just copying her investment strategy. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the lead of a kid who's making investment picks based on her love of cheese pizza and vanilla milkshakes?    Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and that no one ‚Äì not even a 5 year old ‚Äì has a crystal ball when it comes to the stock market. But hey, if your daughter's portfolio continues to beat the S&P 500, I might just have to start taking investment advice from her too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 14:02:15'] smart: so she is ignoring all smallcaps and most midcaps and going for half staples and with companies with strong balance sheet and strong fcf+she is well diversified with +10 stocks, 15-20 is the sweet spot.ill say that approach is better than going with the sp500, i would re ask every Q if she still likes every company or if she would like to add more but by dropping the one she likes less.\+make her a pie chart with all picked companies so she can drop one to add one more if she wants. Which is better than just adding all the ones she likes and ending up with +50 companies.

Short one company and buy another in the same sector.  Like short McDonald's and long Wendy's (obviously have to do math to make the positions equal). With your daughters diversity, it's great she is learning and would agree to continue this road, but for you, you might as well buy the index.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:43:47'] children generally do better stock picking since the brands they're interested in typically are main-stream things all kids at that age like. since kids like it parents buy it and the companies do well. older people have developed their own tastes and also are typically "out-of-touch". also, if kids jump on something it normally does well. if they complain enough their parents will buy and if the parents have deep enough pockets they might sink in a lot of money to keep their kids happy. so, yeah, I would trust a kid to know what's hip and what to invest in
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:09:54'] Yeah... if you like the product other people might too. Good product is foundational to a solid profitable company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:30:25'] Wow OP this is a great idea for young kids. Absolutely love this. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt quite fully understand what they are doing but it‚Äôs a great way for them to learn and invest at the same time. Not for nothing but I bet you here portfolio does well for a long time. She‚Äôs clearly picking the biggest and smartest companies out there! When I have kids I plan on copying this method
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 09:53:28'] Do you lead her to say a specific brand? Using your examples as my examples: "Can I buy YouTube stock?".

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.\n\nI felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it and forgot about it until last year, when I did an update.  Now that it's been another year, here are the results using the closing price Friday 1-8-21 and the closing price Tuesday (intended to make this post Wednesday but forgot).\n\n*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (% change uses full price).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:03:48'] This would be a fun annual exercise for multiple investing subreddits/communities.For example in a Canadian investing sub you'd see a "Reddit Canada ETF" with Canadian banks, railways, Enbridge, some energy companies, and some of the most known US stocks like the megacaps.  You'd see some things drop out of favour at exactly the wrong time (while they are down in price) like those energy stocks.Bogleheads would probably be pretty constant, though you might see things like small cap value ETFs go into and out of favour.Dividends this year would be SCHD, JEPI, O, and some other individual stocks.  JEPI will probably get replaced by whatever the next hot, high yield ETF comes along just like the xYLDs have fallen out of favour.

Perhaps this thread could keep us up to date on NVDA/ARM news."
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:02:24'] I'm not sure it's as disastrous as you are making it seem. I don't think ARM is priced in. If it goes through, I am sure NVDA will shoot up a bit. If it doesn't go through, I don't think anyone would be really surprised. Maybe a dip for a couple days, but no one thinks NVDA needs ARM to succeed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:10:21'] I  must be the only guy who thinks that NVIDIA is getting ahead of itself in stock price.  I would be surprise it'll end up in the low 600s by the end of Q2.  I think the recent run up is associated with the stock split news.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 16:46:26'] I had ARM back when it was an independent stock. ARM chip is in everything.   Then bought into TSM to at least stay close to it when it was acquired by Softbank.  I found TSM a good play to keep me close to many of the semiconductor companies who outsource to TSM (like NVDA).  I like ARM, but found NVDA a bit over valued for my taste.  I have been buying into QCom, and smiled at the recent news that they were throwing their hat in the ring.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 23:27:43'] ARM deal will happen eventually. When it does, NVDA stock price will climb exponentially.If not which I think is unlikely, NVDA will continue on its current trajectory which is still quite impressive. A short term dip could be possible, but won't be disastrous or long lived.Even without ARM, NVDA is in a unique position to enable the adoption of AI in the datacenter, at the edge, and in the field. Over the next several years I see its TAM increasing at a staggering rate. No question the stock costs a premium, but quality is rarely cheap.  Don't miss the ride.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 16:15:27'] I had been assuming that the chances of the acquisition happening were 10% or less. I‚Äôd imagine if/when it falls through it‚Äôll cause a temporary dip, but NVDA still has plenty of growth ahead with or without ARM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:41:23'] It was priced in and then priced out. Where were you in late 2020?ARM deal has been in doubt since it was announced. There was a rally upon the news, but back in late 2020 NVDA tanked from 570 to 470 and people were saying its the ARM uncertainty/dilution of shares being priced in. Since then there has been no positive news around the acquisition, so I strongly doubt any optimism is priced in at this stage. I have only seen negative news around ARM deal since last year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 04:30:06'] If you were living in the UK, you would know by now that ARM will not be acquired by anyone, including Nvidia, Qualcomm or whatever. UK government stated clearly that it will oppose any form of acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 09:39:45'] NVDA shareholders should be very concerned about this acquisition. With the spotlight being turned on to the significance of ARM, I don't believe regulators will be able to  ok the deal especially with Qualcomm stepping up like this. Combine this with a potential slowdown in crypto and you've got a doomsday scenario for Nividia.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 06:14:02'] Does anyone knows what happens if one were to purchase stock after June 21st. Would you just have purchased one really expensive NVDA stock once the split happens.

See link: https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507495/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-date-specsI like FB cuz of its social media platform + Instagram, I think advertising could regain some of its customers after covid eases up, and its endeavors with digital currency could gain traction with the rise of Bitcoin.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 10:06:26'] I write this as someone with knowledge in NVIDIA from an avid consumer point of view, rather than someone who has experience investing in NVDA.  I have never held NVDA. The next big thing from every computer parts manufacturer is ALWAYS rumoured to be the next big thing, this is how marketing works.  By definition, it will be the next mainstream thing as we will adopt the best that is next.  Nvidia are not going to release something which is worse than their last generation.  The 1000 series was strong out the gate.  The 2000 series had a tougher time because it focused on a new type of technology integration into the cards.  RTX.  Users were dissapointed at the low frame rates achieved by even some of the higher cards when using RTX (should have been expected for a new technology).  Ultimately it did deliver Nvidias usual generation increase on raw performance I'd say.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-22 22:06:31'] To answer the first question, I believe that it gets recorded ‚Äúas of June 21‚Äù at end of day (EOD), so if you bought in the morning and held until close it should be recorded. You‚Äôll still own the same dollar value, just more shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 09:38:41'] Every shareholder at the moment the stock splits will get the 4 for 1 split. Each of your 1 shares will turn into 4. The whole "on record" bit is simply a housekeeping measure to state that every share that exists on NVDAs ledger in that date will turn into 4. Even if you bought it after the record date, the shares that were entitled to the person who sold TO YOU were on record.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 01:10:50'] nah the record date is just the entire month in between each other, anyone who sells get their shares transfered
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:01:00'] There is a dividend that you will get for owning before the 21st, and I believe you‚Äôll get 8 shares worth of dividends. People who buy after 21st don‚Äôt get the dividend but still get the split

Just last year Tesla's Model Y became the 4th best selling vehicle in the world, and Tesla is projecting it to become the number one best selling vehicle globally.Despite whatever contraversial things Elon might say it doesn't change the fact that Tesla's leadership has been an unquestionable success for any long term shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 16:27:32'] ARM, Apple, Google, TSMC and Samsung to name a few. The x86 market has shrunk significantly relative to the total market for chips, largely due to phones/tablets. Because Intel hasn't been in those markets, they haven't benefited as greatly from economies of scale in their fab operations, and consequently fell behind.Even in the enterprise server market AWS and others now offer ARM as an option, so there's no clear reason to think the trend away from x86 won't continue and, outside that market, they don't have any moat or real competitive advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 18:49:42'] I think its a little bit of both slowdown and market share loss.AMD is taking market share from Intel for data center CPUs.  But the PC market is experiencing a slowdown.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 18:07:36'] ARM (SoftBank) / TSMC, producing Apple M series processors (30M units/yr)Nvidia / TSMCNvidia / Samsung
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 08:37:01'] There is an overall industry slowdown, although there are multiple markers involved and they are pretty different. The server market, consumer market, and mobile markets are pretty different. AMD is eating Intel's lunch and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future in the server market. That market is slowing down but it's not a major slowdown. In the consumer market Intel is competitive but with lower margins than AMD, this market is slamming into a wall. Intel is not in the mobile market. In terms of the consumer market slowing down you can see that with DRAM manufacturers cutting production. Samsung just recently announced cuts and Micron has been cutting back for months now. Apple, HP, and Lenovo have also been hit pretty hard. Server market is key for AMD and Intel. AMD has the better product at a lower price point right now. AMD and Intel have aggressive roadmaps and AMD has a much better track record, but I wouldn't discount Intel at this point. They are much bigger and have significantly more resources than AMD at this point. Intel is also gearing up to compete with TSMC, not AMD in the future. Their fab build out plan is aimed at gaining business from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. That's something important to consider. Realistically Intel is losing to TSMC, that's where Amazon, Google, and Apple are going. That's the big opportunity for Intel, working with the tech Megacaps.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 15:48:41'] All will have market share.  I personally brought AMD @ $2.50/share because I just believe the industry would not want them to fail.   I sold a bunch over the years and still hold 1000 shares of AMD.   I have been watching INTC to see if it hits $20/share range.  If it does, I will be buying.For me. NVDA is currently over-priced and is a "trendy" stock - good for trading but not investing - the trends have been gaming, crypto and now AI - the cycle goes on.  It peaks than drops - the key is timing which many do not execute effectively.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 16:15:20'] Maybe Nvidia but it can‚Äôt be that much. Intel is not really big in the GPU market which is where Nvidia is mainly involved. They‚Äôre both involved in AI so that can be another.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 21:45:53'] INTC was worried more about paying their dividend than putting $$$ into R&D. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be long before they return to king now that they made the dividend cut. AMD is a perfectly run company too but INTC is probably the better long term play. Especially at the current pricing level of both stonks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 20:31:13'] Everyday Intel is selling some division or the other. Intel sold its main HQ campus as well in San Jose (nearby to my house). The place from where they dominated the world. We have been hiring lot of Intel folk.Intel needs a new leadership.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 22:53:26'] Both AMD and NVDA have good conditions for mid term growth. At least in the next 1 year realistically we will see AMD eat much more into the CPU market for both consumer and server side (EPYC) and compete with NVDA in the mid range GPU departments at the very least, if the RDNA 2 architecture looks as good as it does (Xbox,ps5).NVDA will be booming with mellanox and it's AI architecture component for smart card and honestly the growth outlook for both look solid. You should decide for yourself whether to hold long or short but just don't discount what a giant like INTC might pull out of its arse soon
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 01:02:07'] In a nutshell: Everyone and their grandma uses AMD CPUs. NVDA dominates GPU tho. Intel is much more diversified.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 06:00:11'] NVDA is steady and will continue to dominate the GPU space. But AMD has a great story. Excited to see what they come up with
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 06:52:33'] If you're into semis you really have to own both. they do not overlap really as you claim.  There's some competition in the GPU sector.   Potential wise, AMD has more room. They can steal from both NVDA and INTC so that would be my pick.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 07:49:48'] AMD makes the chips in the PS5 though, right? If the PS5 does well, I'd expect to see some upside from that. Will they do better than NVDA? I don't know, but in the long run, I think both will do well. Probably can't go wrong whichever one you choose.And correct me if I'm wrong, but AMD makes CPUs *and* graphics chips, so it would seem that they have exposure to more markets - NVDA is strictly graphics oriented, right?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:46:06'] I‚Äôd recommend you liquidate right away - then:Keep 10% for investing in companies. Invest in only your top 3 ideas90% put it all in the Vanguard total market index fund (one holding)Over time contribute every month to both funds. Of monthly contributions: 90% monthly to vanguard and 10% to companies fund. Once you‚Äôve read and gained experience and after you‚Äôve been through 1) a big stock boom2) a huge crash/recession3) a period of extreme low volatilityThen you adjust your 90-10 breakdown, put more in stocks. But always invest in just your top 3 ideas. Why put money in your 4th best idea?Best of luckAlso - keep in mind when you read in the news that we‚Äôre ‚Äúofficially‚Äù (not likely or maybe) but officially in a recession - as in have gone through 2 quarters of negative GDP in the past! Then you double or triple contributions monthly. You make your fortune in recessions. 99% of people won‚Äôt have the mental fortitude and gut strength and foresight (keep cash and your job available) to do that. Be that 1% and do the above and you‚Äôll make a fortune in no time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:44:44'] Good job.  I'd toss ARKK and substitute XSD or one of the other semiconductor ETFs.I'd also suggest having one share of XLK and QQQ to just compare your whole portfolio against.  QQQ could be a stand-in for META/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/COST and XLK for AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/AMD.  Longterm it is a good idea to have an industry base ETF (like QQQ and XLK for "tech") and then go heavier with individual stocks.  You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.Obviously you like tech, and so do I.  Having some diversity beyond tech, like KO, is good but don't worry too much about it until you have at least $xx,xxx in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:02:34'] ARKK is junk, imo. She's selling hype. Otherwise you're basically in big tech, plus KO, COST, and VZ. Why did you choose those?I'd imagine you could just buy QQQ and have similar results with less risk. Or just put it all in SPY, since you are basically buying the biggest parts of SPY. Also, VOO has a much lower expense ratio than SPY for essentially the same thing. You might want to review expense ratios.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:30:43'] Those are obviously fine companies.  The only criticism is that most are all very large cap technology companies.  The future growth may or may not be there.  For example AAPL is not going to increase by 32,000% or whatever again.  Same with AMZN.   It‚Äôs mathematically impossible.I‚Äôm a bit closer to retirement and would no doubt be happy with all of these in my portfolio.  Most are thru a large cap fund.   You may want to consider more in SPY or find some growth ETF‚Äôs.  I see ARKK but just hate Cathie she buys some duds.   Anyways, great job keep it up.  Was just commenting to make a point and give you something to think about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:39:36'] ET 10% Div yield vs VZ 6.8%. neither price moves much so I'd go with the higher dividend and I like energy lont term +10yrs. If you can catch ET under $12 I like the buy.You seem big on tech, but I'd consider some rock bottom prices on some innovation company's working toward revenue, small positions in companies with good cash runways nearing the revenue stages. I'm a huge MVIS fan. I think they have the best in class product and based on the recent earning call I think the next 6-12 months sees major progress with OEMs and tier 1 clients.Do what's best for you, and don't blindly take advice on here. Do your research and make sure your comfortable with the risk
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:30:55'] At 19, I would suggest you add dividend paying stocks to your portfolio, growth stocks are okay. But with monthly/quarterly dividends, that you can reinvest into more shares, you have more control and can begin building a passive income that will only keep growing over time
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:34:43'] My advice.  Get rid of all your stocks.  Just stick to your 80/20 VTI/ VXUS.  Invest each month into whatever is lagging to keep it 80/20 each month FOREVER.  That's it.  Then focus on what is more important to be rich.... Your education, job, income, savings, and LBYM.  Below is a link from JPM own private wealth arm concluding after looking at last 35 years of all individual stock returns they can't even suggest adding a concentrated portfolio to their OWN clients!  https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:27:22'] Not very diversified, is it? Not any criticism, but I would more diversify. Have you thought about some ETF's so spread is bigger? I just see a lot of tech and mainstream stocks!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:33:58'] TSLA & ARKK\- TSLY follows TSLA plus it provides monthly div\- OARK tracks ARKK ETF and has monthly div.If TSLA and ARKK turn south you still have div income, if they head north div is more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:21:08'] It's a lot of holdings. Large caps too. First, throw away ARKK, seriously. Then put whatever you want to keep low-risk in SPY, BRKB, VOO, VXUS or VTI, and try to add some risk to your portfolio. You're 19, find a company you like, understand (maybe in the field you're studying or working in today) and think is promising, then put some money you're willing to lose in it. Sell some covered calls for income if you like.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:56:03'] What you are doing is create your own ETF. There is nothing wrong with this strategy as long as you focus on those stocks and don‚Äôt expand them into a hundred, then you end up with a lot of little. Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it‚Äôs not a good thing, you don‚Äôt need dividends, you need growth. Also if you like a particular sector, get ETFs, and don‚Äôt shy away for an S&P ETF, or small caps, historically they have done well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 01:04:38'] Congratulations to you - I wish I had done this when I was 19!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 09:38:07'] I‚Äôve only invested in 4 stocks in 14 years amd Tsla googl and aapl. Sold one of them 2 years back (amd) and hold and invest in only 3 now.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.\n\nFree cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.\n\nThis led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA).\n\nThis led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.\n\nWhat do you guys think?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:29:54'] From an Accounting perspective, stock based comp is excluded from Cash Flow (added back to Net Income because it is a non-cash expense that reduced Net Income, to get to Operating Cash Flow).From an Investing perspective, stock based comp should be subtracted (from Cash Flow) to get to Free Cash Flow, because that compensation would have required cash payment if it weren‚Äôt being paid thru dilution of shareholders ownership.Depreciation is non-cash, but your analysis already contemplates cap-ex, so no need to subtract it to arrive at Free Cash Flow.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 22:31:56'] Subtract from cash flow because while it is a non-cash, it dilutes shareholders and is therefore a 'real' cost

Any one of these stocks can jump 10-20% a day, but also go down just as much. If you‚Äôre basing off the innovations, a proven track record, steady cash flows, and potential for growth I would go with NVDA personally. Keep in mind that the semiconductor sector is gradually making a change towards AI and autonomous vehicles and it looks like NVDA has the slight edge in that. Be ready for a wild ride tho. 
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-30 21:28:00'] Buy companies because they have fantastic leadership, a solid product roadmap / moat and can back it up.  I like AMD because they are only ever one of 2 x86 vendors. Anyone could make hardware to compete where nvidia makes its money. Google / amazon are doing exactly that with dedicated ml hardware. Add on AMD and Intel to competing with nvidia as well, and you realize that nvidia is trying to find new markets like crazy (autonomous vehicles, heavy competition). This is Going to increase costs for research and development.  Nvidia has a lead in their highly competitive market. But AMD has a big ass moat in one of their markets and a game changing produce line (ryzen).  As well as being a solid second in Nvidias market.

	COMMENT: ['2019-01-30 20:58:01'] AMD, Lisa Su is amazing, she has turned AMD around and is chipping away at Intel
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-30 21:03:49'] AMD looks better. They have much more potential and a bit more risk but the fact that they have solid cpus now makes it a no brainer.
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-30 20:50:42'] AMD! No brainer. I bought both NVDA & AMD back in 2016 when they were trading at ~30 & $3.5 respectively. Based off my research by later that year I sold all the other tech stocks Including NVDA and bought loads of AMD. Well i didnot time the market correctly as NVDA went parabolic while AMD remain stagnant until mid 2018 but it eventually paid off. Gains from AMD are way more than NVDA % wise. AMD from here ca easily double or triple in span of 2-3 years. Lisa is guiding around 50% growth in H2 and that is without the revenues from next generation consoles.I think NVDA is done for the year at least. They made bad bet on Turing, didnt account for crypto burst (AMD managed that well plus they have  diversified portfolio) plus their datacenter market is under threat from lots of players like Intel, Xilinx, AMD, Google etc. Autonomous driving remains pretty flat. Gaming is slowing down and that is without any high end competitive GPU from AMD. Intel is also developing GPU. Assuming if they are able to make competitive GPU (highly likely) lower discrete graphics will pretty much be dead as DDR-5 become mainstream in APUs.

	COMMENT: ['2019-01-31 03:27:13'] Neither.   The industry is fundamentally changing.The largest four companies in the world, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple ALL use to not design their own chips.  Now all four do their own chips.    Microsoft it is FPGA but still their own.   You will see this more and more.It is interesting because it is a lot more like how it use to be a long time ago in tech.  Where the big companies did their own chips.   Companies like DEC and IBM for example.  We are going back to this approach.    We are quickly.Once something is moving in a direction there has to be some catalyst to change the trend.   I do not see anything that would change the current trend.
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-30 22:55:32'] Absolutely AMD. They're crushing so many markets with Ryzen and Epyc CPUs. And also that they're making a lineup of graphics cards (NAVI) that are supposed to have the proformance of Nvidia cards for a MUCH lesser price. For example it's rumoured that their 250 card is supposed to have the performance of Nvidias $600ish card (RTX 2070). And Ray Tracing isn't in enough games yet to justify the RTX aspect of it. So in short, amd has just been getting better and better since ryzen came out and I think it's going to stay that way for a while. Especially with the fact that they can actually manufacture the 7nm chip.

	COMMENT: ['2019-01-31 05:25:48'] I have some in both, and that AMD rally was moist, at least cancelled out my Nvidia losses. However, AMD is the higher risk, higher reward stock, and to me 100K is a lot of money, so if I HAD to pick one, I'd go Nvidia for their more steady plod upwards over time. AMD could go big, or I could be left with half of that, Nvidia's P/E is still a bit high but not really a concern that it would vaporize too much capital overnight. If you lifted the constraints a bit, I'd do 40/60 AMD/Nvidia.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 02:07:14'] Some thoughts: 1. I like to use index funds as core positions in my accounts. I use those to preserve gains by moving funds from swing trade positions into those. 2. Before doing *anything*, the first question is, ‚Äúwhat is the best use of that capital?‚Äù Do you expect the positions to underperform the market by enough to justify eating the long term cap gains hit? Would you be more bothered by being wrong moving the funds before another run up, or failing to move the funds before a drop? My personal yardstick is this: if profits beat about 15% annualized rate of return after the long term cap gains hit, I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôll never be mad at a position beating the market average. Your views may differ.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:35:01'] I would think of what you plan is to do with said profits. Having said that, it seems some of these companies may have some froth and would explain your profit....having said thatttt, I would figure out which companies are frothy, dump the whole position and then reinvest elsewhere. That's if you really want to take profit. Otherwise, just hold. You gotta have an exit strategy before you invest... An exit for profits, an exit for stop loss, etc. And exit strategy is just as important as the initial investment. Sometimes an exit strategy is hold forever because you have done your dd and truly believe the company will continue to grow and give great returns
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 10:43:43'] If you really want to take profits, then just sell off enough to get your initial investment back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:20:40'] This isn't financial advice and I'm no financial advisor.  Ask yourself how you would feel if your money stayed in there 3 more years and it all went up a good chunk even further.Compare that to if you lose all the gains. Time goes by and they quickly drop back to your cost basis,  0% gains, back to where you bought it at.Would you be furious at yourself for not having sold and securing the gains? or no big deal?Also, would you leave it in if it went back to where you started? Ask those questions.  What do I find unacceptable? What is a worthwhile risk?  You'll get a better sense of what your gut tells you to do and what level of risk tolerance you have.

	COMMENT: ['2019-01-22 14:09:23'] Why did this get gold
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-22 15:13:25'] Ive just been researching NVDA this morning so I have an updated idea. Their growth is expected to slow down for the next couple years so the recent drop was justified. With a decrease in earnings growth you should expect wall street to give a decreased valuation which is what we have seen with the earnings multiple dropping to about 20. With the current growth forecast I dont see this as a bargain, but rather a fairly priced company if not overvalued. The reason you saw NVDA run so well the past 5 years was due to averaging about 40% yoy growth, and since growth is expected to diminish the P/E came down to reflect that.When the company's past performance was similar to its current projection we consistently saw a valuation of about 15 P/E. If we see this reversion to the mean once again then NVDA is overvalued still and you should expect this stock to underperform. From my point of view I would stay clear of this stock at its current price.

	COMMENT: ['2019-10-15 12:55:40'] I would be skeptical,First let‚Äôs look a little at the current Turing architecture on the market. Turing is Nvidia‚Äôs current architecture, and by all means it is a good architecture. However there are two notable flaws with it. Raytracing and tensor cores. Raytracing and the fix function hardware associated with it (here by referred to as RT cores) was a very poor implementation of raytracing as it attempted to combined it with rasterization meaning that it is path-tracing and not raytracing. The issue with this is that there are currently not enough RT cores to perform the calculations for pathtracing, meaning that the shader unites are bottlenecked by the RT cores so we observe a massive decrease in performance. With the next launch of Nvidia cards (not the refreshes), I would guess there would be at least a doubling in RT cores, however the primary issue with this is that their implementation of raytracing will be obsolete because of consoles. The next generation of consoles which are powered by an AMD apu will have raytracing, however the hardware will not be fix function, furthermore, it will be an open standard similar to DX12 meaning that vastly more games will be able to easily implement raytracing. This is a major issue with Nvidia because their hardware will not be as well optimized for these games, meaning lower performance. Furthermore, because they touted raytracing as their new schtick they cannot remove it the following generation as that would be admiring defeat, causing backlash in stock prices. Tensor cores for the most part are never used unless upsampling or for very specific rendering tasks, so on consumer GPUs, they are never used. These two factors have lead to Nvidia having enormous die areas, for example, the 2070 super has a die area in excess of 520mm2. When we compare this to what the die are of AMD‚Äôs Navi GPUs, we see that they are a little less that half the size at roughly 250mm2, this means that even taking into account the node shrink, the Navi GPUs are roughly 30% smaller. Smaller die sizes are much cheaper as yield are better, meaning that they can have a larger profit margin at a lower price. Furthermore, Nvidia dig themselves into an even deeper hole with the ludicrous 1200$ MSRP of the 2080ti. This astronomical price lets AMD scale their GPUs up to 650mm2, handily beating Nvidia, and even put on HBM2E memory to add more efficiency and more bandwidth becomes a possibility. Nvidia‚Äôs compute cards are not looking good either because they are so expensive that companies are starting to simply make their own ASICs (ei: Tesla) or turning to AMD with their Vega solutions. Vega is a very good computer card, and with not getting into too much detail about how the architecture works, we could see a Vega card with 128 compute unites, twice as much are Vega frontier cards.AMD is not Nvidia‚Äôs biggest threat though. Intel is. Currently intel is getting dominated in the CPU space, and will not make a proper recovery until earliest 2021 (with current timelines and leaks). However, they recently spent 18b on consumer GPUs. To give some context, Turing costed roughly a billion over the course of 5 years. Intel just spent 18x that amount and they have some very smart people, meaning that their GPUs will be monsters in terms of efficiency. Not too many details are known about the Intel SKUs, however when we look at some of their earlier APUs, we see that even when Intel was not focusing on GPUs, they made incredible chips as seen in Ivy-bridge.That's just my two cents of what we could see with NVIDIA, I simplified a lot of aspects of their architecture and what Intel and AMD have.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 11:04:12'] Admittedly the language around timing is confusing, but one thing you can be certain of is that if you paid the pre-split price, your shares will split, and if you paid the post-split price, the split has already been accounted for. No one's money just disappears.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 11:29:29'] July 1st is dividend pay date. If bought after June 21st, you only get the dividend of the shares you purchased. If bought before, you get the dividend for the additional 3 shares as well. Thats my understanding. The split happens on June 21st, but wont take affect until mid-July. This makes it easier for accounting. You'll still get the additional shares, but not the additional dividend. Not a huge deal as its pennies compared to the share cost.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 12:10:24'] in theory, as long as you're buying through reputable brokerages, the shares will follow you as if you had owned prior to the split date.source: got EXPI shares after the ex date but before the split, and still got had my shares double on the split date.

Buy 1 piece now, and wait and see for maybe 2 week before the next piece and so on.I'm assuming you can afford the risk implied - but don't let pricing force you from buying a good company at a meh price to a meh company at a low price, IMO. People called tesla overvalued in 2017, but if you had vision and you understood their technological progress you made a killing. The people who sat around complaining about P/E just moved on to another thing to complain about - they will sound smart and they won't lose money, but they also aren't making any and risk missing generational wealth.Develop your own strategy and perspective and have conviction.

The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful\n2. Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-26 15:22:17'] I dont understand why cyclical stocks should have such substantial market capitalization swings during their cycles.  The cyclical nature is already reflected in the PE multiple, and cyclicality should be priced in at all times.  Why should the price of the stock itself fluctuate when things move within a known and understood cycle?  Stupid priced in optimism that the cycle is done?  I dont get it.  &#x200B;MU's balance sheet supports like $25/share of its price, the fact that all of its future growth potential is discounted to fucking nothing is crazy to me.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-26 16:20:34'] I think mu is nearing a bottom. I noticed a strange divergence between hynix and mu lately where hynix has performed much better. Mu is getting close to book value so the downside is starting to get limited even if its a cyclical business.Bought some shares at 34.5. Still more possible downside but have lots of dry powder to buy more if needed. I feel bad for those who bought mu at 60. Never listen to pumper analysts. When everyone says buy like with amd and mu the ride is almost over. Same thing for when all the analysts are telling you to sell. Im not saying the downside is over by any means but its not a bad time to build a small position for mu, amd and nvda.

The Dojo tiles are designed for their own use case; training their FSD stack. For their purposes, it's better than the NVDA A100 GPUs they've been using, but they aren't planning on selling these.

However, the problem with these "backward looking" assessments comparing two different companies is that we don\'t really know the future, and can\'t therefore make predictions based on the past (duh). For example, Wall Street tried to val'

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-25 03:33:45'] Couple of points: 1. Your argument of low latency = SoC = ARM superior doesn't make sense to me. Having an SoC for lower latency purposes is just as possible on x86 - for instance, AMD recently announced an ability for clients to connect their own chip designs directly to the Infinity Fabric die, achieving super low latency, while not having to redesign the rest of the CPU side.2. Can you explain more clearly why you think NVDA is better positioned than INTC or AMD, or anyone else to profit from a possible shift to ARM? You make a lot of good points in the paragraphs prior then just jump to 'nvda will benefit from these' without explaining why.Personally, my view is that x86 will continue to dominate the server/HPC side, while 'mobile' - or even non-mobile, consumer devices (think consoles) will shift to ARM and get their data from the HPC. Outside of a few extremely niche use cases in HPC (which, again, I don't see yours as one of from what you've described), x86's inherent advantages over ARM suggests to me any replacement isn't going to happen anytime soon.

POST_TEXT: b"First off, we all love NVDA and it's an amazing meme stock.  A lot of us have made countless amounts of money off of these guys.  But for Q2 earnings they're fucked.\n\n1: Take a look at these [GPU price graphs](https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/).  The trend is a huge peak and slow fall, but all of this happened before Q1 earnings, meaning their large beat in may was heavily influenced by this.  Since the beginning of february GPU prices are 30% lower.  Due to the law of supply and demand, this means that the supply was too high and the demand fell - meaning NVDA lost money on a lot of these cards.  A price drop at this scale means a large excess of inventory - i'll get to that later.\n\n2: Cryptocurrency fad is dead for the time being.  The following is a quote from their CFO about cryptocurrency (which NVDA does not like to talk about):\n> Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected, but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto-specific GPUs, which are in"

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-12 23:13:47'] I‚Äôm starting to feel a little crazy here and I havnt actually spent the time to go back and confirm this, but a while ago I saw a breakdown of their revenue streams and crypto was something like 5% of total. Maybe this has changed or I‚Äôm just remembering incorrectly but I see a lot of stuff on this sub talking about how crypto will make or break their business which seems funny if it really is such a small fraction of their revenue. *i know you referenced more than just cryptoEdit: regardless you make good points and I‚Äôll be considering some stop orders soon. Your points combined with the slight potential for them to get wrapped up in this China trade shit seems like it could be a bummer in the making

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-12 22:31:41'] What about new GPU's that are due to release?
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 00:59:03'] Crypto contribution to their revenue is 9% from what I remember. Crypto is volatile as they have said on calls before.Also huge factor determine post earnings move is the extent to which revenues/earnings are priced in.  If you have uncovered these things (falling GPU prices, Gigabyte revenues etc) its probable that many of the sell-side analysts looking at NVDA have also noticed that as well and adjusted their estimates.All in all, good points though. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-12 22:02:08'] Get out of here with your logic.
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 04:06:11'] I have also been watching GPU prices come down and it may be that NVDA will take a big hit when earnings come out.  If the stock goes down, I believe it will be a buying opportunity since gaming demand is massive and will only grow as prices come down.  Datacenter revenue should continue to grow and a tech refresh is coming that should help maintain margins.  I am staying long but may trim a call to lock in some profit.   
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 04:24:53'] When is earmings?
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 06:50:26'] Agreed. Don't have too much time right now but pretty much agree with your points and have been following up on the same issues/trends.  There were even more reports out of Taiwan that corroborate lower GPU demand during last two months.Re: Crypto Rig decline was already provided in their guidance so it should literally have no impact on earnings vs expectations.  If anything, it could be a (very) small benefit since when lowering guidance companies tend to be more conservative.Overall, I think you are right though.  Holding on to my shares since I am still bullish long term, but would be careful timing options around earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 06:58:12'] Comment to save page to write here again when OP is wrong and NVDA has a great quarter anyway. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-07-13 09:34:52'] 1. I already made my comment, that only the retailers make more money with the increase in MSRP price.  so right there your analysis is broke.2.  Can't comment, but obviously slow sales will impact...its not like they just stopped all sales.  When a new card comes out and it is faster than the 1080ti mining may pick up slightly. Although Cyrto seems to be changing, it won't be as crazy as it was.3.  Gigabytes other months were up YOY.  They are also up 25&#37; YOY. They also dropped negative for the month in February, -4&#37;.  Also, how much of that is GPU related not their other segments?  It could be worse...  Again, obviously sales will drop imo, it is unsustainable.  We will see how next months drop is as well. 4. I would also add the 300k gpu return is beyond strange....I mean how would a company miss step with that much of a messed up order and how do they get to return them?  I am not saying it is false, but why would just ONE AIB company do it?  something is up with this one. Maybe all OEM returned 300k but I still don't see why unless they were told to start working on a new card for the new GPU.  Pascal still sells well....if prices drop they will continue to sell.  So many people want to upgrade and not many people have a 1070 or greater GPU....percentage wise 70&#37;+(estimate) would be upgrading if they got a 1070.  Those numbers favor nvidia.IMO Nvidia is just milking pascal, slowing down advancement, sadly. I think this helps them financially, although I loathe it as a gamer.  Basically still making money on a product that should have been replaced already...for the gamer segment.  IMO their focus has been to increase revenue in other areas and that is where the majority of their work has been going(data, AI, Cars(which is still very small).  Although, PC gaming continues to increase and gaming is now the biggest form of entertainment...it will only continue and the backbone of gaming is GPUs.Some reasonable points, but WAY too extreme.  It is clear what you want to happen, imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 11:51:51'] Get them something relevant to their lives, and that pays a dividend. Assuming this isn't a full blown portfolio geared to paying for college or whatever, and more just introducing them to the concepts of investing. It's much easier for kids to grasp the idea of getting paid to own parts of companies. And they can see tangible, albeit small, returns quarter over quarter, which will help reinforce the idea of long term compounding. Focusing on pure growth may be a great way to discourage them as they enter this potential recession and see constant declines QoQ, YoY. As they mature, they can explore ideas of growth, reading income statements, sector analysis, small cap vs large cap, foreign and emerging markets, and everything that goes with that. But start with the absolute bare basics and build from there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 12:43:04'] I would let them pick some. Kids are intuitive and they know what they like. If they like a company, chances are they understand (at a beautifully simple level) what‚Äôs great about the company. For instance, MCD, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tasty and the happy meal has a toy!‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 11:51:10'] If investing in their favorite hobby stocks doesnt motivate them, try to find stocks that give out free stuff annually. Dont know if any of them do it anymore, but I use to have Wrigley stock when I was a wee tyke. Every Xmas, Id get a big box of free gum that took me a year to finish. That was pretty cool for a little kid imo.Some good hobby stocks are videogame makers (check to see they arent scumbags first *cough*atvi*cough*), sports apparel, toymakers, favorite junk food, Space related,  etc. All will need DD before jumping in, but I'm sure you can find a few that spark some interest.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 17:13:42'] A regular dividend is sure to spark investing interest in adults at least so I guess it could do the same for kids.Even if the total return is lower a dividend-paying stock may make it psychologically easier to hold a stock long-term while making it more fun.But if they are kids maybe introduce them to games with compounding to try to get them to fully understand the power of reinvesting. Here's a [list of some games.](https://chooseinvesting.com/blog/investing-games-list/)It doesn't necessarily have to be about investing but just that you can compound anything.Since when they get introduced to stocks/indexing they may actually understand what compounding can do for them. And if the only compounding they do are in stocks/investing it may be too boring and they won't know what compounding actually can do.And when the time comes for investing in stocks they may know how op it is, just as it is in those games they used to play.This isn't any advice just suggestions, I have no teaching kids experience.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 12:32:20'] Prob an unpopular opinion, but maybe let your kids grow up before they get into the *riveting* world of stocks and finance in general.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 18:08:00'] None.  Sorry, but the WORST thing is making investing fun.  Investing should be like paying for your mortgage.  Something you do every month because it is a responsibility.  Nothing you feel strongly about either way.  Then 30 years later you realize you get a whole bunch of adv. from having that equity in the house.Making investing fun makes it feel like a game.  That is how you have the culture of these Reddit forums and why so many TBH SUCK at investing and end up poor in their 50-60's.  If you have read the Tortoise and the Hare investing is akin to being the Tortoise.  NO ONE wants to be the tortoise, but that is what you want to be....Focus on:  Saving, LBYM, not being materialistic, not caring what others have/ wearing, working hard to buy stuff on your own, getting a great education.  Then when they are older... index investing EACH and every month in an asset allocation that makes sense to them.  They LITERALLY don't even need to understand anything about what a stock even mean to be worth millions in their 50's if they just do the above.  Or they could do LOVE stocks and be poor in their 50's.  Funny how that works.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 13:27:49'] You want kids to be interested in stocks, you should pick a meme stock. Not necessarily to trade in, but observe how social media, financial media, mix of questionable and solid company turnaround plans all intersect. I count bank stocks as meme stocks too now.

For example, a kid who loved Harry Potter might want to buy Scholastic Corporation (SCHL) which has the US publishing rights. An athletic kid might want to buy NKE or DKS. WWE is publicly traded if they‚Äôre into that. Hasbro (HAS) might be worth a look depending on interests.Also think about their favorite foods & drinks. Coca Cola (KO) and YUM could make sense for fans of their products.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:47:29'] Peter Lynch writes about kids getting interested in stocks in One Up on Wall Street, one of his two books from the 1990sHis advice is to start with stocks for companies the kids are familiar with and they already like the product or service. e.g., Supermarkets where the family buys food; car companies that make the family's vehicles or oil company stocks if they're familiar with the Exxon or Chevron station; companies that make their favorite clothes, shoes, toys or electronic gadgets; restaurants or fast food companies they enjoy; entertainment company stocks like maybe Disney or Netflix; today maybe social media companies...from there, teach them how to analyze fundamentals on a basic level. he recommends companies that are reasonably valued, low-debt for their type, and profitable. Dividends are a plus but not necessary for every stock or company. then, pick a handful of stocks from different sectors and go from there.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 05:52:33'] The choice is clear in my opinion. A stock for kids. Preferably a company with positive cash flow, no debt, more than a billion cash on hand and first signs of a successful turnaround for a long and prosper future. Gamestop fits perfectly. Just set up an automatic investment plan on Computershare for the kids and here we go!

POST_TEXT: b"Hi all, I was a semi-early investor with Nvidia Corp. and bought their stick around 90$ per share. I sold when it hit 350$ (around 2017 I think) and I know I shot myself in the foot because it now sits around 550$. I did see it get to 650ish at a peak, right around the beginning of US quarantine. It is dropping again and am wondering (more likely waiting for someone to co-sign my bullshit) if other people this that their value will rise again, I know their GPU's are very popular and I even own one. I guess my discussion is, do any of you see Nvidia climbing the ladder again?"

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 14:54:29'] Here's how you do it:1)Figure out an intrinsic value for each company. At least an estimate. 2)Subtract a margin of safety. 3) buy when it's below that number. 4) wait. Otherwise, just DCA into an index and forget it.Also, why would you buy a stock just to watch it move?

Buy and DCA into good businesses. If you don't like volatility, buy index funds.Hold them, then repeat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 14:23:08'] Firstly, Tesla is definitely overvalued. Don't buy it at this price.As for semi stocks, here's my thoughts. Nvidia is also overvalued. Even the company believes that their stock is expensive, as seen by their recent attempt to raise $10 billion in funding. Although Nvidia certainly has a bright future in terms of growth the stock is significantly expensive even when accounting for that growth, which is the major problem.  AMD in comparison is the best firm I am aware of at a fair price, so it's a good name to DCA into at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 14:26:14'] If you‚Äôre concerned I‚Äôd go 30% growth and large cap funds, and 70% money market
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 21:10:07'] To do a precise estimate is impossible and even educated financial advisors, funds or banks do not have a better performance than random picking.If you want to minimize your money loss, learn about macroeconomic situation and cycles first, to understand the fundamentals of the markets, human emotions (charts) and economy.After you will understand how various sectors behave in various stages of the economic cycle, you can do a bit better picks and lower the risk. After that, not before, you will do the specific analysis of a specific stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 13:31:06'] If you‚Äôre asking if you can buy all ofthese stocks at a cheaper price than they trade at today in the coming months, the answer is very likely yes.  No one can predict a crash, however it would seem to me that the speculative bubble kicked off by COVID two years ago has yet to truly pop.  The rate hikes of 2022 have yet to be fully realized in valuations of equities.  And there are more hikes coming throughout this year.   Inflation has not been tamed sufficiently, and unemployment is still at record lows.  It‚Äôs going to almost certainly serve your financial interest best to be patient and DCA (dollar cost average) into any equity position you are interested in.  This is especially true  if you are of a buy and hold mentality and not ‚Äútrading‚Äù these stocks.  Set buy in levels and percentages and wait.  It‚Äôs not very fun or exciting, but perfectly timing a bottom for 100% of your position is not going to be possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 15:16:55'] TBH, I think you need to define a strategy/sense of direction. I like to think in terms of possibility (rather than prediction) and ask, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the risk?‚Äù So‚Ä¶ based on where the market stands right now, we‚Äôre positioned such that we could see a rip up if we get good macro news, we could get kicked in the nuts again, or we could stay rangebound. People argue passionately about that, and I‚Äôm happy to leave the prediction debates to them. What matters to me is the range of possibilities. I lay that out to explain that it can be useful to zoom out and ask, ‚Äúwhat do I want to be holding if the market rips/tanks/trades sideways from here?‚Äù Some people answer with a barbell, some with diversification, some with options to define outcome range, etc. There are a lot of ways to approach it. Rather than offering specific buy/sell or construction advice, I think the best suggestion is to work through the question of what you want to be holding through sunshine and rain, or to consider your strategy around downside. Since you have a heavy cash position, there‚Äôs also a question of what your strategy is around deployment of cash if the market rips. Cash adds drag against either direction, so you want to figure out what your plan is for that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 18:12:59'] Your portfolio is definitely overweight on large cap growth and tech stocks. Its a strategy that vastly outperformed the market from 2009-2021.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:12:40'] Wow. I always thought 7 was a good number for a picker. Currently I got 5. So I'd say you're not too concentrated. But maybe that's just me.

You can either continue dca into it if you think it‚Äôs now cheap or start buying other sectors to diversify from tech. If you‚Äôre young it‚Äôs definitely not concentrated, that‚Äôs pretty close to beta, if you‚Äôre old I would definitely diversify by using the cash to buy uncorrelated assets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 06:18:01'] Do you know how to value companies or how to read a 10k? If the answer is no then I would be 90% in indices/ETFs (at least).

So anything PE's or other analysis will be look better than it should. The profit margins have been improving, but now everyone is complaining the prices are too high.For AI and ML everything I read says ASICs and TPUs are multiple times better than GPUs. And at the scale these things will be needed they will be going for the best efficiency. Google, the biggest player, is making their own TPUs. NVDA does have a nice sized dedicated R&D budget. I'm not sure how easy or hard it is for other players to create their own stuff. And semiconductors by themselves are a difficult industry.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 22:17:50'] you are better off buying other stocks. Here is why: I don't think we have seen the bottom of the crypto downhill. One bad news on that side and NVDA stock will go down even further. Secondly, aside from gaming, nvidia is not really in the forefront of anything (ill be glad if someone can give me a link saying otherwise). Just look at its 6month 1yr trend, 5yr trend; It doesn't look that good. Now there are news of the board buying back stock and you could make money off of that. The question now is whether you want to risk buying it at 170 or buy it when its around the lower 160. If I were you I would wait until it goes down a bit (second wave of sellers) and buy it before it reach$178-$180. Good luck mate
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:09:40'] It's not low my friend
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:20:49'] I would not buy it here. It will become a trade at some point. Some guys are sitting on like a 20$ move on a stock that just reported a terrible quarter and bad guidance. Theyre going to rake that profit. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:48:27'] Back in 2015, when I turned 18, I opened a brokerage account and bought NVDA at $17. A few months later I sold $30.Buy and hold, man. Buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 22:34:36'] With regards to NVDA and growth in Automotive:  TSLA turned them down, and Ford and GM have just announced huge cuts.  It leaves me thinking that the auto sector isn't going to be a big play for NVDA at least in the next few quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-08 07:10:23'] I remember people having this exact discussion about Apple when it crashed in the dotcom bubble. Everyone was saying the end is here in 2007 summer during the crash then. And low and behold, the iPhone comes out and the stock destroys the market for a 10 year sprint.  Nvidia is in that 2007 summer right now. The trend is AI, autonomous driving. There is no competition worthy of the infrastructure and brand that nvidia has, much like Apple right before the smartphone boom. It really is so simple and no need to overcomplicate things - Nvidia open sourced it's artificial intelligence so that no one else can muscle into the market they are building. They ARE the market. Deep learning, AI, image processing, server accelaration.... all of it is Nvidia. AMD will be growing too, but I prefer owning market leaders.  Just stop looking at the monthly stock moves. In 2025 you will be filthy rich.  
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 14:55:41'] They have a future in Deep Learning which I am exited about.   Not sure about being a good buy right now though. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 23:24:35'] Have you asked this 10 days earlier, the consensus had been that it's heading to $80. :)For the record, I'm holding it even though I'm deep in red.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:24:38'] Nothing is a good buy right now. It's all going down.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:41:42'] Why didnt you buy at 140
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 21:45:50'] I wouldn't get it if you're looking to make a quick buck.  I don't see it getting near it's highs until they report a few quarters of great earnings, and I don't see that happening until something changes. They're not releasing new products until they sell their current stock and all the uncertainty isn't going to help drive the price up either.  If you're trying for long term though, I think they are poised to be a big player in the future and that's why you're still paying a premium for their shares, although a cheaper one at the moment.  I'm buying for the future, 5, 10, 20 years down the road, and in that aspect I think NVDA is a great buy right now.  
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 22:30:50'] im still holding my shares at -$300 lol id say its a good time to invest especially since RTX just got a HUGE update that made it 50% better in BFV which is really good news. edit: wanted to add: tbh AMD is probably the better buy rn with how amazing the cpus are doing but nvda is solid as well. AMD also tends to follow NVDA most of the time even though it seems to be breaking away from that.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 22:55:24'] Might have been back when it was $130 10 days ago. At $170, the risk/reward is too high
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-03 23:26:02'] why not sell covered calls in the stock, probably still some good IV in the stock yea?&#x200B;
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-04 04:49:26'] Bit worried about Nvidia long term and how more and more the big boys creating their own chips.    Google with the TPUs but there is more and more seem to be doing the same.Seems to be the trend that do not think will change.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-04 21:44:24'] waiting for 120s to get back in edit-more importantly how they report next quarter and future guidance. if it turns out bad it can go much lower
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-05 13:24:34'] I am keen than crypto will be back up again in the mid to end of 2019 so I am considering an investment, but that is just my personal opinion since crypto is a large factor of their market 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-06 23:50:59'] it's obvious that NVDA is still overvalued lol. look at these naive folks.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-04 00:48:21'] No, and only because AMD is absolutely killing it right now, about to roll out thier 7nm architecture in CPUs and improve GPU 7nm architecture. Im not saying these two companies are a zero sum game (Intel kind of is) but I'd probably rather buy AMD right now. How AI and IoT will affect the chip industry remains to be seen, but for now thier consumer grade hardware makes up a large portion of profits. Nvidia is still miles ahead of AMD GPU's as of right now but Intel was on that pedastal just a few years ago, and we've all seen how fast that status quo can change. And thier gamble on Ray Tracing (rtx) dosen't seem to be something mainstream consumers will catch on.On a side note, I don't know much about AI but it dosen't seem like GPU parallel processing is super useful in applications that require alot of flexibility, something that AI tech needs. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-04 07:10:29'] AMD is next to release their cards, most likely they will go neck and neck with nvidia last gen cards but at a better price. I expect nvidia to take another dip then and go up right after when they drop prices in their current gen cards

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 08:07:07'] Can we just take a moment, away from the bull/bear hate posting, to feel how nice this rally has been, makes the dark red times much easier to stomach when they inevitably come back at whatever point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 13:05:07'] My indicator for the market turning around is that I'm getting "here's my trick for making thousands of dollars a day in the stock market" on tiktok and youtube shorts again. Hadn't seen one of those in months and in the last couple weeks they're back in droves

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 10:03:10'] Torn between holding Google and AMD through earnings and the FOMC for a longer swing trade or selling for a 15% return on my account short term today. All shares, thoughts?&#x200B;DXY is down but seems to have found support until BOJ acts again or something else occurs. China reopening is bullish for AMD demand. AMD and Google will have forex tailwinds for earnings. Though I'm worried about how retail sales/the consumer have been looking in data for the Q. Neither is pound the table cheap here but they aren't overvalued either.&#x200B;Edit: Decided to sell some google for a trade to build some cash, keeping AMD through earnings season/FOMC

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 08:06:50'] Bears absolutely ethered again. Time and time again bears will come in here and spew hatred against bulls as if they were stupid for accumulating at a time like this. Yet time and time again they get proven wrong. Soft landing was absolutely spot on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 11:07:08'] I can see the cracks forming in the "recession for sure trust me bro" narrative. Even a few news bits to support the claim. Nice to feel vindicated from 2022 downvoted comments üòé
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 08:31:43'] Really think Fed is just gonna sit and watch the market skyrocket like this and come out dovish at FOMC? While PCE inflation is still double their target range and unemployment at all time lows? Think it's more likely Powell rides out on stage on the back of a unicorn
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 08:55:25'] Kinda worried about this rally - If oil remained in the low $70's range, I would be more confident about this rally...But, it has gone up nearly every day to now being above $82, and low energy prices have been one of the key things bringing down inflation reads. Even though some of this is because of China's reopening, there is no doubt that stock market rallies tend to raise the value of oil, as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 16:31:17'] Casual Hypothesis I haven't put too much thought into. Interested in opinions:The weakening big tech labor market means that a surplus of software engineering talent will now be more accessible to non-tech businesses that desperately need more tech investment. Examples: airlines (SouthWest after this month's fiasco), big banks (who need to do what the new fintech kids on the block are doing), healthcare, ...To focus in on fintech, I always didn't really like the space because a lot of the bull cases relied on the company being a 'one stop shop' or having a 'nice app interface'  or 'innovative machine learning algorithms' which are certainly things the cash-flush big banks can do if they choose to make the investment in it. If banks are able to step up their spending on tech investments, I think this presents a major bear case for the various fintech companies that rode the 2021 craze. Not to mention the huge amount of competition. Upstart, Affirm, SOFI, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Stripe, Square, Klarna, Intuit, Visa, Mastercard, Finastra, PaySafe ... [I'll be honest I couldn't list all the fine details about most of these, but they all appear to provide services banks can do]

"Obesity costs the US health care system nearly $173 billion a year."

The tech is already there, but the biggest hurdle is legislation to allow it to happen.  They are planning for significantly lower vehicle volumes, but shifting to becoming subscription based organizations at higher profit margins than being a manufacturer.  Will it happen, yes, but might be a while.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 08:31:45'] The tech is difficult but liability will also be immensely difficult to regulate.If we have truly autonomous vehicles it means we don't need driver licenses anymore since the car has no drivers. Everyone is a passanger so all the liability has to be on the manufacturer including accidents and also traffic tickets. The only thing I should pay as a car owner is comprehensive coverage.I just don't see that transformation happening anytime soon. It is more likely that we will get fleet of autonomous cars that are used by companies like Uber.

So Google and Tesla seem good starting points. The only place I wouldn‚Äôt look is the current car manufacturers. They keep buying promising startups and shutting them down because self driving would really kill the need for us to all own a car (or two) that statistically sits idle 95% of the time (yes, that‚Äôs a real stat).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 07:45:46'] The computers in cars need to be more efficient first. Current designs to overhaul the car computer system use a central processing hub with ancillary hubs controlling localized sensors. By doing this you cut the number of hi speed wiring necessary to make real time decisions. This cuts costs to be affordable to significantly more people while allowing ASICs to do one task very efficiently (lane sensors, distance sensors, foreign object sensors, traffic light sensors, etc.). The central hub is programmed to receive, interpret, react, and communicate with the other cars.

BUT, assuming someone can actually solve it and get regulatory approval, it is absolutely the greatest potential value creation mechanism in history.back of envelope math... 3 TRILLION miles are driven in the united states ALONE every year. not counting the rest of the world. if you get just 10% adoption, at $1/mi - which is cheaper than uber, that's $300B of revenue. that's roughly the same as the largest company in the world - saudi aramco. and that's just based on US miles.so when Elon Musk says Tesla will be the largest company in the world.. he's right.

And if you isolate just to the target demographics that have the money to afford their vehicles, it's more like 1/50th as good. (Yes, poor people have a lot of accidents).Tesla is even worse. They're not public with their data, but there is crowd sourced data. Autopilot on the highway is about 1/500th as good as the average driver. FSD is about 1/50,000th as good as the average driver.The technology is shit and has at best reached a 10% solution that's being sold as an 80% solution. And that was the low hanging fruit.

The company's plans to expand to other cities such as San Francisco is an indication that autonomous ride-hailing is a matter of when, not if. You can hail Waymo in San Franciscio but its limited to a small group of users.In my opinion, I predict that within the next decade, fully autonomous ride-hailing services will become widespread in major US metropolitan cities.

Unlike IT giants Google and Baidu and automaker Tesle, autonomous driving and driver assistant are Mobileye's main products.    In terms of investment, I would recommend Robotaxi as the closest monetizable area in this industry (Baidu has already launched 2,000 such cars in China). Mobileye is now testing its Robotaxi in Munich, Detroit, and Jerusalem.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10idy44/why_am_i_never_beating_the_market/'
POST_TEXT: b'So I have this odd conundrum where whenever days are Down I am usually beating the NASDAQ and generally the S&P (sometimes the DOW) but whenever days are up, I am never beating those. As an example, last friday I was only up 1%. \n\nOn a previous day when the market was acting volatile, I was beating the Indicies when it went down, but again, not as much when it went up.\n\nI look at my portfolio and am puzzled. I own majority of large caps like APPLE, BX, Delta, Visa etc.. plus mid/small caps that have done well. I do relatively decent, but is it really a question of just owning these stocks that go up 10% in a day such as UPST, NVDA etc.. and just deal with it when they go down a lot? \n\nI am getting seriously discouraged and may just go into index funds.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 06:09:59'] If you really want to beat the market you need time. Beating it on a daily basis is unrealistic. Give yourself at least 3-5 years to measure your success. Realistically speaking, you should give yourself 10 years to measure your success (given your analysis is a 10 year holding period), but humans have a life span and giving up 10 years to underperform when you‚Äôre starting at the age of 30+ can significantly impact your retirement. You should also know that majority of investors do not beat the index (historically). There is absolutely nothing wrong with going with the index.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 02:52:53'] Individual stocks don't always correlate with the market. Friday was a good session across all indeces, but Apple for example stayed red most of the session. The S&P 500 is made out of 11 sectors, and some of these sectors do better than others in specific days.The Communication sector was the best performer on Friday, and close 2nd was tech. Some days the S&P would be green because one of these sectors will be keeping it up but the rest of the sectors will be red. There is no correlation between individual stocks and the market ( and I'm defining the market as the S&P 500 here )
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 23:41:49'] This market for the last year has felt very Bearish. Even with the best stock, right now the best you You can do is keep dripping into good strong investments and wait the storm out till we hit a bull market again
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 06:19:51'] I don't think you realize the chance of you beating the market is really, really, really low.  I am not going to try to dissuade you or others, but will link at the bottom the data.  It comes from JPM own Private Banking arm to their own dismay.  In they looked at ALL the individual stocks from 1980 to their publication date 2014 so >30 years.  It showed over that time period the MEDIAN return of all stocks during that time was -53%.  Yep, that is NEGATIVE 53%.  Well what is the chances of finding the next multibagger?  Well the chances of finding a stock that will 5x the index is only 7% of all stocks.  So VERY unlikely.  Every major study that has been done (BHB and BSB) has shown active management (picking stocks and/ or market timing only LOSES money vs. just sticking to your asset allocation.  The ongoing SPIVA and DALBAR studies show over and over and over again the same that active management loses money over the index.  So if you are going to be a active investor you have to accept you will be a loser in the end.  Sorry but that is going to be the end story.  You will be poorer.  Folks either get it and go passive and become richer or they don't and stay active and end up poorer.  https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 23:54:47'] Concentration builds wealth; diversification preserves it. Unless you are Peter Lynch picking thousands of hundred-bagger stocks in your lifetime, you will probably not beat the market if you are heavily diversified.On the other hand, if you focus on a few stocks that you heavily research and keep up with and buy at an undervalued price relative to future cash flows, you could beat the market. However, going to route of concentration incurs more risk because you could also underperform the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 06:26:41'] As you see its possible that most stocks do not beat the market, and the market is carried by a few that outperform by a great margin. (in fact most individual stocks can go down over time and only the market as a whole will rise). So if you just pick stocks at random, you are more likely to lose vs the market. That is why diversification is usually beneficial. If you are bad at picking stocks its even worse.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 06:41:14'] What % of your portfolio are you holding in cash?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 06:45:47'] It's very common. Most people actively investing underperform the broad market, ***especially*** on a risk adjusted return basis.I'd say temper your expectations and don't expect to beat the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 07:11:05'] Short answer is that speculative stocks tend to jump around more. Safer more established companies tend to have less movement. The index has some component of speculative stocks, yours does not. There are tools out there that measure the ‚Äúbeta‚Äù and ‚Äúalpha‚Äù of a portfolio, which can tell you how your portfolio is expected to move vs the market. Word of warning though, what goes up can also go down. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs likely your portfolio vastly outperformed a portfolio with more speculative stocks last year. The more risk you introduce, the higher likelihood you‚Äôll underproduce as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 07:22:22'] You're better off with at least 50% in index funds ...maybe.But I think you just have to wait it out since individual stocks move more than indexes daily and of course the market is down so you'll be down more now than the index.But you.do have to have good companies mostly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 07:55:14'] Diversify your portfolio to better track the overall day trend if that‚Äôs important to you.  A heavy NYSE portfolio on a bad NASDAQ day looks great.  On a bad NYSE day yet great NASDAQ day, it looks bad.  I personally don‚Äôt care about daily market trends.  Overall portfolio health is more important, yet obviously the shorter view as it should be.  My job is my portfolio, not the longer term conditions of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 08:07:52'] Aggressive investors can beat S&P500 in a bull year. Unless you invests mostly in cash, few lose less than S&P500 like 2022 year.  To come up with a portfolio that can beat S&P in a bull year but lose less in a bear year is difficult.  Without looking at your portfolio and trading pattern it is hard to tell. But from tickers was posted you are not staying in better quality stocks that will hold up more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 08:27:12'] Your portfolio has a beta of <1.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 09:02:05'] I think there's like 10% of stocks that are responsible for the majority of the up movement in the S&P index over any given period.If you don't own all of those you're not going to beat the index.That's the problem that you have to solve to beat the index.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 09:21:14'] Are you comparing your portfolio as a whole to just the equity portion?  I have a 65/35 allocation so it would not be appropriate for me to think that it would track the S&P.  The more appropriate comparison would be to a balanced fund.If you are just comparing your equity positions then it may be that you have lower beta holdings etc.  Also since you have small cap exposure then that will correlate less with the S&P.  I would worry less about the correlation and more about whether your portfolio matches your risk tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 09:29:35'] Here's a black mirror: Why do you care?  Like, honestly, do you want to get to the end of your life and have people at your funeral saying, "You know, we should all remember Inevitable Night 993's ability to beat the market on up-days."  Is your goal to beat the market... or to end up with more money later in your life than you have now?  If your goal is to beat the market, that's an ego problem.  If you plan to DCA or add any money to your account over time, you are mathematically more likely to fail to beat the market.   If you just want more money? You're doing fine. Enjoy the ride and do what you can to smooth it out to save yourself the stress.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 12:14:59'] Look up the beta values of your stocks, weigh them according to your positions and add them up. Strong chance it's below one, meaning when the markets go up you'll go up slightly less and when the markets go down, you fo down slightly less. E.g. Tesla has a high beta and coca cola a low one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 12:15:05'] I think why people don‚Äôt beat the market is because the market is constantly moving, it‚Äôs constantly ‚Äúin a position‚Äù and when people are only trading or swinging for part of the day they will tend to miss the biggest moves, then you fall behind. I always stay in my index fubds

They should set up merchandising and make a serious bid into gaming.  I think it would be cool if Netflix had a tv remote that could turn into a gaming controller.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 13:04:56'] Today I bought a random mixture of stocks/ETFs:2 shares of AVDV (ex-US small cap value), 1 share of AVUV (US small cap value), 5 shares of PSCE (small cap oil), 5 more shares of BTU (US thermal/seaborne thermal/seaborne met coal), and a little bit to my Retirement Fund.I had just opened my BTU position recently and am slightly up 3%, so am adding while i can. There is a major catalyst coming up in the next few weeks which could see huge upside (debt covenants getting released --> shareholder returns). And downside if management does something stupid.I had also bought AMR (met coal) recently and am already up some 12% so reluctant to keep on adding. Coal Twitter seems to be taking profits on AMR although noting it is still relatively cheap.I'll make a post about coal, but basically the bull thesis for the next few years isn't that prices are going to be absurdly high like earlier this year, but that the 'new low' is a lot higher. If you look at forward curves for thermal or met coal pricing into 2023/2024, they are still very high. Given that these coal companies are priced cheaply even at those prices, they are a pretty good deal, although not the multi-baggers they once were.As a side note, hang out on Twitter and check out the Spaces. You can get some fantastic DD from people in the industry or major investors talking about their bull or bear cases. For example, yesterday I was listening to a guy in Australia talking about the shortages of coal thanks to floods.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 07:44:41'] Feel like I'm missing something. Big tech firms are laying off tens of thousands of folks every day, the full effects of the interest rates have barely started and the most recent jobless claims weren't as bad (which is against what the Fed want). Feds have also repeatedly stated they won't pivot this year.And yet, SPY is quite up in the last weeks (10% from its lows) and a lot of non-profitable companies are bigly up in the last few weeks.

That's now just about every big tech name preserving their earnings (through layoffs).Google cutting 12,000 positions, assuming an average of $200k savings per position, is 2.4B in earnings recovered. 2021 net income of 76B, that's a ~3.2% increase.Not bad for the swipe of a pen. And considering how much the payroll has grown, I'm not very concerned about the effect on operations. Likely low performers were top of the list.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:34:56'] Looking at WAL-western alliance bank. Regional bank based in Arizona. They're currently trading at 6.7x earnings, and are forecast to grow earnings 10% per year for the next few years. Similarly growing regionals trade at 10x earnings or more. Potentially a 60% upside if the multiple corrects to that level. Any thoughts?

Is that correct or is something wrong?E.g. if I was expecting a 500 dollar refund, when I entered that I made 100 dollars in interest from Tbills my refund decreased to 400 dollars.Are Tbills not tax efficient for those of us who would usually be receiving some amount of refund?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 14:04:27'] I see people telling you not to diversify more, and that is 100% incorrect. If putting $1000 into amazon in 1997 would've been millions, then putting $100 in would've been plenty for me. Putting $10 in would've been nice, too. I'm suggesting you buy stuff you use. Buy stuff you believe in. Buy stuff that sounds cool. You don't need to buy much to make much. I'd also suggest getting some more* dividends rolling. Either way, you're doing better than most of your age. This isn't financial advice specifically tailored for your situation as I don't know your specific situation, so I have to say:this is not financial advice.Edit*

Eventually life will limit the amount of risk taking. Don‚Äôt give away the chance to fail miserably or hit it out the park at such a young age. If you do fail, you have time on your side to recover and not even notice bad investments you had.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-26 08:40:30'] Nvidia is a long term play for most. I can see a lot of the overpriced tech stocks being sold off over the next few months as people move their money out and into banks, airlines, cruiselines, oil, etc. If coronavirus is seasonal we won‚Äôt hear too much about it and all the focus will be on reopenings. The fall could be interesting as it may return combined with less fiscal policy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-26 14:10:05'] Glad you were able to lock in 34% returns. I researched NVDA some time back, and it definitely looked overpriced. Here is an [article](https://www.dorla.org/blog/is-nvidia-overpriced/) explaining in detail for those who might want to get in on the action.  It is often better to know and understand what you own.

POST_TEXT: b"Nvidia has announced to report Q3 earnings on November 18. I've been following the release of the RTX 30 series quite closely, and as many of you probably know the supply has been extremely limited. I think that the people that want to upgrade their GPU or build a PC will postpone this until they can get their hands on one of these cards because they are better and cheaper than the previous generation. If you don't need your new GPU that urgent, you will probably wait until there is more stock available. Is anyone else concerned about this? Recent tech earnings have been punished heavily in the market for not performing well. I think that NVDA might plummet when they report that GPU sales have been down for the last 2 months."
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 12:06:18'] AMD finally has good gaming GPUs, though Nvidia still has a monopoly on datacenter GPUs. That said, supply shortage and real competition from AMD... looks to me like NVDA should take a diver after earnings
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 13:40:34'] I think that the earnings will depend on the performance on Nvidia‚Äôs data center sales, not the release of the 3000 series which is too early to see in Q3 and not interesting for investors. Do I know where it will go? No. I‚Äôm long.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 18:44:41'] NVDA will be at least 750 a share this time next year. This is one stock I just keep buying every time it dips 7-10%.. been at it since it was 45 a share. Long.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 20:43:59'] Supply shortages will hurt both NVDA and SNE's numbers. The demand is there but not enough resources to meet it
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 14:07:01'] Made 500 off NVDA today off a 5k I put in yesterday
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 13:54:45'] all the other big tech stocks dumped after earnings last 2 weeks, not feeling confident. I sold at 545 a few weeks ago, annoyed I didn't buy in again when it was below 500 but I thought the market would tank further. Guess I'll be looking to buy the next dip, big run from nvda today.  The rtx 3000 series looks great but they can't seem to deliver the product, but on the other hand there is no shortage of demand so that's got to be a positive right? The new amd gpu's look great too but i'm guessing there's room for both of these 2.

POST_TEXT: b"After reaching a valuation of more than $800 billion in late 2021, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell sharply -- intermittently by as 70% from the all-time high. With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology. Moreover, investors should consider that the market is already pricing lots of optimism--with NVDA shares valued at a FWD EV/EBIT of close to x60.\n\nNvidia is scheduled to report Q4 2022 earnings on February 22nd, and I assign a 'Hold' rating pre-announcement."

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-18 06:02:32'] NVDA, but I'd wait until after earnings to buy it. People are snapping it up right now, and don't get me wrong, I don't think buying it is unjustified. But I hate buying before earnings because the speculation gets so hectic. Right now it's getting bought up, so unless the reporting ends up being amazing, I think people take some profits. I'm looking for a drop to buy more after earnings as a result. I could be wrong though. I really do want more NVDA, but I want avoid buying on upwards hype/pre-earnings trading. I don't know as much about WMT and I haven't been actively watching it. I probably should at some point but you can only follow so many stocks simultaneously before you start to miss the important details. BABA, no comment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:34:04'] IMO it's fine if the company thinks GAAP doesn't properly recognize certain transactions, or they had unusual expenses that don't reflect their typical operations.  Things like AMD excluding amortization from intangibles acquired from Xilinks is fine.  EPAM excluding relocation expenses for employees in 2022 is fine.  These non-GAAP metrics enhance the predictive value of the financial statements.    Excluding SBC, however, has never made sense to me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:32:03'] I agr√©e, i think EBDITA is good for some companies with high non cash expenses but valuing cash flow is even better. Adjusted EBDITA is the real dumb one. You see companies take out all types of shit to still be unprofitable. Looking at you Uber, Snap, NVDA etc
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:57:59'] what they report on the headlines is one thing.  but they still have GAAP earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 07:09:08'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:33:50'] Non-GAAP is used as a model to talk about the intended future of the company. SBC and high labor costs are usually not related to the operational core of the business usefull to modelling future performance - well into/after the growth phase.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:12:03'] Non gaap has its place. When CVS did it's big payout a few quarters ago it released gaap numbers (bad) and adjusted EPS, which took out that settlement. It gives a better picture of what is going on with the business outside of one off things. However, if a company constantly leads with adjusted numbers it is a huge red flag.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 05:47:05'] None of it‚Äôs needed. EBITDA makes sense when comparing to peers but not for valuation. Why pretend a company has no capex, debt and tax obligations unless you‚Äôre playing lender and substituting their debt service with your own, EBITDA is just a peer comparison tool.Adjusted EBITDA means that pretending they had no interest, capex, and taxes and still looked like crap.Levered and unlevered cash flow is a much better measure of a company‚Äôs performance as it is much harder to manipulate. Take your cash net of operations and take out working capital needs, capex, acquisition, and anything else significant to the firms ongoing performance. Back out annual debt service (this requires looking into their foot notes to calculate). By familiarizing yourself with their 10-k and 10-Q reports you‚Äôll know when to remove any non-recurring events. You don‚Äôt need any non gaaap or adj EBITDA measures.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 13:48:27'] Google will fall more, it's an ads business and we're heading towards a global recession. You people should start noticing how the companies make money and not just their P/E or how much they fell YTD.Nvidia will also fall more because of China sanctions, Ethereum switching to proof of stake and global recession ahead. The stock was crazy overvalued after the massive rally post Covid (which I have contributed and made lots of money, but I sold everything months ago).I don't see much upside from Apple, IMHO the stock will underperform the market in the next 5 years. It's a huge, mature company right now with limited growth potential.Microsoft is definitely the best one among those because of their cloud business, their Microsoft Office business (which is extremely resilient even in a recession because companies can't function without it) and their expansion into gaming with Activision Blizzard acquisition. They are also active (and expanding) in some professional software for data management which can net good money in the future. Of course Microsoft is also a huge, mature company but it has more room to grow than Apple. And it's safe even in a recession because their revenue are more recession proof compared to Google, Nvidia and even Apple (which sells to consumers for the most part).

Recession incoming, and electric vehicle sales growing quickly sure doesn‚Äôt help.  There will be an epic short opportunity in the near future on these inflated oil companies.  It wasn‚Äôt long ago funds wouldn‚Äôt touch them, and once demand starts to contract the reality is that these companies have stranded assets.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 18:08:12'] All trashs, they are nowhere near tesla
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 13:53:33'] Yes, this works in ZIRP interest market.  We are far away from that now and in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 18:07:02'] Reading the comments here is pretty funny.  I wonder what the returns are for everyone here who is ecstatic to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 13:27:03'] Honestly solid man. I‚Äôve owned Apple for about 5 years too
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 16:23:18'] well fuck you for waiting for my stocks to fall further then haha

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 01:45:40'] 5 year return on TSLA is just shy of 1000% (955%)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:19:47'] AMZN, GOOGL and BABA seem to have had the biggest drops against their three year highs. Assuming China gives up on the zero covid policy, and people decide to spend this holiday season, would now be a good time to invest in any of these stocks?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 03:27:07'] Wwe is beating the market
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 03:38:58'] my only problem with this is that you're looking at the past trying to determine the future. that's not how this works. I'm looking for the next AMZN or I'll happily die trying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:35:01'] Rip
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 06:01:48'] I am very surprised that Google is as profitable as it is.  If I where a major share holder I'd clean house because they clearly have a siloed culture.  That is, every team works on their own project without much feedback or communication between teams.  No real product road map to speak of.  Plus, many of these teams have "Not Invented Here" mentality which has lead to a serious duplication of work.  In the last decade they have launched nearly half a dozen operating systems.  Another example would be Google Stadia's, which ran on a Windows compatibility layer on Linux, did not use any Wine or Proton code what so ever.  The engineers justification for doing so was so they could learn how compatibility layers work.  Because they clearly do not have a road map, and siloed internally they lack a clear vision for the company.  Hopefully someone eventually comes in and makes these changes because while it may be profitable, it's clearly not run very well at all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 14:02:27'] That means they all have lot more to fall. I will revisit in 6 months.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 00:02:02'] AAPL to 80, MSFT to 140, NVDA to 60
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 15:58:25'] I‚Äôm glad you all love your tech bags. You‚Äôre going to be spending a lot of time together üòÇ

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 16:25:35'] Why not save cash, and wait until those big ones really fall in price?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 08:17:39'] No shit they have beaten the market the last five years; that is why they are some of the biggest companies in the world right now.
