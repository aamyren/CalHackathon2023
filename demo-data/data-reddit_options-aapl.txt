	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 12:13:39'] Seems ambitious.  AAPL is at their all-time high.  You're betting on them exceeding their all-time high by $50.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 12:31:19'] .07 delta gives this about a 7% probability of being ITM at expiration, so it is a long shot to profit . . .With that said, if any stock can pop up over time it is AAPL.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 13:33:05'] $230 strike is nuts. If it actually went well above $230, is making +200% with a lower strike really not good enough? Would feel pretty bad if it went all the way to $210, you lose everything, but a lower strike would have been a two-bagger or more

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 18:58:36'] So by July 1 you would need a 1.38% gain in AAPL to be positive with this trade. By the end of July you’ll need at least a 4.6% increase in AAPL from where it is currently. By the end of september you will need a 7.87% increase in AAPL just to be positive. Honestly I think AAPL could easily keep up with that pace if we look at the stocks monthly performance lately. But it is pushing all time highs and could start to falter. Apple is here to stay but right now everyone is talking about AI and they release the headset and siri is still siri. If they have questionable earnings between now and then it could fuck your contracts up as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:32:34'] If you look at the price history of AAPL stock from the WWDC through the following week, there's a sell-off more often than not. IIRC, there was a selloff in 4 out of the last 5 WWDC, not counting 2023 (the week isn't over yet).It's a pretty routine pattern of buy the hype, sell the news.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 18:26:08'] same with SPX diagonals. could have closed for 150. I rolled the short leg. I just did the maths, two red days on SPX = 21% in the past 5 years, and the recovery of red-green days is about 1%... I thiiinkkk we will be fine, because AAPL is SPX at this point lol. Otherwise I will roll again to be vertical calls for 7/6.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 15:45:00'] You're talking about such small numbers.  That option was $0.15 at close of business yesterday, so 20% of $0.15 is only 3 cents.  That's a rounding error.But in any event, AAPL closed at $166.65 yesterday, so your break even on that put, you would need, over the course of six trading days, for AAPL to drop down to $154.85, or, a total drop of $11.80.That's $1.97 that it needs to drop each day, on average.  It only dropped $1.63 today, so it's not on pace with what you need it to drop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 09:01:09'] The main reason we trade options **is for leverage**. So it should be no surprise that an OTM put loses more money than the underlying on a percentage basis. If your put had gained 20% to a 1% favorable move of the underlying, would you have posted about it?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 19:30:19'] Two things you should look at in this case is time decay and vega. Being far OTM (tiny delta) impvol could have been really high already before the drop (priced in premium by the seller) so you didnt gain much on vega as the the curve didnt really raise upon the drop (sticky strike)? I dont know because i dont have  the data. Also, just realized this is a weekly so your theta (cost) is huge relative to your gamma (profit driving), which also suggest to me that implied must have been huge as expect.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 03:39:23'] Out of the money options decrease in value over time (theta). The closer they get to expiration the faster their price drops (exponential). Just look at any option chain and you can see the price gains/losses in the various options and their theta. The only way a trader could make money being long the 155 4/28 put would be if AAPL had a huge drop in 1 week - not likely to happen. So, it's highly likely that the 155 puts will expire worthless next Friday. A very common mistake that newbie options traders make is to buy cheap, out of the money options that expire worthless. A better way to make money currently trading AAPL options (assuming you are bearish) is to sell a vertical call spread above the current price of AAPL, like the 170/172.5 for .19. During the recent rally AAPL stayed below 170, so it's highly likely that AAPL will not rally above 170 in the coming week, so if you sell the 170/172.5 call spread (1 of them) you will pocket $19. Theta is working in your favor. Selling options puts the odds in your favor and buying them is like swimming upstream. This doesn't mean you can't make money buying options, but the premium decay is working against you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 07:46:02'] It’s close to expiration, hence option value will decay faster to 0, assuming everything else stays the same.Important to remember options do not decay linearly by time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 07:51:02'] Most people are mean and will make fun of you rather than try to help but theirs many issues with this trading. Obviously your new to options. BUT this is the best way to learn.  we all had to at some point. Message me and I can give ya some advice
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 08:54:24'] Simply stated, the put being profitable has to do with the probability of it being ITM at expiration.  Options are leveraged meaning they can gain value fast, but also lose value faster.The delta of the 155 put is around .05 which is about a 5% probability of being ITM to profit.  The value is about .12 or $12 (you don't say what you paid for it) so I can't comment on how much this has lost. The probability will continue to drop and theta decay will continue dropping the value unless the stock makes a very fast and strong move down, and a lot more than 1%, over the last 6 days the trade has left.  AAPL will need to drop $10+ this week for this put to start to show any recovery and possible profit . . .

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 23:27:15'] main risk is AAPL actually steadily goes down over the next year or two.  Covered calls mutes gains.  covered calls are great for sideways to slightly bullish markets.  we are sideways to slightly bearish.  The other problem is your mechanical protocol for selling calls.  The worst thing you can do is sell calls on a programmatic, regular basis.  There is a time and place for selling calls (after a large runup) and a time and place for selling puts (after the stock has been heavily sold off).  In reality three are probably 3-6 times a year it's optimal for selling calls.  You should probably use technical analysis on when to sell calls.People have this idea that they can buy leaps, and sell calls against it 30-45 DTE inperpetuity and never get assigned.  It just doesn't work that way.  Your calls are 2.8 years to expiration, and there is an excellent chance that your short call will be assigned within the first 3-4 times you sell it (and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, depending on how you do it.  Your entire position might close for a profit, or maybe a loss if you don't do it properly.)Then you might say "well I'll just roll my call", and that isn't easy...and sometimes you can't favorably roll it.  You might have to stretch it out an extra 3-6 months, and then you have this short obligation in your account that you can't get out of because if you do, you'll end up closing your position for a loss.  It's just not easy.BTW, the Dec 2025 90 C (which is 92 delta), has ask of 72.  Let's just say you can purchase it for 70.  Your break even is 160, and AAPL is at 145 right now.  That's a fair bit of time value in that premium of 70.  15 of it can decay.  That is more than you might think.  The best LEAP calls to buy have very little extrinsic value to them.It''s not a bad strategy, but mechanically selling 30 DTE calls is probably the easiest way to lose money.For instance, I recently bought JNJ Jan 2024 130 calls.  They are down 10% and I'm not selling any calls against it now because JNJ continues to drop.  I need to wait, and I need to be patient.  My break even is like 157 or so, so I need to wait until JNJ goes up some and THEN I'll sell a call.  I might be aggressive about it too because it's such low IV, but I don't expect to make more than 10-20% on this position.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 21:30:43'] If there is a market crash and Apple stock is affected the value of your LEAPS will go WAY down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 00:09:02'] The risk is a very expensive company drops back to historical range and you get absolutely slaughteredOr there’s a market crash (which is likely) and your leaps get crushed and you can’t sell enough premium to recoverOr the price stays flat and you only squeeze a small return and you suddenly get called away and you wasted your time
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 06:23:26'] As others have said the stock dropping is the main risk.Selling monthly short calls at .15 or .20 deltas may get challenged as AAPL tends to move quickly at times, but you should be able to roll these out since you have a long time horizon.Another possible risk is a short call getting assigned which could result in your selling to close the LEAPS early, but this will usually result in an overall net profit, so not a big risk.   You could always buy shares of AAPL and then sell covered calls well OTM and close for a profit early to help avoid the shares being called away.  This accomplishes the same thing without concern for theta decay on the LEAPS option.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 18:05:37'] I recommend starting with one contract. After some time you can start increasing and see how much of your portfolio you want to leverage. Two contracts, then 4 or 5. Maybe someday all 10. Stay very OTM to start. It may be small premium to start but that’ll get you comfortable and you can increase risk after that. One way to look at shares being called is that it is a good thing. You’ve taken profits. Then sell puts. You can always get more shares back. Lots of sound advice here in other comments. I second avoiding earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 17:38:21'] If you sell for example $160 calls two weeks out you will get .58 cents.  So sell 5.  If you get close to to getting called you can roll the 5 calls to 10 calls at 170.Don’t sell calls when earnings are imminent.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 18:39:31'] If you don’t want them to be called away, then don’t sell covered calls.  Simple as that.  No free lunch.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 19:56:52'] Something like this would work well.AAPL is trading for $150 currently.Two of each except the last one which is four contracts.&#x200B;* \-2 $180 Call 1/20/2023 Exp • Sell -$0.50 <--(20% move for assignment on this strike).* \-2 $185 Call 1/20/2023 Exp • Sell -$0.28 <--(23% move for assignment).* \-2 $190 Call 1/20/2023 Exp • Sell -$0.17 <--(26% move).* \-4 $195 Call 1/20/2023 Exp • Sell -$0.11 <--(30% move).&#x200B;50+50  +  28+28  +  17+17  +  11+11+11+11  = $234.You should be able to sell equivalent OTM calls every two months for around $1,400 per year in call premium.FYI - short calls are best executed when a the share-price is at resistance. So if you can identify when apple price is on an up-swing (at apex), you'll be better off! Because then you can sell strike prices closer to the share price and claim more juicy premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 17:01:16'] How risky do you want to be? More risk more reward. You can sell the $10 premium ones each week
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 20:28:42'] Use the Greeks.  Keep it simple. Sell calls with a delta of .15 or less.  You choose the timeframe you’re comfortable with, but I would say go with monthly expirations on covered calls.  If they do get called away, sell puts at your desired price and sell them until you get your shares back.  Then sell calls again!  I understand your tax consequences, but if the price starts going up, roll them to a higher strike (or same strike further out) for the same price you pay to buy them back (That or let them go and sell puts.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 21:33:10'] It’s not nearly as scary as everyone here thinks. Leary to roll them and always for a credit. Do you care if you have to roll them months out but you collect cash?You plan on keeping them so just keep rolling. If you’re ITM near expiry roll them early so the premium keeps them from being exercised. Far easier than most think.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 18:18:03'] People say getting stock called away must not have long term holds that if sold would create large tax liability even at long-term gains. Stick with far out of the money calls and consider it a bonus on top of long term appreciation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 18:52:09'] There is no rule that says you have to sell 8 calls. Sell one call and get familiar with the movement and risk.  Calendar spread them.  Spread them amongst different strikes.  Risk management is key to success.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 19:19:14'] My vote is do not sell the calls if you really want to keep the position.  I only sell options on positions I’m indifferent to being assigned on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 21:52:32'] I have been doing that for years. Although I only have 700 shares, I will sell covered calls, and since I do not want them assigned, I will buy back the calls usually for a breakeven price. I live a little more dangerously as I will sell in slightly in the money calls for a higher premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 22:27:31'] Only do it on stocks you want to get rid of any way.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 23:01:10'] covered calls you have to be willing to sell. if you dont want to sell, dont do cc. i imagine the price you would want to maybe sell at will net you a whopping $5 per contract. I do that, but i'm ok with selling at a huge underlying profit
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 23:05:20'] It’s going down within weeks along with broader sentiment. I’m long aapl. Sell at 2-2.5 SD to the upside
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 06:48:56'] You can never be sure the shares won’t be called away, so keep that in mind.To lower the odds sell 30-45+ dte calls .30 or lower and then close when it hits a 50% profit.  If the stock moves up to get close to the strike then roll up and out for a net credit that will reduce the chances anyone will want to exercise early.  In a worse case close the CC for a loss if it is ITM and getting within about 10 days of expiration.  Close before an ex-Div date as exercise may happen to collect the divi, or roll out to make sure there is a lot of extrinsic value that will reduce the odds of someone exercising early.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 07:34:10'] I would say ladder your covered calls (sell at different strike prices, accepting less premium for prices further from the strike) and roll any that fall in the money close to expectation
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 19:51:01'] If you don’t want to loose them, don’t sell them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 21:03:21'] If you dont want to get called DONT SELL CALLS
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 17:24:26'] A helpful tool is the RSI three month and yearly chart.  Your broker might give you access to it.    Selling calls around 15 bucks above price at one month out expiry, when RSI is above 70, gives you a nice premium and no reason to complain if your shares get called away.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 20:58:26'] Sell OTM calls at around 16 delta or less. This puts you in the 1 SD+ range. But the most important metric is the IV Rank and or Percentile. If you wait for high IV, you can get the same premiums but at a wider call strike.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 22:17:08'] You need to wait for the right time….like when AAPL has reached a relative high.  Only then do you sell a deep OTM call like 10-15 delta.  Like 45 DTE or so.  You will only be able to do this 2-4 times a year…so it will act like an additional dividend.  Just remember if you sell enough calls, one day those calls will be ITM.  Nothin for free.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 08:09:28'] I am in covered call etfs, very low MER. 0% return year to date... beat the market by 20%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 08:22:42'] If stock price reaches strike price roll the call further in time, or up in strike, or both to avoid assignment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 08:42:39'] Your shares will most likely be called away. Sell weekly to bi-weekly calls. Save the credit you get to then close out the calls around 50%. In order to not get called away your gonna have to time manage with watching the prices and picking a suitable expiration date

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 11:12:49'] LEAP puts yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:03:58'] You have contradicted yourself in this statement.  If you are believing the market will stay bearish and a recession is near a leap would just burn off theta and intrinsic value killing the value of the leap.   I honestly wouldn't start think of buying leaps until you think the market has bottomed or the market sediment has turned bullish.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 11:07:21'] Doesn’t matter expiration or amount of theta you buy—a correct prediction regarding price action is required for an option strategy. If you have a long LEAP and price moves against you, it will require a lot more momentum and reversal in the other direction to recover. Be confident of entry and exit points with regards to price action when trading options.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 14:42:23'] That's a dangerous game. The reality is that the market is tethered to the Fed right now. Core CPI has been 6% and has not been going down. Historically the fed will raise rates until it surpasses core CPI. I.E. in 2006 it rose to around 5.5% and then paused when inflation was in the 4% range. We are currently at 2.25 - 2.50 and will go 3.0 - 3.25 tomorrow. Buying leaps is hoping inflation will really start going down hard soon. Usually after the fed pause you get a recession. Again the 2006 pause at 5.5. happened in December, by October 2007 you had the bankruptcies start. That's 10 months after the last hike The typical recession correction is between 30 and 50 percent. Spx high last year was 4300. This implies a range of 2100 to 3000 if a recession occurs. Which I would argue we just started the recession in the first 2 quarters. This would resemble a .com 99-2002 recession where you just had a really really crappy market for 3 years as things just grinded lower.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:23:43'] No, because in my opinion LEAPS calls don't have any market condition in which they are superior to all other trading strats and structures.What makes you think you can predict the future value of a contract more than a year into the future? I don't trust my forecasts beyond a week, let alone more than a year. There is not a single trading decision I made over a year ago that would stand up today.Until LEAPS have 15+ year expirations, when the long term average of a national equity market like the US has a fairly reliable history and rationale (positive GDP grows equity market) and forecasts based on that history tend to hold up, I'm not interested.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 10:47:30'] Only leaps I’d be buying right now are so far ITM ones that have next to no time value left. Only would be using them to have a smaller outlay of cash vs buying shares. Buying juicy ones are going to bleed value over time. But if you think we’ll see a quick recovery, go for it. Would probably be better to buy a shorter dated option in that case anyways but it’s up to you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 12:00:07'] With options you are receiving extra gains/leverage by taking on time risk.  Even LEAPs expire eventually.  It depends on how long you think the bear market is going to last.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 05:49:51'] I'm not really a big fan of buying puts on AAPL.  There are basically five possibilities for stocks:* They can go up a lot* They can go up a little* They can stay the same* They can go down a little* They can go down a lotWhen you buy a put, the only way you make money is if they go down a lot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 06:22:39'] I agree.  Some trades to consider:  put calendar spread (e.g. short Sept 170p, long Nov 170p)…these are cheap and you make money even if AAPL goes up a little. Can also try an ITM debit put spread. Like the Oct 180/170 has a break even above the current price right now.  So there is decay on that soread. Can also try 180/175 which is entirely ITM and returns close to 80% of it maxes out (AAPL less than 175 by October)

If you think it’s going to go down but still like it for long term, sell puts at a strike price that you think is a fair valuation. This way, you collect premiums while you wait for AAPL to reach your buy price. You probably need cash in your account to cover 100x the strike price of the sold out which is a lot of money, but it’s a good way to make money while you wait

The RSI is looking good, the trend to the upside is looking good, a break above $175 will put a stock in the $180’s on the board. Knowing all that, I wouldn’t be confident in putting on a short position on AAPL. I like to trade with confidence and puts would give me zero confidence at this level.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 22:06:32'] AAPL is a cash generation machine… (unlike the cash furnace of the Musk-melon). August is historically a ‘good’ month for AAPL… September is NOT… buy slightly OTM PUTs for Sept 30 exp.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 22:10:38'] If you screened through all the comments in the thread, generally they are two broad group of respondents here,The knows and the don't-knows.You are clearly one of the don't-knows, let me share a little basic to you about stock options, which i spent sometimes to learn and understand since 2021.Birdview of stock options:Two family of Options: call or putEach family has two direction, either short (sell) or long (buy)So as an novice, i will suggest you start by understanding the below:1. Shorting call, bearish view 2. Longing call, bullish view3. Shorting put, bullish view4. Longing put, bearish viewThus there are generally 2 choices (1 or 4) you can make if you believe all the hearsay you have got about AAPL.Whatever you decide, NEVER short call without 100 stocks of AAPL, should you take on option 1 above.This is equivalent to selling naked call, and this is a suitcide for a novice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 22:30:43'] Call credit spreads all day on AAPL...it has definitely reached a threshold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 01:57:08'] the only trade on the board are put debt spreads or junky call spreads
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 06:53:39'] Selling puts on AAPL.  Long term AAPL is headed up. If there is a dip, I sell puts.  Just my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 12:41:26'] Tbh AAPL calls are what’s saved my portfolio this month. It sank today but I’ve opened up new positions for $177.5 8/26; 175C 8/26; $172.5 8/26. I took a beating today (I held BA calls expiring today and didn’t sell when I should’ve) and I’m looking at opening mid-Sept calls as well

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 15:27:30'] I think calls that are far out in this environment are akin to playing with fire. Apple is always expected to beat earnings, and generally has high analyst ratings. So the question is, what would need to happen to get apple to 180 or close to it so you can exit your trade profitably? Maybe they need to beat by huge amounts, or maybe this market turns around and we bottomed out in June.Ask yourself this, do you think Powell's comments that there will be pain due to interest rises could have an impact on Apple? Let's say the answer is no. After all Apple is a premium brand and they have all kinds of ways of financing their products for customers; plus services and so on. But if we officially get into a recession, one where the unemployment rate meaningfully starts to go up, there has got to be a pretty good chance of at least another market pull back.I don't think anyone can say how far that pull back goes, but Apple will follow the market down, even if less so, you'd still be hard pressed to be at 180. Especially since some would say Apple is currently over valued at a P/E of 26, forward PE of 24, P/B of 42.74, and a market cap at 2.48 T amongst other things. With rising interest rates, the present value of their earnings will have to yield even more for investors to be okay with large multiples.Long story short I think we have more potential pull backs still versus legs up.Time will tell, good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 18:46:18'] 180 is its ATH we won’t reach that unless SPY gets close to all time highs. You might as well buy SPY calls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 14:18:33'] Dunno if I have more experience or not but I’m looking at the Oct 21 $150p.   If we stay in a trading range of 3900-4300, bound to be some up and downs.  Personally thinking we finish this little rally.  Head back south.  Then catch a Santa Clause rally after mid-terms.   Both could pay if managed correctly.  Maybe I’ll do mine first then hop on board with yours.  Kinda curious what this week brings before I jump in.  GL
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 16:34:49'] Bad idea to be buying calls during tightening Unless u are prepared to lose the entire investment then it could be worth a shot very risky though
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 16:58:57'] I think that you should never listen to price targets from paid media analysts. They are all idiots and the sooner you realize that the better.From a technical perspective $AAPL is trapped between major moving averages. As a short term trader I would not touch it on the long side until it breaks through the 200 SMA. If you put a gun to my head and forced me to take a long position I'd sell OTM bull put spread weeklies for as much credit as possible and pray they expire worthless.The market is your primary concern. If the market sells off into EOY there is nothing stopping $AAPL from doing the same. Focus on what the broader market is doing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 19:01:18'] No. You would need AAPL to go up 20% to BREAK EVEN.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 17:39:26'] I sure as hell wouldn’t. Not now anyway. We’ve had a nice little run up during a downtrend. Perfect time to NOT buy OTM AAPL calls
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 16:06:52'] Use volume and price action to look for an entry long. Watch the chart and look for stopping volume (lower wick) on lots of volume or a confirmed pivot low. If you’re that far out look on the daily for the sign. Nobody knows the answer but looking for a good entry low has better odds of working.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 16:16:11'] I think valuations will contract and demand for consumer discretionary will slow in the coming months as rates increase and the economy continues toward a more recessionary environment,  so I wouldn't go that long on AAPL right now. Just my opinion, though. Consider how many Europeans won't be upgrading their iPhone while they try to pay for heating and record high staples, hoping not to be laid off.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 18:06:17'] i think your call will expire worthless unless the Fed actually pivots, which i don't think they will.   I think CPI will print around or slightly below or is at 8.0% on Tuesday, which might squeeze us a bit higher into quadwitching/OPEX this week. After the options reset from OPEX, we will probably sell into fed rate hike since the Fed is supposed to be selling $90bln/month for QT starting this month, September.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 18:22:39'] At least sell a higher strike against it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 19:04:53'] Probably not the species of answer you are looking for, but I did a regular purchase of AAPL this week, very small position.  Essentially I think it is overpriced with price to sales of \~10.  However, it has a duopoly with Microsoft in PC operating systems ownership for the foreseeable future.  I am not very excited about the investment but I needed to own something in tech.  I agree with what others say about rising rates hurting future valuations of AAPL and others.  When interest rates were at an all time high of around 13 to 14% in 1981 to 1982, the average PE of a stock was around 7.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 03:21:14'] AAPL's earnings pattern for the last few years has been:1. The price goes sky high leading up to earnings2. The earnings wildly exceed everyone's expectations3. The price comes crashing down (presumably because lots of people were bidding it up in advance of earnings)This time around, AAPL is up about the same as the overall market.  I can't see it really shattering anyone's expectations.  I have no idea what the price is going to do after earnings because people aren't really bidding it up this time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 22:29:02'] The things to keep in mind with earnings are what the street expects and/or has already baked in to the price of the stock. If expectations are "really bad" and results are only "a little bad" you might get the stock going up. I expect apple to be a bit down with maybe some pull back in revenue from recent quarters, but I haven't been following close enough to know where the street is guessing.Lots of my suspicions are tied to supply chains getting jammed up with apple being heavily reliant on factories in China and the current state of "zero covid policy" effects on that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 23:27:08'] I also thought about buying an AAPL put, but decided not to because I am not willing to take the risk.The way I look at this scenario is buying options prior to earnings is gambling, and I would only gamble with smaller positions. I’m not betting that much money on a coin flip. I don’t care what information I have researched, I simply do not know what the results will be.The entire market is aware of Apple’s negative headlines and China’s COVID policies. It has baked it in to its earnings expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-24 23:33:49'] Staying away from earnings. Been burned before 🔥. Stock rise before earnings is generally a good sign, but it also has resistance near $150. So, your plan looks good to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 05:16:42'] Look at the other tech earnings. Most of them come in better than expected. Not sure why AAPL would be different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 07:57:41'] I play AAPL daily and almost exclusively. Could see this both ways, but my guess is that we see a pump into earnings. They will beat, as they always do. My question is what does FOMC do to affect the market the next week.? I think we pump hard this week, but from there it seems some pullback is inevitable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 17:03:39'] Maybe play the post-ER reaction? Some of their new releases (mainly the iPhone 14) show promise for better future guidance in Q1, with revenue expected to beat year-ago quarter reports by 6.1%; however, with supply chain issues still being a major problem in China. Remove bias from this week’s bull momentum; will be irrelevant come ER. Let the big guys have their fun on Thursday and clean up their scraps on Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 16:35:53'] I day trade MSFT mostly watching options as a general indicator. I would say you are right not to deal with options around earnings as it was not clear to me until near close today what was happening.Price pumping, rosey, easy infact. No trapping, obvious entries. Everything was CALL up up up, I closed out all my positions and looked back EOD and fell for the setup. 250 went down without a fight and then two shorts hit right at 247.5 with a perfect stop run.After hours was an absolute routing, -7%. There are 20k calls at 250 right now at 230ish. A lot of people's days (weeks?) got ruined. 98% positive sentiment on MSFT rally on IBKR newsfood lol. Played.I saw the signs, but didn't put it all together until I watched a -5% sweep at 4:01 pm lol. Luckily I cut my losses pretty fast.The one thing that was clear was that there was effectively no selling opposition until about midday where PUTs at seemingly irrational numbers started coming on the books in volume.Pure pump and dump.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 00:51:00'] Yes  it is possible it didn't get assigned. More than likely the shares will be in your account Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 03:25:11'] The option holder has until 530pm est to exercise an option while the market closes at 4pm. Also there are multiple parties involved in options settlement so the actual process takes a while. You (seller), buyer, both brokers, exchange (cboe), and clearinghouse. It’s actually a fairly complicated process.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 17:36:21'] Not necessarily it's done by "random" lottery.  If it popped after hours above 138 you might have gotten lucky.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 08:46:17'] I feel like there needs to be an Automod reply for this question that gets asked every week.Highly likely you'll be assigned by Monday @ open, but there's always a slight chance you don't, and your put premium received has nothing to do with it

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 10:27:36'] In an assignment, the exchange randomly chooses a broker, and the broker (usually) randomly chooses which of his clients is assigned. You may have been lucky because someone did not exercise their right to sell. Don't count on that in the future!

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:10:51'] Technically, Puts and Calls ALWAYS expire worthless. They are removed from your account upon expiration, regardless of the moneyness. The assignment then is an entirely different transaction in your account. It even happens in a separate account on the brokerage side, under the hood so to speak, since this is about stocks and not options. Therefore it can occur at the beginning of the next trading day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:27:46'] Its possible it wasn’t. You want to get assigned because it is too close to ATM and there is a big probability that the stock will rise Monday. The counterpart decided the same so they won’t exercise. In my personal experience once a contract says expired that is the end of it
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 16:40:26'] FYI, I use Schwab.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 10:54:09'] What was the premium? If your strike was $138 but the buyer paid $2.00 for the option then it wouldn't make sense for them to exercise their option. In this scenario the break even price is $136 ($138 - $2.00 cost)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 19:57:12'] This. Again? Ugh.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 20:52:10'] Doesn’t the price need to be below the break even price to be assigned? 138 strike price miuns the option cost…I would assume that the person owning the 138 PUT won’t execute it unless its below its breakeven price

My take: I was happy to sell the CC with the risk, I’ll accept the profit (albeit less than just holding) and start selling puts til I get it back
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 15:10:28'] My 2 cents:A covered call is a bullish strategy. It is exactly the same risk profile as selling a Deep ITM put. It might feel like you've lost money as the call you sold is now ITM but in reality, you've made money because your Stock has rallied very well. You are bullish. Your current position you lose money if AAPL drops. Selling puts adds to your downside risk, so ask if you really want to be adding to your risk exposure.

A market pull back, which everyone else around here seems to think is a sure thing, could have this be closed for a lot less of a loss or rolled then for more.Theta decay occurs in the last 60 days, so having a short call out 5 months makes little sense regardless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 21:24:55'] So I’ll be the first not person commenting here that thinks AAPL is likely near a near term peak and has had a great run back up less than 10% from its all time high despite everything. Also still trading at a healthy multiple on expected earnings which haven’t been revised downward. Pretty sure you’ll get a chance to enter a trade at a lower price in the near future. Good luck as well
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 07:04:44'] It sounds like you’re making the assumption that the stock price can’t go down from this point. The stock could very well go back down to $130 in the future. If you want more shares than what you currently have then it’s not a bad move. If the stock falls and stays under $150 by expiration, you would still have your shares and then you would be buying more at $150. Not saying it’s a bad move, just pointing out the possibilities
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 00:22:04'] 50/50 chance it'll be below $150 in Dec.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 02:08:49'] LOL.  I have 10 contracts of sold TSLA CCs from July.  Original Strike was $660. Was able to roll it out and up to get up to $710 strike before it got too far out of the money.  BTC y'day at $189/sh (so, that's $189k).  Riding it up and will sell it again at whatever strike I can get for that same amount.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 08:23:35'] I've been rolling mine out and up - on several tech names.  I'm hoping to hold onto many of these names to capture more price improvement. The rolling out & up is not expensive. My actions in AAPL covered calls yesterday: 08/03/2022  Sell to Open  Trade Details  AAPL 09/15/2023 170.00 C  CALL APPLE INC $170 EXP 09/15/23  1  $21.89  $0.70  $2,188.30  08/03/2022  Buy to Close  Trade Details  AAPL 07/21/2023 165.00 C  CALL APPLE INC $165 EXP 07/21/23  1  $22.54  $0.65  \-$2,254.65
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 13:15:32'] Maybe it’ll drop before dec.  You can buy more shares or buy a call above your cc if you think it’s going to continue up.   You should be bought a call above your cc when opened the trade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 13:13:15'] Make sure the strategy is aligned with your goal.  If Aapl tales a dump, you are at risk of being assigned at a price well above market ( your put strike).  If Aapl takes off you will lose the upside on the short call.  You probably know this.  I ooportuniticalky sell OTM calls when Aapl is ATH.  Hard to sell puts ATL as what is your definition of ATL.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:42:51'] If you have the money to cover the put I think selling it is a good idea, but if you’re selling it with the call as collateral then maybe not. Markets are uncertain right now and it might not be a good idea to risk a profitable trade becoming a loss just to try and squeeze some more out of it. If you can cover then do it cause apple is a solid stock to own so it doesn’t hurt to collect the premium on it
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 21:42:59'] I was in a similar boat but closed and then dumped the shares anyway.  AAPL pays a shit dividend and I would rather have some income payers in my taxable account so I moved the money to JEPI.  Roughly made a couple hundred total after that huge Apple run because I was at a fairly low strike and out quite a ways.  Oh well, can’t win them all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 01:36:31'] Difference between a taxable account and non taxable? Please explain? And where do they ask when you sign up? How would you know etc?

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 21:13:12'] Bro u worry me with this question. If you cannot open a trading app and figure out the amount of premium you will get at 5% otm 7 days from today. Anyway I just did you a solid one and right now you will get about $200 per month assuming you sell four covered calls. So a little over 1% percent.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 01:44:12'] Sell 30 delta calls for higher premium or 15 delta if you want a higher chance of keeping sharesEdit: also, although weekly seems more attractive because of faster theta decay, 30-45 DTE actually has higher profits long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 22:19:38'] I hope your cost basis is at $130 otherwise this is a bad move. Weekly's is not the way to go here and you better research this way more than you already have.Premiums are pennies in comparison to value of owning the shares.If you really wanna sell options maybe try selling leaps and lookin for theta decay. Buy to close them when you have made your 5%.Either way I hope you aren't speculating on aapl long term cause you gonna lose your shares
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 06:12:41'] Do you really understand a Covered Call.* You are not giving your stock away, if the Strike you sold the option at is breached you will sell the stock for the strike price. You still make money.* If the strike is breached should you buy back the option ...NEVER. But you could roll.So what do you do if the strike is breached and your stock is about to be called away.  Either let it be called away, and with the money you get either pocket it or buy back stock. OR you could roll it to a further out strike . Say you sell the 170 strike in 16 Sept for 2.20. When you are in danger of being called away (extrinsic is very low) you could try rolling it to the 180 in Oct for a credit. That means as a single trade you buy the option back AND sell the OCT 180. Only for a credit. That means if the new option in OCT is called away you get 180 which may not be what you want, but at least it will be called away for 180 and not 170.&#x200B;I would not sell options less than 30 days out, I would look to sell in the monthly options ONLY. You will get a better price, and they are more liquid. You could do a weekly, but stay at the 30 dte.  Also only sell the 30 delta or further out  (20 delta).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 06:17:22'] Do you want to keep the shares?  Or, are you willing to see them called away?The answer to this will determine how much you can earn and how to trade.  Looking at the options chain and using loose estimates, at 5% OTM this would be something like .35 or $35 per contract with about a .15 delta that is a 15% probability of being ITM and called away each week.If you want to avoid losing the shares sell 30-45 dte and close around 50% profit which will reduce the odds of the shares being called away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 09:34:34'] >Is 1-2% a reasonable goal?No. You can sanity-check any monthly return by [annualizing it](https://everydaycalculation.com/annualized-return.php) and then comparing it against a 7-10% long-term return for the broad equity market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 08:31:35'] 2,000 shares times $160 per share, so $320,000. Sell 20 call contracts, which with two days left to go for a ~5% OTM is a whopping dollar a contract, so $20 per week. Times four weeks is $80 per month. I doubt they’ll be $1 contracts if you sell at the beginning of the week, if they’re $5, you’ll make $100 per week or ~$400 per month. Not bad, but that .125% isn’t exactly close to the 2% goal. But as the others are saying, you will get them called away. But if you do, you know you’ve made 5% that week plus whatever premium you sold. I think that all should be right…
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 08:50:43'] 1-2% is aggressive and unlikely to occur.  Maybe 1%.  You might make 1-2% at times selling calls…but not robotically.  If you do it selectively and not every month, you have more winners. What are you going to do when your short call is breached?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 15:36:13'] So you think apple won’t drop ever again,,  Whst if it drops 15 percent?  How many months will it take to get to break even on your shares by making  2 percent a month.  I don’t think you’ll be even to sell calls at your cost basis if it drops 15 percent.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:37:41'] Holding period resets if you sell calls less than 30 days out. Something to keep in mind if your real goal is to keep the shares long term (since you are still vulnerable to a quick run-up).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 17:42:57'] Why tf are you just now thinking about that. You should have a Ferrari by now. Sell 30 delta otm or lower and roll it out every 30 to 60, once it hits 60% Congrats boss
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 13:19:31'] Username screams r/gamblingaddiction.Joking aside, you don't need to ask the question when you can answer it yourself. Take the premium of the call you wish to sell and divide it into the value of the stock to get the % CC max return if the stock does not move past the short call strike. What's the big deal here?The questions you are NOT asking are the ones worth answering, which are:1. Are you in a taxable account?2. Are you OK getting the stock called away and getting exposed to capital gains tax?3. Is AAPL a long term holding that you do not ever want to let go, for long term strategic reasons?4. Is this option income something you plan on using for living expenses or will you be redeploying in other trades?5. Are you set on selling CCs on AAPL or are you OK selling CCs on other underlyings which you may or may not own right now?6. Are you looking into other income strategies using options, or are you really limited to CCs only?Once you think about all of these, an entire world of options, pun intended, will open up for you, and you will probably forget about AAPL and keep it in your forever portfolio. Just my guess.Good luck with the thought process.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 21:41:59'] You stand a very good chance of getting your shares called away chasing that much premium. Your gonna have to sell ATM or barely OTM and with apple, well 🤷🏻‍♂️ Your statement was 1%-2% on weeklies do your goal is a 52%-104% gain. Lower your total % gain goal for the year from selling CC or lower your expectations you’ll get to keep your shares. Without reasonable assessment of risk and reward I just don’t see it going well for you. Good luck

I hope you bought puts on Netflix because that shit fell 10% after hours. That ... could be bad for other stocks like Apple though. Just be aware.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-20 16:02:39'] Healthy pullback. It's been on a tear since the end of March. Nothing unusual about the volume today, and it recovered.I do suspect AAPL is nearing a short-term top, and earnings might be a catalyst to drive it down for a bit. It's not any sort of bubble, and it's not substantially overvalued, but the thing's just so darn big and with such clear economics that you can only really grow the price so much at a time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-20 16:57:22'] I made the same mistake. Couple of things:1. News was already baked into price when you bought the call2. It's hard to please expectations. Anticipation, climax, release.3. Entire market dropped

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-20 13:18:20'] A great event is priced into the market's expectations. Your option is going to increase in value if the event happens to be extra great, beyond what everybody was expecting. In the event they announced slightly better products, but nothing revolutionary.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-20 16:36:33'] did you look at AAPL's previous event days? they commonly TANK on those days, and recover when investors and analysts finally put $ figures on the potentials from the announcements. i think more than half of the events they've had in the last 2-3 years have had daily drops during the events in real time.  also: 'my aapl calls (my portfolio)' - please tell me your entire portfolio doesn't consist of appl calls. unless it's a couple grand.  next time you use an extremely directional and bullish tool (call options) on its own - know that's what the tool is, and research the situation and do your diligence on the trade idea and see if plain old calls are the right type of move / strategy.

If you’re close to expiration I’d say take profits. Or set up take profit orders daily. Which with the big? On when we will see the bubble burst this might be the smartest move anyway overall. take your money off the table as much as possible and take profits as much as possible. If you have a day trading account and you can go in and out I would say be in cash overnight and stay in short options options. Keeps it cheaper anyway and less risk

Im actually happy it’s stayed rangebound this close to earnings. I don’t have access to level 2 data but my guess is that there’s a sell wall right around 135, and there would need to significant buy volume to overcome that. I’m in on Jan 22 and 23 leaps along with 3000 shares avg cost $8, so I’m in it to win it with appl. My reason for leaps is that it behaves very much like a broader market index with periods of consolidation preceding a big move up or down. We just went through a big move up, so if there are shorter dated options at stake I’d sell into earnings.

At this point in the market it needs a significant catalyst to move to the upside in a sustained manner.  Most positive news from any company has been short lived.  It would take up the stock a few days and then come down even faster.  This is the way, at this moment!  It is a stock pickers market as indexes reach ATH and then retreat.  I am looking into the other old adage, Sell in May and Go Away...I may just do that as I do see another down turn in May after April which happens to be the best month, historically, in terms of gains in the stock market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-20 20:32:35'] AAPL rallied up from its March low at $116.21 to a resistance zone at the $136.99 to $132.79 area. This is the level where AAPL began its February selloff. Also, AAPL traded above its upper Bollinger Band for 7 straight days, and ended with a Key Reversal on April 14. Both of these actions are short term Bearish indications. It’s an extreme move for a stock to trade above its upper Bollinger Band, and on a short term basis such stocks have a high probability of reverting back to the mean, or the 20-Day moving average. The current leg of AAPL’s rally began at $118.86 and reached a high of $135.53 on Tuesday morning. Based on this recent rally, AAPL can make a retracement back down to 129.16.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/y2m11d/extrinsic_value_of_selling_covered_call_options/'
POST_TEXT: b'Is there an actual way to calculate extrinsic value remaining of an option?  I have sold numerous covered calls on aapl over the past few months.  I generally have extracted good value and bought the option back early for bigger premiums. Question is: how do you decide when to roll a profitable covered call sale early into a new higher premium?   \n\nCurrently holding two:\nAapl nov18 170 call.  Premium $241.  Current $35.  85% gain - 30 days out \nSold about a month ago\n\nAapl Nov18 155 call.  Premium $354. \nCurrent $177.  50% gain - 30 days out. Sold last week'
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 18:58:40'] Out of the money calls are made up of 100% extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the greater of the value of exercising the option immediately, or zero. A $100 strike call on an asset trading for $150 has $50 of intrinsic value. This is because you could exercise the option immediately, which would give you the right the buy the asset for $100. You could then sell it right back at the market price of $150, netting you $50. Now, if that option is trading for $60, the extra $10 is the extrinsic, or time value. That extra represents the chance that by expiration, the asset could be higher than $150. For out of the money options, exercising would net you a loss, so there is no intrinsic value. The entirety of the value of the option is made up of extrinsic, or time value, representing the chance that the option could end up in the money by expiration. When to roll a covered call is up to you and depends on a lot of factors. I evaluate my positions often and ask myself if I’d put on that position now at the current price. If you’d be happy to sell that first covered call for $35 with 30dte, then keep it on. If there’s other calls you’d rather sell, buy it back and sell something else. That’s how I approach it anyways.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey All, \n\nI purchased about 12k worth of SPY 375p with an expiry of 1/19/24 about 6 weeks ago when the underlying was at 412 (average price per contract \\~12). Original thesis was that SPY had limited upside potential remaining and that this was a (relatively) safe hedge against what seemed like an inevitable correction to the downside in the not too distant future. Obviously the trade has moved against me and I'm currently sitting at about a 40% loss. I know that I have plenty of time remaining (228 days to be exact), but the bull momentum has me nervous. Should I hold tight and assume that we revisit the low 400's in time to not burn away all of the value? Thanks in advance for your input."
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 09:52:40'] I point this out to almost everyone who has far dated puts or calls:You paid extra for the far expiration. Clearly, you had a reason to do so, right? Perhaps because you wanted more time to ride out short-term downturns?If a downturn like this in your put's value wasn't accounted for in your original trade plan, why did you pay extra for a far expiration in the first place?If you are the type that gets nervous when you see a 40% or more decline as an **unrealized** loss, you probably shouldn't be trading far dated contracts. Instead, consider rolling 60 DTE puts or calls every 30 days. That way, you can adjust your position more frequently to short-term changes in the market, and you won't pay as much up front (though you may end up paying more in the long run).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:33:05'] If you bought it as a hedge against a long portfolio, the rest of your positions should be profiting. The loss on the hedge is the price you pay for the downside protection. There might be some users on here with better advice about selecting specific strikes and expiration dates for hedge positions, but overall I don't think it's bad to let these contracts stay open and keep doing their job protecting you from a sudden huge downswing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:41:41'] Close at your predetermined profit or loss target amounts to move on to the next trade.I can't tell what the market will do any more than anyone else can, so you have to follow your trading plan as it is the only way to prevent larger losses and protect profits.Has your thesis changed?  If so, then you need to reevaluate the trade based on your plan and if you would open the same trade now or not and which will help you decide what to do . . .

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:33:08'] What i’ve learned in trading is that the market is unpredictable therefore always have a stop loss in mind and act on it…it’s about capital preservation…opportunities will be plenty but you may not have the capital left so at trade entry decide on the take profit and stop loss and stick to it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:20:46'] This is the simplest answer you will find:You bought far dated Puts and far OTM. Instead should have invested in shorter and ITM the same 12k, and get out on the dump like yesterday.You should get out and accept the loss.The risk/reward ratio of those contracts is terribleSPY needs to dump 27 points for you to even make approx. +3% return on the original investment by the end of the June. After that is pure bleeding.Ask yourself this, is it worth the risk and wait?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:24:54'] One thing I've learned in my years of trading pre and post pandemic is that the bulls always win in the long term. Granted, there's been prolonged periods of decline in the history of the market. Inevitably, the bulls always win. In my eyes, even in a bear market (which S&P is inching closer to a bull market), puts are better off used in short term rather than longer term contracts. Calls, on the other hand, I find are better in long-term contracts compared to short-term contracts.The inevitably of investor greed will always push towards a bull market. It would take a pretty significant event to decrease the underlying support. Just make sure to purchase discounted contracts when you can find them. Try not to overpay for contacts, that'll just result in more losses or less profit
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 09:56:17'] I thought SPY was up because of its top stocks, but the rest is down.  That is something to keep in mind.

You made your decision on the eve of fed interest rate decisions and debt ceiling decisions that were anticipated to favor the market as the dems need the next year to look rosey before elections. I would lean towards small corrections here and there but a continued gradual increase but that's just my guess as again, the market cannot be timed.That's why selling options to gamblers is far better then gambling ourselves and taking positions. And selling many different equity positions is far better then getting straddled with one major position and having to ride it out to profit (even though SPY is one of the safest if not the safest position out there to get assigned). Should sold the CSP on it instead Sorry you got saddled mate. Hopefully it makes a sizeable near term correction so you can minimize loss on the position

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:54:35'] You mention "safe hedge". Did you open this position as a true hedge or as a speculative play? If it was a true hedge insurance policy type play, have you found the increase in your other positions are up enough to more than offset this unrealized loss? If the answer to your question requires knowing if we will revisit low 400's then there is not a person in world that can help you. However, what you may be able to seek is general ideas on how to manage positions and create good trade plans.What ever you do, I wish you good fortune.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:36:31'] Unfortunately I don’t think anyone will be able to provide helpful advice. You made a wrong bet and it is what it is, happens to everyone. No one can predict future direction of SPY either. Generally if someone purchased the same puts today, they’d also be making a new bet and hoping for some profit. While an issue for you is whether you’ll be able to recoup your original cost, even if SPY starts coming down. I can’t help much, but in terms of anyone telling you that you could’ve done it differently or better, they’d be making huge profit arbitraging between what’s “better” vs what’s “worse”, for example they could’ve been selling your puts while buying different puts and thus performing an arbitrage and getting rich. But they don’t. Basically your bet or your strategy is as good as anyone else’s.Though one obvious issue is that VIX is also going down recently (normal in slow-moving or up-trending market), and it was more risky to buy puts when VIX is high. Now would be better time to buy such puts with a little better edge due to low VIX, but of course no one knows whether one bet is better than another. Last Friday was one of the highest volume of call buying…Btw, buying less ATM puts has a slight edge over buying more OTM puts in terms of odds, though OTM puts can pay more % when SPY starts dropping.

Looking back, once that happens the 365 day line acts as support and the price typically does not fall below the line again (In 2015 it did tho)I'm near term bearish especially after todays close, but with Rates expected to stay the same or get cut and the debt ceiling resolved Spy has less reasons to be bearish in the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:41:36'] I agree with your assumption. I had to roll spy positions today but I am hopeful we will both be correct
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:56:19'] When you said hedge, what portion of your portfolio are you hedging for? Do you have 25K+ in other investments? Otherwise this is not hedging but just another directional move, IMO. A hedge would mean you have shares - that we all speculate would go up - or other bullish moves and protection that is your 12K puts. It's hard to get a win on both sides, but at least with hedging your down is limited.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 16:42:24'] I mean no one can tell you what you want to hear,that’s your puts will be profitable.However I can tell you this 12k is the most you can lose.There are plenty of reasons SPY could hit 400 or lower in the next 6 months.Do I think it will? Personally I think it will.The worst thing is to close a position for a loss that later turns into a home run.My personal belief is spy won’t see 375, 350 was the bottom,the market “wants” to go up.If I owned this position I wouldn’t close now,but I would be looking between now and 90 days to expiration to limit losses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 21:16:43'] If your thesis was a shift in sentiment at 419 level and SPY blew right past it then you should have closed it out immediately regardless of expiration date.  You can always go short at a better strike.  You were expecting it to go down at that level but it didn't.  There's a saying, "The market should have been down but it's up, so go long.  The market should have been up but it's down, so go short".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 21:50:44'] A lot of good responses. I personally would stay in because of the divergence in the spy. Let’s be honest, if it ain’t AI, it’s probably down. Perhaps as others have said, use a smaller position. You definitely earned an education from this. Best of luck to you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:03:18'] No one knows the future. But honestly, what makes you think the markets will crash and revisit 400 or less? Just look at fundamentals of the markets - inflation is slowing, the FED is pausing, earnings although lowered were still better than expected, M1 and M2 supply declining, wages growing, industrial output increasing, jobless claims declining, analysts beginning to revise their EPS estimates upward (for 2023 the expectation is +1.3%, up from -0.9%, and for 2024 +12.2%, and remember, markets are forward looking and they price in 2024 expectations already), labor market extremely strong, etc. There is simply no catalyst for the decline and whoever says otherwise is misleading himself/herself with wishful thinking. Can this all change? Of course it can, but it hasn't changed yet. This market is choppy, volatile, it maybe bouncing around, we may see pullbacks, but no matter how you spin it, it is a bullish market. So, are you willing to bet your money for a black swan event that may never come? If yes, and you really belive, this market is doomed for a decline of 300 points in the near future, stay the course and stay invested. I disagree with your thesis and if you stay in I believe you will lose money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:24:31'] All the technicals say the spy will continue to increase in price. You’ve clearly blown the trade so we will just focus on what needs be done next. Next comparable high was at 431.73 and this should be your new stop loss. Options are a derivative. Even if the price of the underlying does return someday to your strike price the value you paid may not. If spy closes at 375 on expiration day the contact is still worthless. You’re stop loss will now be 431.73. No two consecutive daily closes above that price on that chart or you should sell and hopefully walk away with half your money (-50%) Good luck OP

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 21:44:19'] If your risk is too big, just sell now. You can always re-enter a trade. Right now you’re fighting against upside momentum that just won’t quit. If, for some reason, you need to make money on the put side, I would wait to see SPY close below $419 before considering a short trade. Just guessing that the market is due for a steep drop while it continues to pop higher causes a lot of traders to blow up accounts. Respect the support and resistance levels and trade the market that’s in front of you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:52:21'] How about some math to get a better perspective: 2 out of 10 years S&P goes down, so you bet on a 20% probability of profit (not including the options probably which further reduces it).  Though note these odds shift if the previous year was a down year, to a less than 1 in 10 probability.However, 92% of the time S&P gap fills.  There is a gap from last Friday.  So there is over a 90% chance SPY will go down to $423, but a less than 10% chance it will continue going down lower than that.Sorry, but you're going to have to eat it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 16:48:53'] A couple of things to consider:1.  your trade is probably too large.2. you have a ton of time.Some ideas -- \-- Close the position\-- Sell some closer dated puts against the long puts\-- do a combination of both.\-- buy some SPY shares against the long puts. (probably the worst option)&#x200B;Any time i have a long options position I try to have a short position against it to offset any negative theta decay I can.  Also, your comment 'Original thesis was that SPY had limited upside potential remaining and that this was a (relatively) safe hedge against what seemed like an inevitable correction to the downside in the not too distant future.' is something you should really examine.  \*IF\* you are concerned that you're getting smoked to the tune of a 40% loss on a 'safe hedge,' then you really didn't look at this as a hedge at all.  It may help to get a view of your total overall deltas of your portfolio, and then look at how the long SPY puts impact that delta.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 11:16:18'] I would say hold and wait, we SHOULD be due for a correction soon, but the market isn’t always rational. I definitely could see SPY coming back down to the 400s over the next couple months. You have the time in the contracts, theta shouldn’t be a big impact right now. Also, did you have a stop loss or exit plan before entering the trade? Incase something like this did happen? Always have an exit plan for when a trade goes against you. Figure out your exit plan before entering the position. What is the most you are willing to lose if your thesis is proven incorrect.Not financial advise

I'm no perma bull but I wouldn't bet SPY to get there. Random guess with no research and I'm not an expert, Maybe 405 (really pushing it) in that timeline, but I'd feel safer at 410 in that timeline. On the high though, I think we might see 450 within that timeline. And despite all the economic issues we have, I think we are going to trend upward between now and then. One thing I've really learned in the last year is the saying "Buy the rumor and sell the news" is really true. And I'll add, "The market is short term illogical, long term logical." So maybe in the long run you'll be right. I'm well regarded though so there is that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 16:32:20'] For long term puts/hedge I feel going even deeper OTM is best. The lower delta and gamma will not hurt as bad when on a uptrend, but you still have significant downside protection. Also less theta which is always good!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:39:04'] What was your goal? To buy life insurance for your portfolio in case of a catastrophic correction or to speculate on the underlying’s movement? If it is the former, you paid your insurance premium to sleep better at night. It’s job is not to make money, but to be the one that does not collapse when everything else does. You went quite a bit OTM and it is not impossible they will be worthless. If your goal was to make money, you are pretty much in damage control mode right now. If the expiration was not so far away, you could correct this position expanding it into a butterfly spread where this position is the lowest leg, but with 6+ months to expiration it would be an even worse move. If this was a speculative investment, you may have to get ready to the idea of eating a sizable loss.

POST_TEXT: b'Yesterday, I replied to a post (on TTG) where the OP was struggling with what to do on a covered call that had gone in the money. My reply was "I\'m always surprised people don\'t do Iron Condors in place of covered calls" which sparked a bit of a discussion. I thought the discussion was worth a longer post and a bigger discussion here.\n\n**Covered calls** are like an entry drug for options. They are extremely straightforward and serve a very useful purpose. That intended purpose looks like this: 1) an investor owns the stock 2) they\'d be willing to sell it higher. 3) If they sell OTM calls they have the chance to lower their cost basis before eventually being called away in the stock. 4) IOW, for those wanting to sell stock higher, a covered call strategy is a lot smarter than a GTC sell order in the stock.\n\nWhere covered calls get misused (IMHO) is as income generation against long stock.

They sell the Apple May 21st 115/120/140/145 Iron Condor at 1.50I always thought 180 was MORE THAN 150.Your own example goes against the point you are trying to make.  You get less premium, you pay higher fees (4 legs instead of 1) and you still have no downside protection of the stock drops.  Actually, you increase your risk because if the short put is ITM at expiration but the long put isn't (pin risk) you wind up being assigned (buying) another 100 shares of stock.Another thing against your argument, is that by selling just the CC, if that large move takes place you could buy the CC back, or you could buy 100 shares to replace the ones being called away.And unless there is a huge, monster gap up, you very likely could buy back the CC or buy 100 shares before the price ever gets to 140.Your sold call spread is essentially a 120 CC and the purchase of 100 shares at 140.Lastly, selling the CC and selling either a csp or a put spread would bring in that additional premium, and result in a higher gain than the ic you proposed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 09:37:43'] >A covered call is often thought of as a bullish strategy. is it? always seemed like a pretty neutral play to me. good for pulling some money out of stock you own during a runup that you anticipate will have a pullback. i was never a fan of the 'income strategy' take on it (timing is everything) but even that seems pretty neutral to me. unless you're trying to unload your shares. that's a whole other situation. and bearish.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 09:27:40'] I've never tried owning a stock and selling a credit spread on it. Atm, I'm doing 0dte on spy. I understand I have to put up $100 collateral for a 1 width but when you own the stock, what is the collateral there? Especially selling 2 credit spreads, one call one put. I noticed you're width is 5 so are you putting up $500 collateral for each of your credit spreads?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:15:45'] I don't think of covered calls as income, I think of them as lowering my cost basis
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:47:12'] I run covered calls on almost everything I own. The thing posters of these types of posts forget is that you can almost always roll the call forward at or near expiration, and you will always receive more credit premium in the roll.Sometimes I am able to roll it forward, AND upward by $0.50 or $1 or more depending on the volatility of the options and how pricey the weeks or months ahead options are.I ran into this a month ago with NIO. I bought on the dip, but then sold $35 calls to generate income. When it shot up before the end of the day I decided to roll that call a week forward by a $1 upwards, and keep the shares. I eventually sold the shares much higher than that original call price, but kept rolling the calls until it turned a profit. In almost exactly a month, I was able to roll the call strike all the way up to $40 without losing any shares on the way, and added a great deal to the bottom line.The shares I had sold at $38, and the calls today expired worthless because they never got to $40.I agree with statements in principle that if you're 100% bullish then you don't sell covered calls, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how bullish YOU are on a stock, it still moves around, up and down, sometimes sideways. Profiting off the time element of options is profit pure and simple. Sure, you have to manage it, but its not bearish to use CCs in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 09:45:19'] TLDR: did you factor in trading fees? My options fees are expensive. Moving from a basic covered call to a more involved spread typically eats up my profit
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:52:18'] Covered call is bullish with downside protection. If you're betting on the stock moving outside 1 weekly/monthly std, that's a losing bet. Now LEAPS are another story. Owning the stock and selling a credit spread could be seen as a bullish/neutral strategy.You're subject to more severe losses if the stock goes down outside of the strikes. Also depending on how wide your wings are, the losses can be very, very, very severe.I still remember on the stock sub how a guy posted about owing his broker 180k because he had sold a wide iron condor before linkedin earnings and they had tanked to 100 bucks. He stood to make something like 10-15k at the time but he got eviscerated. Let's be honest here, you're talking about opportunity cost when you discuss 'losses' on a cc from the upside, but losses on an iron condor and butterfly are very real and very much not in the form of potential gains you cut yourself off from.I would say the safest out of all these are selling cash secured puts.For me, the appeal of the iron condor, or trading any spread lies in its ability to provide an enormous amount of leverage and the insane amount of premium you can collect when iv is very high, but saying iron condors are a 'better' strategy seems really misleading, implying they're less risk, more reward, higher chance of success and such. So much more goes into it.Less risky than a cc I'd say is a Pmcc which there was a great post someone made here earlier on that strategy.Why is pmcc not recommended by you recommend iron condor + hold?You could argue pmcc does the same thing but with significantly less downside risk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:00:22'] This is an interesting read because as a newcomer I've been selling mostly CCs on stock I own or LEAPS. I realized they limited my upside potential but wanted something relatively safe to learn with.However, I'm running my first iron condor (technically iron butterfly) hoping for neutral movement in ZNGA. Regardless of how that works out, the experience doing a more complex strat makes me a feel a little more comfortable doing more.I can't afford to do one on AAPL but the condorr vs CC is worth considering.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:04:09'] IC has a $3.50 loss where as CC being called away has NO loss. Not undefined. the shares are exercised away at a profit and the call premium is kept. it’s a capped profit with no loss. You need to state things as factually precise as possible. Exiting a covered call at a loss is a new trade whereas the $3.50 loss is inherent in your existing trade.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:13:16'] Doesn’t this require additional capital to cover the put credit side of the trade? Could make it a less useful strategy for smaller accounts

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:21:43'] In general, a covered call should be used for short- and mid-term bullish plays, with the call set at the point where you'd be happy to sell because you'd consider it overvalued or overbought. AAPL is in a good spot for that if you're a technical analysis sort of person: buy it now, set your covered call to 145, the 52-week high and where 14-day RSI is at 80%. If it gets there, hooray! You didn't want the shares anyway, you expect it to go down, and you just got the maximum profit available.If you're in AAPL for the long haul, ownership + credit/short iron condor is more bullish than a Covered Call, but part of why is because it doesn't hedge against bearish surprises. In your example, a decline to $115 produces: * $1,320 loss for 100 shares @ 130 plus covered call @ 140* $1,848 loss for 100 shares\* @ 130 plus short iron condor 115/120/140/145*\* One nice thing about iron condors is that you don't need coverage for them at all, so you can own any number of shares here, including zero.*Obviously, a person who is bullish does not expect a bearish surprise. But it's still a risk. A covered call limits max profit with a bullish surprise, but it also hedges against all forms of bear movement. Ownership + short iron corridor hedges against normal bear movements, but it magnifies losses from a bearish surprise.Personally, I think you're right about AAPL at the moment, and the better play here is the iron condor. But the investor needs to factor in their expectation of, and tolerance for, the risk of a bearish surprise.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:21:34'] Thanks for your post, very interesting to see the direct comparison. I've been wanting to trade iron condors but I'm still liquidating some older stocks to move over to tastyworks. Anyway, I still have four questions which I need to research and which I struggle with even when doing paper trades. 1.What indicators should a stock have to be a good candidate for iron condors?2. How wide should the spread between the legs be?3. How far out do I choose the legs?(DTE)4. How and when do I close the positions?Yeah, I got some ways to go.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:57:39'] I’m still working through the whole post and all the information (and I’m also not that experienced of an options trader compared to many), but it seems to me that comparing CCs to Iron Condors is apples to oranges. The actual risk with a covered call is zero. You’re covered. Your “risk” is losing the opportunity for gains. You’re not risking any of your actual money. An Iron Condor is different because it may limit your risk, but it’s an actual risk. Your money that you already own will be removed from your possession the underlying moves more than you’ve guessed it would. So you’re really comparing a theoretical loss to an actual loss, right?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:59:14'] Covered call is best seen as measure to lock in your profits and is something you can do over and over again irrespective of the price. Its a defensive and prudent strategy which generally works well when you intend to hold the actual stock. Also high beta stocks are obviously more rewarding given the high implied volatility in the calls one sells.A debit call spread would invariably be better as a short term bullish strategy.  Theres one caveat with iron condors on stocks, they underlying say for instance AAPL may have a significant move in either one direction and would wipe out the previous gains, unless one is quick to make adjustments. IMO, Iron condors are better with indices and despite lower IV, because you are unlikely to lose in a covered call if you intend to hold the stock for say 5 years but iron condors actually can leave you in loss if a high beta stock goes either way, of course the loss will still be capped and known to you beforehand. TLDR: Covered call would cut you off your profit at the worst and iron condors would give you a predetermined loss at worst.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:29:40'] I learned the same lesson w/ apple shares as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 10:50:50'] I disagree and primarily from experience. When you sell a covered call you are now the house vs degenerate gamblers and the house always wins. What is missing here is that you sell your calls out 1 month. If it gets in the money you simply roll out another month and collect EVEN MORE PREMIUM. You might be thinking how is that possible? IV is the answer. When IV goes up ALL the call prices go up and since a call premium is really just buying “time” that same “time” value is equally stupid high every month you go out. No stock goes up forever. I did this on MP materials for example which I plan to hold for years to come. Started selling covered calls on it for about 3 months now and my average share cost is down around 5 bucks/share. Its actually easier than most people think to do this, but for some reason people are one dimensional and get froze in the headlights when their call gets in the money the only thing preventing them from rolling up and out is greed they will keep the entire premium

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:16:49'] Thanks , very well explained! People usually don't think it's a loss when stock goes above CC price because money wasn't owned. But loss is harder because we can see RED.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:02:13'] isn't the advantage of cc the fact that they only have opportunity costs as long as the underlying moves up and with the iron condor you have actual losses
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:21:07'] The problem is as always, that people get too greedy!If you sell covered calls, sell them at a point where you are actually comfortable with letting go.  Would I sell apple for 150 right now? One hundred percent? Will this give me a juicy 3%yield every month? Of course not!That is the trade-off!

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:48:02'] They work for me.  I generate income and by more shares.  I’ll get called out of AAPL today.  Been holding and selling weekly calls for a couple weeks.  In this account, I had 263.. shares.  I’ll look to sell puts until put.  But if it drops and rebounds and I’m not put, I may buy/write.   I’m doing this with 20-30 stocks a week.  Some low volume are monthly like T and VZ.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:42:20'] I use covered calls as a secondary income. I'll use one of my holdings as an example. I hold Vale long term. It pays a dividend and I like what it produces long term. I sell covered calls 1.50 to 2.00 above stock price either weekly or biweekly. I wait until RSI/stochastics go above overbought lines on tradingview to do it. When doing covered calls for income. You want to do it on stock you plan on holding for a long time. If you are getting your shares called away more than a few times a year, you are doing it wrong. AAPL price moves more, but the example still stands. You should be selling covered calls way OTM. Multiple strike prices away with short durations.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:21:22'] Indeed it is a fallacy to say that covered calls are good at income generation. Just look at any the CBOE buy-write indexes (BXM, BXMC, BXMD) to see proof of that. Compared to just holding SPY, writing covered calls severely limits your upside in the long run unless you can time the market perfectly. Calling them an income generator is simply a marketing gimmick.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:31:06'] WTF? a Covered call is a bullish play? Not at all. Lets be clear here about what I am saying. A Covered Call, is a Bearish Play. After all your expectation is the stock will end below the strike price you are selling for. That your call is covered does not change selling calls from Bear to Bull, you have simply hedged the risk that the stock will runaway leaving you with massive losses.I disagree with the author that an Iron Condor is a better play, because it requires more legs, has risk on both sides of the trade and is suitable for stocks that won't wander out of the range. Vertical Spread better represents recapture of most the profits should the stock catapult past your strike significantly.  To reduce losses to theta the higher strike call should be done further out in time, and rolled forwards to be no closer than two weeks where theta really begins eating larger chunks on a daily basis.  You then sell the weeklies, near the money where theta loss should be highest and profits greatest because of the potential for being ITM. If you feel the need to protect against loss you can buy Puts, but there is little point to doing so unless there is a high risk of falling, why? Because if the stock is falling, the value of the covered call is acting like a makeshift put. If it falls enough you can close that position and open a new one closer to ITM to continue capturing money on the way down.If you so mistrust your stock that you need two levels of puts (selling one strike and buying another) I would suggest you are in this case either overly risk adverse or you don't trust the stock you are in to retain its value, which is another matter. Any drop in value if you are a long term holder, will be covered by the income generation of selling the covered calls, and should they be called away on a large move you have the purchased calls to ensure that you are not out too much. Just one man's opinion. I like Iron Condors, but I think they are for stocks with small volatility, which already means limited income generation for the risk of being called away in the first place.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:48:57'] So I ran up on a weird occurrence on Monday. I found an iron condor with a decent spread on GME with zero max loss and $225 gain. I didn’t pull the trigger because I have never done an iron condor on stocks that are that HTB. Besides a Friday pin risk what other risks do I face on that trade? Or was it a good trade? I have seen videos of Kirk from options alpha doing the same but he turned a spread into one on a tech stock. If someone decides to exercise their option will it always automatically execute the full leg on the fallowing day or is their a pin risk like on Friday.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:01:48'] I agree on some of this and here is why...no longer a noob but not and expert I am somewhere in between.  My skills are not so good that I can accurately place condors for income.  So I typically do just do vert spreads.  I agree that credit spreads are a great income strategy and as you progress and become a lot better condors work great as well.  I do play condors closer to expiration since less time volatility and the ability to practice and if I screw up I am not losing a lot.  If someone is doing covered calls, they probably are not yet at the level of doing condors and therefore need to practice and build up to that point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:34:46'] I'll start by saying I agree with you.  I will add that spreads and ICs are usually a more efficient use of capital as your outlay is usually less. However, there is also diversification of strategies to consider. I have different pools of money that I use for different strategies. One of the reasons I write CC's is that I own the asset (underlying) and if the CC moves against me, I still own the asset and that safety is worth something (for me). This is only really important if you're writing calls on rock solid companies. If a spread or IC moves against me I can try and manage the trade but that still may not always work in my favor. You were right in saying that CC's are entry level, and it's because they are simple and sometimes I really like simple.  To add to the other discussion on the thread on sentiment for CC's, they are absolutely bullish, just not as bullish as backing up the truck on a bunch of long call weeklies:)
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:38:33'] Wouldn’t it cost $1,000 (not $10) to buy back the covered call if the price hit $150 and the buyer exercised?[($150 current price - $140 strike) *100 shares]
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:41:40'] Covered calls can be bearish neutral or bullish tbh. The major things to consider are whether you want to hold the stock long term and what the premiums are, and the strike price. For example, I could buy 100 shares of Tesla and sell a covered call a month out for 10%+ premium. If the shares get called away maybe im ok with that because I think its overvalued. If they don’t get called away I’m ok holding TSLA long-term anyway and can sell another call if I wish. However take GME as an example. You could buy 100 shares at 160 and sell a call with a strike price of 100 one month out. This is very bearish but isnt as risky as buying a put and usually yields more premium than selling a put. It also allows you to keep the stock if you want to if it drops below 100. So it acts very much like a more bullish cash-covered put in this instance.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:54:55'] > A covered call is often thought of as a bullish strategy. I disagree. It's considered a "conservative" strategy, but it's best used in range-bound stocks - which AAPL is not. To make things worse, stock like AAPL that just go up and up have very little IV, so you don't even get a good price for selling the call. And don't even get me stated on how expensive this can be in a cash account after taxes.

If you own anything outside of the Top 10 weighted in the QQQ .. or TSLA .. probably a safe play.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:48:57'] Nice. But I assume PMCC is essentially different because it can gradually pull your cost basis down?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:53:20'] I feel like Bullish and Bearish are more how you feel owning a stock and how your outlook on it is. Options are ways to try to predict movement and utilize the market fluctuations to your benefit. I can see both of your positions on this and you both have strong opinions and ultimately neither of you are wrong. Just like nobody else can tell you about your sexual preferences or political preferences another person cannot define why you make a particular play when it comes to options. You both make amazing points and are both deploying methods that work for you. Who cares what the UNDERLYING SENTIMENT of it is. Bearish or Bullish as long as it’s making GREEN that’s all that matters. Carry on making money gentlemen.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:59:13'] This is an interesting point. I appreciate the time you took to help educate others. Two points I want to bring up that to hope will help the both of us (and others) continue to learn. Keep in mind I am not questioning your knowledge, but will be trying my best to write this in a manner others can follow. 1) This does seem to be the better play for a bullish outlook (as you stated.) But, it does seem to increase your potential losses. Where as a CC can be closed early and repositioned in down trends to increase premium. Now that is not to say CC is still the optimal trade here. Just a consideration for people to take in. 2) You mentioned assignment of a CC caps profits (and it does). But if you want to get back into the position, you could wait for a small dip and sell a shorter expiry ITM CSP (in the money cash secured put).If it continues to moon, you collect a thick premium. If you are assigned, the premium will help further lower your cost basis and restart the cycle. - there is obviously no best method that works in every scenario. But just some food for thought for the poster and any on-lookers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 14:14:55'] Agree with most of your assessment and summary, but a few more considerations:CC's are an entry-level investment strategy that require very little management, and have virtually no risk other than a pullback in long stock, which are the same risks in owning just long stock.IC's are far more difficult to understand, require complex management (rolling, hedging, etc.), and carry pin risk, early assignment risk on your short PUTs, or major black swan events (think: Covid).
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 14:28:39'] Thanks for this.  Regardless of Bulls or Bears, more of us are better off understanding additional moves we can make.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 14:43:36'] Why dont you rollover when call is itm maybe like calendar spread so that you get loss premium with increase time value. In this way you keep the stock and dont need to sell stock as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 15:02:39'] I'll share a recent example of where covered calls helped me out, feel free to give feedback or ask questions.I was long about $200k worth of Goldman Sachs with a long-term horizon, had bought in at just below the high (around $344-ish).  The stock retreated back to the $330 range and traded as low as $318. This could be due to yields, or Archegos, or just a normal correction. I was down, and my normal strategy would be to ride it out and wait for it to come back up.  I knew earnings are due on 4/20, and confident the price would recover in Q2.But I wondered if I could speed that up.   Noting that the stock was stuck in a new sideways pattern between $320-330, I also noticed that calls for this stock were fetching very good prices, even in the 2-4 week range. This was likely because of the recent runup which had now run out of gas.Rule 1: When a stock's volatility suddenly decreases, i.e., it takes a rest, there's a few week period where options are overpriced. I sold covered calls (4/16 expiry) at 335 strike against part of my long position while the stock was trading around 330, collecting around $4500 in premium.At the same time, I also sold off some of my long shares at 330 and bought them back same day in the low $320s, lowering my basis.  The stock has refused to go much higher, but there is a decent intra-day volatility between $320-330.  My new basis is now below $335 on the total position. Rule 2:  Get paid while you wait for something you expect to happen, to happen. Today GS closed around $331. It's starting to come back. The covered call has increased in value of course (hope its one of you lucky bastards).  If the price gets to $335 I'll get exercised, but I'll be ahead by about $10k when that happens.   Then I'll buy back in and start all over again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 15:22:49'] You have an interesting idea, but I don't think your strategy is correct. A covered call is specifically used to lower cost basis to collect premium without requiring any more capital. Doing an iron condor adds cost to your shares. This is a big factor in why you do a covered call because it does not add capital requirements. Next, iron condors are specific to being neutral on a stock. A covered call can be seen as a bearish-neutral trade. Iron condors can end up losing you money if it trades outside the wings past breakeven, thus giving you a loss in any direction. Which leads to the next point: the covered call overall makes you money no matter what direction it goes (the max profit is only capped).You also forgot to mention the possibility of rolling the covered call hedge up and/or out to collect even more premium. This is options management 101. You don't need to buy it back and take a loss.The next BIG thing is, why the hell would you do an iron condor on a stock just because you own it? Owning the underlying doesn't affect the iron condor. You're better off using that capital on a stock you found that fits short option strategies (high liquidity, high IV, neutral assumption, etc.).Summary:* CC: hedge, win-win up or down, requires no extra capital, can manage/roll* IC: for profit taking, requires capital, neutral trade and loses when outside breakevens, requires option strategies, can't roll well, underlying stock doesn't help to own it

(Short a call and long stock is a synthetic put )"I have been arguing essentially the same thing here for a couple hours with a handful of people who insist that because they are LONG the stock, that the act of selling the Call is somehow BULLISH. Well I am done, I will make this one last final message, point to this excellent update and rest.Yes because you have the shares you are bullish on the stock, but the act of the short call is bearish on PRICE.Though I am curious how is 10 covered calls on 1000 shares only 5 synthetic puts and 5 calls rather than being 10 synthetic puts? I thought it was one sold call plus 100 stock (hedge) was a synthetic put.[https://investingwithoptions.com/covered-call/](https://investingwithoptions.com/covered-call/)\_\_\_ You shiould trade covered calls if you are bullish on the stock and  bearish on the volatility, and don't mind having similar risk as if you  were just long stock.### Why You Don't Trade Covered CallsIf you think the stock is due for a huge move, you shouldn't trade  covered calls. This is both to the upside and downside. If the stock is  about to crash, then you don't need the large downside exposure-- and if  the stock is about to rip higher, you don't want to cap your gains.Covered calls are a bearish volatility strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:47:08'] Three points:1. To me an OTM covered call is short-term bearish but long-term bullish.  You think the stock is going to go up long-term but short-term either the market or the individual stock is going sideways between now and expiration.2. If the stock does go up, it is not the end of the world because you can do a diagonal roll to a later date and higher strike price.  Probably best to do that as soon as you see it going ITM so its not too expensive to cover, and you may even have a net gain when you roll.3. If you are trading in an IRA you may be limited on the options level and not have a choice but to use covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:30:44'] Thanks, I have been actually trying to learn more on the iron condor today. New to investing. What happens when one of your calls or puts gets exercised?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:44:35'] Covered Call is a feel-good strategy. Psychologically, you just cannot lose (if you are an optimist).1. Stock goes nowhere. Yay, you get to keep the entire premium.2. Stock goes down. Yay, you would have lost more if you did not sell some calls.3. Stock goes up. Yay, you just made some money!IMO it has a place only if you already own a stock that you are unwilling to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:57:20'] The downside of being long on a stock, let's say, holding 5-10 years, selling CCs and if they move ITM, rolling them out and up, ad infinitum? Make CC premium, lower cost basis, roll to keep a hold on stock as it rises. Understanding that even AAPL takes a breather now and then, giving you a chance to catch up with your ITM CC rolling out and up.Am I wrong with this thought?I understand CC premium will be minimal having to roll over and over until you catch up, but gainz are gainz and you get to keep the stock you want to keep.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 18:28:54'] I've done CCs mostly when I get assigned for my cash covered puts. Just keep lowering the cost. I usually set the same or higher price as I did for my puts.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 19:33:50'] I really don’t see the need to compare covered calls and IC. I think the OP post is clean and his examples are clear but I still don’t like the comparison. So I would like to simplify this to beginners like me, if you own a 100 shares and sell covered calls, good for you keep collecting premium, but if the stock rises (let’s say $10 above your strike) and they get called, you have two options ...1) you are out of the trade profitable, move on and start your next trade. 2) if you are one of those people (negative thinking) :) who gonna beat themselves for that $10 you could’ve made, then go ahead and use the IC and take more risks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 19:52:23'] Yes, in the same way you use cash secured puts : you use it to reduce cost basis when buying the business you really like, not to earn monthly income, earning monthly income is just a side bonus of selling options. The main purpose should still remain purchasing or selling of equity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 20:29:40'] Why not just roll the covered call forward and up when the stock runs past the strike at which you have written the call?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 20:30:31'] As a beginner I think I will stick with covered calls for now. Too many ways to mess up with an iron condor if you don’t now what you’re doing. This example has 5 transactions instead of one sell to open order for covered calls. Maybe this is something I can try in the future as comfort level increases:

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 21:23:57'] I always just roll my call if it's in the money or close until it dips, there's always a dip. And if you want to move the strike price up you can pay a little or move the date out enough to get a little credit. IMO the risk of missed gains is better than the risk of lost capital. But that's a preference and the underlying point is don't sell calls on a long term hold pick another stock and run the wheel

So I know someone made a similar thread recently, but I wanted to ask this too along with some caveats.\n\nSo I recently was assigned on an AAPL put I sold and I was actually happy to just keep the shares. I love the stock long term. But I figured why not just sell calls weekly anyway. I can bring in a couple thousand bucks a year even if I'm being super cautious and conservative.\n\nBUT in that other thread, everyone was warning the person to not do it.  Because eventually you'll have your shares called away and be very unhappy.\n\nIs that really that much of a concern though? Yes, I'd be very annoyed if that happened, but I think it's pretty unlikely. I monitor my options daily anyway, and I'll just be sure to roll it up and out each week if I'm even REMOTELY worried about my shares being called away (like I just did on this past Thursday).\n\nSo, those of you who are more experienced, should I stop being cute and just keep my shares and cut it out?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 11:16:27'] Investors hold stocks for growth.  Covered call selling achieves income and possibly some growth if the short calls are OTM.      So what do you want, income or growth? If you want growth, don't sell covered calls.  If you want the income, accept the fact that sometimes, you're going to be assigned and lose the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 10:30:54'] It depends on what your long term plans are for AAPL.  I have been selling CC with my shares and I wouldn't be heart broken if they do get called away.  I once made the very foolish mistake of buying back a CC option for a loss when APPLE was rallying.  Had I waited the shares fell back down and at the time of expiration would have been well outside the money.  So I lost on both the option and the underlying shares...  what I learned is that it's really important to have a plan for all outcomes and stick to it.  I don't sell CC now unless I'm willing to part with the stock.  Same goes, that I don't sell puts unless I'm willing to hold the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 09:10:36'] Profit matters. Called or not - just an instrument.Are you happy with your weekly calls profit? If yes - do it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 10:42:55'] I sell weeklies on Apple, I have made profits and lost on some. I think overall I am up on Apple. Just sell super OTM (like .10 delta) and monitor it. Just know you might not win them all, but you can make some decent money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 09:45:02'] You are worried about having your shares called away for profit and having to sell puts for profit again?You set the price of these options. As long as you are not setting them for less than what you paid or are willing to pay you cannot theoretically lose money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 11:50:26'] I think the biggest risk is looking back 2 years from now and realizing you could have made a lot more money by not selling the covered calls. You're basically betting that the share price of Apple will go anywhere except quickly up. You can't always roll up and out for a credit and trading on such a short expiration will force you to roll more often. Covered Calls aren't some secret market edge, there's a cost and a benefit just like anything else. That said, I don't think it's a foolish thing to do, just need to understand the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 15:55:04'] I've been selling CCs on AAPL for about 3 years now. I would have made more just holding the shares and not selling options on it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 11:12:42'] Well if there are big moves in the stock, you're either getting shares called away(hopefully above the put you sold so you don't lose money) you start chasing to the down side. I personally like the strategy, but i try to only sell in overbought conditions to keep stocks for as long as possible.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 10:33:58'] Definitely don't do it on long-term AAPL. I've been screwed so many times doing that. I've held AAPL since $20 and keep thinking "I'll just make a few bucks a month by selling waaay-OTM covered calls." Funny how often those waaaay-OTM calls go ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 12:25:33'] Most who post this question are adamant that they absolutely never want to lose the shares!  If this is the case, they do lose some control as you give up the right to the shares which can be called away at any time.  The odds of this actually occurring are small, and with proper management to roll out and keep a good amount of time plus extrinsic value there is little chance the share will be called away.If you'll only be "very annoyed" if the shares are called away meaning it would not be the end of the world to you, then the extra premium will likely be well worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 12:33:46'] If they get called away it's because there was an unexpected move up.Examine why the move occurred and if it wasn't something that drastically increased the value of the company, sell puts at the same strike as the calls that got exercised and hopefully buy back at the same price that you sold after aapl reverts back to the mean.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 10:12:07'] Every single time i try to sell CCs i either lose my shares or end up buying them back at a loss.  There must be an art to this game but i havent found it
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 12:01:29'] Would it be a better idea to sell puts instead? I'm literally wondering for my own benefit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 13:10:38'] I would continue to sell CC, but I've noticed that there really isn't much premium in Apple to make it worthwhile for true profitability.Just as long as you sell the call for above your cost then you should  be good....its still profit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:28:50'] I did that for a while. I didn’t do it every week though. Sometimes premiums weren’t worth the risk of losing the shares. I’m not holding aapl anymore. I sold a few days before it shot up to the 170’s 😜. (It’s alright I made up what I left on the table elsewhere).
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:45:22'] The danger is that most stocks most of the time make thier most gains and loses during shirt periods of time. IE stock X may be up 43% under, but if you didn't own it for just just its best 2 or 3 weeks of the year, you'd be flat or only up a little in many cases. So, by selling your upside for a guaranteed profit, you lose that opportunity. Its unlikely you would do better than by just holding the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 15:58:41'] Sell the covered calls and if they get called away sell a cash secured put at or below the strike price of the covered call you sold, or at a price you are willing to buy back in. When the stock dips and you are assigned then you will buy the shares back. Rinse and repeat. - aka Wheeling a stock. r/thetagang
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 16:04:26'] take money when its on the table. Reduce risk whenever you can.Loving a stock long term is not a reason to not take profit. this is trader bias.think of all the people who liked ge,lehman, grpn, etc long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 18:00:33'] I’m not an options trader by any means but if you want to hold Apple long term, why not sell low delta stuff pretty far out the money on Green Days and if you’re really bullish just sell at the money puts on down days or at strikes that that are say, close to the 30 or 50 DMA?Guess more generally why do you not hear moreabout people who never want to sell a stock, selling puts instead? Can understand if you’re on a cash account and have to have the capital tied up which you wouldn’t want but naked? Is that a no go? You’d have to sell a stock maybe you like less at a loss to cover if you got assigned? Rambling, apologies here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 18:19:26'] [removed]
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 19:53:45'] If your shares get called away just start selling cash secured puts again!
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 20:23:58'] I struggle with this all the time. One thing you also have to consider is the cost of short vs long term capital gains. In the long run I think I will stop selling weeklies on my Apple. It is just too stressful to be honest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 21:10:11'] Don’t get greedy. If not confident walk away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 21:38:40'] Since you own the shares, and monitor daily, collect the premiums. Personally, I think it not worth the risk to sell naked calls.And if I had the buying power, and wanted more stock, I'd sell naked or cash covered puts, too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 05:21:30'] I do it weekly on Apple, and others with high premiums like AMD, Abbvie, Chevron, etc. I sell way out of the money calls and collect a small premium. For the year, it I would say I've had 80% expire worthless, 20% I've had to buy back. In general I've generated a few K in passive income, while keeping the stock. It does make for a fun Friday afternoon. People say it's high risk, I've not found that to be the case. Some weeks like this week AMD calls I sold are eating my lunch at $160 strike, but that's how it goes.It's a good low risk way to learn about options trading. If your stock gets called away at a higher price than you paid, so be it.Is it worth it? That depends on you. For me, $100-200 a week in passive income, and the learning experience is.Most recently, I've started selling 30-60 day out calls on stocks with less premium/volitality. We shall see how that goes. (Verizon, Cisco, Intel.) Was not a good time to sell against Cisco and and Intel. :)
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 12:21:11'] I really don't understand these conversations??? What is the risk????? How many times does AAPL gap up to a point were it is not feasible to just buy it back within the week???? or even immediately in the after-market (if you have the cash)... Who cares if they get called away???????? It's not AMC or NVDA or MSFT, meaning it's not about to go on some $15 dollar ride (in either direction!) unless the market itself is going on a $15 ride.... and even if it does, that happens what??? twice a year?AAPL is one of the most boring stocks I have ever seen for a company so large and popular.  You can skateboard on their chart. "Great company, shit stock"
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 13:06:57'] Keep wheeling
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 09:27:21'] One note, you need to sell your calls at least 30 days out if you wanna eventually take advantage of long term capital gains. Otherwise each call will reset your clock essentially, even if never assigned IIRC. I made this mistake this year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 11:23:09'] I did it. Assigned put. Lasted maybe three weeks writing covered calls before stock lifted off and i got called away about $8 lower.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 13:36:07'] In my taxable account, I have held on to shares.In my 401k and IRA I consistently sell covered calls. If it gets called away, fine, I can start over and buy stock again. Overall, I think I would have been better off just holding and there are times when stock pulls back and there can be sideways movement with not much premiums to sell calls to cover at least cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 13:45:01'] AFAIC .. buying the stock vs selling covered calls is solely affecting  exit of that position. If you buy the stock and it crashes you have some time .. minutes maybe, to exit the position with something intact. But.. if you sell a covered call .. you can't sell those shares until the covered has been bought back. And while that should be easy to do if the stock crashes the volatility and potentially liquidity of it may make it more expensive than you think.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:00:19'] Selling calls against a stock reduces your short term volatility and long term return. It isn’t some extra money. It’s LESS risky than just holding shares and offers LOWER returns in the long run. There is no free lunch.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:11:44'] Can’t be married to your stock if you running the wheel on it. Eventually it will be called away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:21:28'] You can sell deep OTM calls with a 0.2 delta or something as a better hedge against massive upswings, but, you'll definitely have your shares called away someday unless you barely want to make anything off of the calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:36:24'] No because short term capital gains.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 16:51:34'] AAPL will be used to hold the market when everything else selling off. Same way they can buy AAPL and squeeze the market. you must carefully watch the delta. If you think your covered calls will be in the money , sell ITM puts to offset your delta.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 17:16:38'] Yes. Foolish. I have been holding 500 shares since $24 and have no desire to sell. Had been selling .10 Delta CCs at 45 DTE or so for like .25. Collecting $125 on 5 contracts thinking I was pretty safe from assignment. The last time, and final time I did this was about 6 weeks ago or so when AAPL was trading at $150. I sold 5 $175 calls. “No way it goes up 17% in 30 days.”  Well it did, and I was looking at a $20k tax bill if assigned, or buy it back for a $2k loss, when stock was at $180 with a few days to go. I got lucky and stock dropped by expiration. Upside: $125Downside: $20k tax bill or $2k loss(At one point)I got lucky. Don’t do it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 18:13:57'] I've done it very sparingly and very conservatively.  I only did 2 this year.  The last one was when it hit $182 I did one at $195 strike.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 22:25:03'] I sell calls on any stock I buy... but typically will only buy stock if my put gets assigned so it doesn't matter if I lose the shares as I am a pure premium trader.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 07:32:30'] For the last year, the pattern with Apple has been that they have a huge run up prior to earnings, then their earnings blow away everyone's expectations, but for some reason the stock drops $10 over the next week.I don't understand it.But yeah, I'd sell.  Of course, this will probably be the one that breaks the pattern and Apple will go up to $160 and stay up there.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/13u44c6/hodling_nvda_since_it_was_750_selling_cc_to_get/'
POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:14:49'] Don't be like me. I sold covered calls twice on NVDA. Once on the runup from metaverse. Lost out on doubling my gains from 30k to 60k. Second time I sold one 3 months ago and nvda rallied from my 300 purchase price to 380. I'll sell cover calls on stuff. But that's the last time I sell ccs on NVDA. Sat out on 30-40k of gains for a measly $800 I got from selling the CCs.Edit: Not double the gains. Double the amount in my account from 30 to 60k.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:32:03'] you could sell the NVDA stock to a round lot (down to 100 shares) and use that capital to do what you're looking to do. this would still give you the option of selling CCs as wellsince you're not going to play capital gains tax on the sale, there's no real downside to just selling stock here if you want to diversify more  FWIW, selling 8 shares would cover your entire cost basis for the position PLUS secured profit of around 300% if you've purchased at a $7.50 average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:09:36'] Just sell some to reduce the size down to your desired weight. No need to get unnecessarily fancy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:56:22'] I understand wanting to diversify. Can't blame you with Nvidia's current price either but If you have a longer term view I wouldn't completely liquidate. However, with Amazon I would much rather reduce it to a very small position due to the consistent negative quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:39:51'] If you want to diversify, just sell most of it. It's a tax free account so there are no capital gains taxes to worry about. I wouldn't bother with CCs in your situation. There is a very real chance that NVDA corrects. How would that make you feel?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:04:57'] Selling $30 OTM calls every two weeks would net $480 in premium ($420 strike right now). That seems like a very agreeable price to me even in the event of a run up. You’re free to do whatever you want, including selling now. But that’s a really REALLY nice OTM to premium ratio to me.Weekly would be about $240. This next week is a day short, so premiums closed Friday at $200. Either 1 week or 2 weeks would work
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:19:55'] What about selling some NVDA to buy them? Realize some gains and reduce the chance of losing more if you sell a call and the stock tanks or it takes off and you end up not being along for the ride.You can't just add to the other 2 companies you listed without selling?You want to diversify but you'd be almost completely out of NVDA if the shares get called away.PS: I sold NVDA just before this $100 run :/ and most of what I've been selling calls on has cost me a lot of unrealized gains. Of course all of my stocks I'm not selling CCs on are doing nothing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:30:33'] If you're trying to get rid of the shares I would say just sell them, but if you're committed to a CC strategy you should probably sell an ITM CC rather than OTM

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:31:09'] Thanks for selling a call.  Now it will go up another 20 percent.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:06:58'] You could do what I just did: Sell a Jan 24 500 Call and use the premium to buy a Jan 24 310 Put.Yes, you end up basically even on premium, maybe you cash a couple hundred, but it gives you downside protection and if it gets called at 500 then you should be very happy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:33:59'] $20 out might not pay much....especially a week or 2 out.   It's a decent strategy if you truly want to sell, but if there's a runup, it's painful to watch on the sidelines as your contract becomes worthless and the shares you "kind of own" are worth a thousand more than they were 3 days ago and you can't cash in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:37:33'] Don’t waste your energy on the NVDA CC.  Make your decision to hold it for the price you want or have a stop loss.  At most, I’d do June 16 call 410 if you want to squeeze that $1000 premium right now.  Don’t cloud your judgment on your best trade ever.  Hold it or sell it and don’t regret it.  Context.  I crushed with AAPL in early 2000s. Average cost in <$10 dollar range.   In 2019, sold over 1000 shares for help with down payment on vacation home.  AAPL has gone up a lot since then.  So has that property and never regretted decision.  Currently have 1800 shares from remaining 2000 I had.  My goal was to sell off 500 and diversify.  I’ve done that with 200.  The other 300 are in CC that shot past my CC on this last run from $130 up to 170s.  I don’t think about any of the other moves, but these CC for squeezing that last bit of gain before diversifying has tied me up while I’d rather make other buys with that money on my time frame and clear mind.  Wasn’t worth it.  Maybe for you it’s worth it but not me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 18:24:11'] 3 months ago the price rallied from 300 to 380?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 21:20:57'] Can anyone clarify the tax implications of selling covered calls of the same stock at vastly different price points and what that means for tax loss and gain? It seems when you sell it resets the time which you were holding the 100 shares. At least that's how my stock broker seems to have done it...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:23:17'] A lot of these guys seem to be saying the same thing and I'm going to agree with them.So one or two shares to cover the purchase of a put of your portfolio and roll the put.If you really wanted to do something you could potentially purchase the put, and so current months or week 15% out call.You're just going to have to have alerts set up for the call, this way you collect premium in the same time that premium pays for the hedge of the puts that you're buying that will protect your investment for 180 days.

If there is any new competitor that comes out with something better and challenges either company, they're fucked.MSFT is what I call jack of all trades master of none. They're in home computers, office software, cloud computing & storage, gaming, VR, etc etc. Any of these division could take a massive hit and the company will still churn out profits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 05:51:38'] If you think that sell the call or buy the put. Or maybe you think their services will continue to grow creating more durable revenue regardless of device demand. Or maybe their expectations of demand were just too great and the news of demand not meeting their expectations doesn't mean lower sales at all. Certainly nobody here knows.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 09:33:25'] The last time AAPL moved $5 in 3 days was... last week.  So, it's definitely possible, but that's if you start measuring from the correction on the 19th.In this case, expiration coincides with the Jackson Hole meeting.  JPow is going to be talking at 10AM.  Keep in mind, the market doesn't usually react very well to him no matter _what_ he says.  But there's also a chance he will come out saying "Delta Delta Delta therefore we ain't tapering shit" which could trigger a rally.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 10:39:47'] IDK how well you chart or analyze but you gotta start putting the chart fundamentals into your trading, so for example aapl keeps hitting this ceiling just to drop just to come back to the same ceiling? Sometimes the charts can form things like Ascending Triangle, Descending, or just a triangle where it can break either way. I’ve been using the triangle tactic with BA the past week on the daily and it hits a good amount of the time. Although fundamentals and prices and how much the company is worth and all the other hard facts are super important but so is chart formation, let’s also remember there’s supposed to be a “correction” at some point so maybe aapl makes a descending and when the market corrects it’ll drop 5-10% (but ofc make its way back up) or maybe it’s creating a ascending, either way right now 150 is a resistance level and until it breaks through it’s gonna be seeing some resistance at that level

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 17:00:59'] Purely technical, AAPL is trading at the resistance level of a broad bull channel. Top is 152, looks like next bottom will be 130ish around 9/20. Perfect lottery ticket options for a surprise breakout though. If it did manage to hit 155 it would be a big enough event that it would probably bounce up to 160. If you don’t mind losing $11 it could win you $500. Very low probability, but better than the actual lottery.

It's the only viable options play I can come up with that ends up either being indifferent to IV crush or benefitting slightly from it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 06:14:18'] There is an old expression on the street - buy the reviews and sell the news . Out of the last 45 earnings reports , 39 of them went down the day after they’ve” crushed earnings” . Why? Because they are reporting on the quarter gone by not what lies ahead. It is the governance that dictates the earnings report, unfortunately that is based on the number coming first - first they tell you what happened then they tell you what to expect . My strategy , which has worked very well, has been first to play a short term call  2-3 days ahead along with a cash covered put same equity slightly shorter duration. Equity does a run up ahead of earnings - I close my profitable call, take my cash covered put  premium - profit in both sides . Right before earnings around 3:00 before post market announcement , I take a long put sane equity hold for 2-3 days it drops right into the money I sell. A week later you revisit - most get a bounce up after the information is observed two weeks later . It’s a very good way to play earnings - Snap didn’t go that way for the first time in a long time . Try this strategy ahead of earnings this  week you will do well - it t has a high win rate.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-23 21:38:27'] I think AMD will be up or down 1-2%.AAPL down about 2% and then up in the following days or weeks.GOOGL and FB got crazy run today due to knews about ads selling crazy well. I think either going up even more (snap went up +20%). Or down 2-3% due to sell the news and profit taking.Sbux will go up I think.I rather dont play any option, earnings are very unpredictable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 07:16:05'] 4 options strategies to pursue in the run up to earnings announcements - DOWN - Stock price likely to go down(1) Bear Put Spread - if you are expecting price to go DOWN moderately - buy a put with higher strike, sell a put with lower strike and same expiration.Net Outflow (Premium paid - Premium received)Max Profit = Difference in strike prices - Net OutflowMax Loss = Net OutflowBreak Even = higher strike price - Net outflow&#x200B;(2) Bear Call Spread - if you are expecting price to go DOWN moderately - buy a call with higher strike, sell a call with lower strike and same expiration.Net Inflow (Premium received - Premium paid)Max Profit = Net InflowMax Loss = Difference in strike prices - Net InflowBreak Even = lower strike price + Net inflow&#x200B;UP - Stock price likely to go up(1) Bull Put Spread - if you are expecting price to go UP moderately - buy a put with a lower strike, sell a put with higher strike and same expiration.Net Inflow (Premium received - Premium paid)Max Profit = Net InflowMax Loss = Difference in strike prices - Net InflowBreak Even = higher strike price - Net inflow&#x200B;(2) Bull Call Spread - if you are expecting price to go UP  moderately - buy a call with lower strike, sell a call with a higher strike and same expiration.Net Outflow (Premium paid - Premium received)Max Profit = Difference in strike prices - Net OutflowMax Loss = Net OutflowBreak Even = lower strike price + Net OutflowSome generic pointers (not exhaustive) - (1) Though companies report good earnings, stock prices tend to correct as they have already run up quite a bit. (2) Earnings are in the past but guidance for the future could be weak, which also results in price going down after the earnings call. (3) Revenue might have increased but only at the cost of lower margins due to competition and price discounting. This also results in stock price going down. (4) Revenue and Gross margins might be good enough but SG&A is still high, stock price could correct.(5) Synergies promised during M&A fail to materialize as per the original time line. (6) Business could be cyclical with high PE when there is a trough and low P/E at the peak. Industry specific - (Pharma) - loss of patent protection, pricing power pressure from generics competition, pipeline setbacks, rise in debt due to financing of M&A activity.(Financials) - Lower Net Interest Margins (due to low FED funds rate), Increase in loan provisions for losses due to deteriorating credit metrics, Increase in non-interest operating expenses, Poor loan growth.Good Luck to all!

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 02:03:32'] >I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down.Here Is 1 way to look at how options work.Selling OTM calls or puts is a game of over/under.You think the price will move down then you sell an otm call (cc or spread).  You are playing that the price will stay "under" the strike sold.If you think the price will move up then you sell a put, playing that the price will stay "over" the strike sold.By selling OTM you give yourself a margin of error, where you can be a little wrong about the direction and still win the game.If you are not sure about the direction, but think that the price will make a move, then you can play "outside da box" by selling a butterfly or a Condor (Condor, not an iron condor)Both of these create a lower and upper level of the box, while time (date of entry and expiration) creates the sides.   You are playing that the price will move out of that box before it expires.IMHO European style options work best for the outside da box strategy because they do not have early exercise risk, so this let's you play the index options (NDX, SPX/XSP, RUT/MRUT, and DJX)

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 13:47:07'] You have a lot of extrinsic value for these calls left since you've still got a few months on their expiration. I don't think anybody would advise exercising them before expiration.I think that you have two sensible options if you still want to be long AAPL at this point:1) Sell all of the contracts and use the proceeds to buy shares.2) Roll the contracts and pay a debit to push your expiration out to '23. If you sell 2 of them, you should have more than enough to roll and still come away with some cash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 13:47:04'] I’m always in favor of locking in profits along the way. If you’re still bullish and believe that AAPL’s price will continue increasing before theta starts crushing your options premiums, then you can consider holding a few or all of the contracts. If you need the capital now, sell what you can to acquire it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 17:22:10'] Isn’t this perfect example of pmcc if he sells options weekly except that he’s not that poor?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 15:18:27'] Never exercise a contract before expiration. You are basically throwing money away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 18:56:00'] Technical view.From late August 2020 to July 2021, AAPL, constantly struggled to get past the 137.5/138.5 to 140 (Round number) zone.Also on the weekly, you can see it using the 25 EMA as a support to bounce off. The 25 EMA right now for the weekly is around 139. This is in stark contrast to the daily 25 EMA, where it whipsaws around it.But what's important is that clearly 138 to 140 was THE area to break and at Some point AAPL will come back to retest 140 at least, or if say a month goes by, that 25 weekly EMA could be at 141, but all the orders (long and shorts) are bunched up in the 138 to 140 zone. Now if you look at the Volume profile since Mid May 2021, the most volume is very clearly at the 145.75 level (145 to 146).  This tells me a retest is possible, anywhere from 138 to 146 !! Depending on how it performs there, if sentiment is bullish, and the shorts sell, Apple will bounce back with double pressure of the shorts selling and bulls rejoining.Although there are many options (intended).For you, and based on your replies, I would recomend the following two. Both have been mentioned in various ways.1) You made a 150%, pocket 50%, and do the same thing all over again. If it dips to 145 or whichever of the above levels it has a successful retest at.2) Which I find better.Sell weekly calls, constantly, one cycle after the other. Take advantage of max theta decay. If you see Apple at an obvious resistance level, which sadly right now is nowhere to be found at 154.3, you can even sell ATM calls. But one expiry after the next. If you see your level breached, you can buy the calls back and do it again. Eventually the volatility risk premium is plus ev for you.So for example right now, the Sept 10 th, 155 is @1.29 and the Sept 10 157.5 is @0.53. Choose one of these, that's it, don't even think of the 160 strike. OR even acknowledge the 17th September expiry. We want next expiry, as close to ATM as possible. The 157.5 is fine.  If you sell for 0.53, buy them back at 1 dollar and Do it again. You will lose 47 cents, but make  1.25 on your calls or 1.10 probably. But DO IT AGAIN.If you sell an ATM for 1.29, buy it back for 2.25, your calls will still best the 45 to 50 delta you gave up. Dont worry about assignment or any of that bs, jist manage your trade, put a stop loss everyday. A trigger order not a limit.When it does drop back to the 140:s and starts hitting resistance repeatedly. Execute step 1 above and do the whole thing all over again.Your entire job is to sell as many calls as you can from Sept 10th for the next 90 to 100 days, that should give you 13 14 expirys. And you can pocket anywhere from 5  to 10 dollars. Somewhere around 45 days to expiry, execute step 1, pocket everything above a 100 percent and buy the same calls again that you did when you bought these 120's.And then, guess what, start working every week again. What I am trying to drill continuously is that ATM:s and close to ATM's, a strike off, is where the money is at. Don't sell more then 4 dollars away. Don't be scared of anything. As you can buy insurance for cheap.On the big scale, most of the volume is clustered around 125, but short term that volume spike is at around 145. Those are your guidelines. AND please do not hesitate to insure your self. The 135's only cost 6 cents. These are called units. The 130's are 4 cents. The 120:s are only 2 cents.  These will be also bought every week to get gamma to work for you most efficiently if there is a disaster locally, company wise or systematically.The reason you don't have to worry about gamma yourself is obvious.Everything I have explained is to be kept with ONLY APPLE in mind. Not as a generic strategy. You will do the same thing always in this situation (up 150 percent on a LEAP) but maybe you want be as aggressive as I am telling you to be. It's a series of PMCC's, we know that. But since Apple is at an all time high, I find this route the best in these situations (not that I have had many, I dont buy leaps, but am talking about all time highs).I'm plastered drunk right now. So very sorry. Either this will be logically correct thru and thru or it will be way off. A zero or a 1. Very binary.If what I said makes sense to you. Go for it. Otherwise there are quite a few other  good suggestions. All the best."Picture me being scared of a N***** that breathes the same air as me." RIP to the great one.P.s. those 5 to 10 dollars are what you are gonna earn, regardless of where Apple goes. And buy those units, always.P.s.2. These PMCC's are never more then 4 dollars or 7 days away. This is crucial.P.s. 3. I wish you had stock you had bought at 120.We would have gone nuts with the ratios and straddles etc."I make a million by June, i say fuck July, and if I lose my voice, I'll flow onlineee". Kiss.P.s.4    THE MOST IMPORTANT. This is all structured around your specific situation where you are up 150 percent on your LEAP. I think I said that before.

I guess see what happens in a four months. But I've never known anyone to go broke from taking profits.  Personally I'd say take a little and roll.  given the current conditions and certain criteria leaning toward a correction in spy. Although it's the one stock that doesn't go down. Lol but seriously, corrections are normal up to 5-10% and from. What I've seen the Nas and dow have had a couple corrections this year... but not spy so much...But anyway, take some monies ND roll some options or just keep an eye it and adjust your strategy to market conditions. It may be a different  scenario in a few months.P.S.- don't exercise yet. I've seen others say it and they're right. There is intrinsic left in the table. But just watch the market.  There's a reason for leaps. No rush and no pressure. 😃

You may just want to sell the options you have and buy further out options.  You can do it as one trade which is the rollout another posted about or two trades.   You many want to calculate how much Apple stock has risen in the period of time you have held the options and see what has performed better.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 18:17:34'] Apple earnings is approaching. It will likely trend up leading into earnings. Take a chill pill…. Even AAPL doesn’t go up all the time
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:49:18'] You can say it's IV or just say it's demand, but option prices don't move precisely in line with the stock, not even LEAPS.Looking at the last six months, AAPL's price is up 7.45%. In that time it ranged from -7.69% down ($122.25 low on May 12) to +17.82% up ($157.26 high on Sep 7).In the same time, over the last six months, AAPL Jun 17 '22 130.00 Call's price is up 5%, having ranged from as low as -43.4% down ($11.30 low on June 3) to +62.65% up ($32.79 high on Sep 7).I suspect you bought it right around that peak, probably between Aug 30 and Sep 9. Nothing to beat yourself up about, everybody who trades has, at some point, bought something right at the m'fing tippy-top.But you're okay. What to do about it now depends upon your views about AAPL, which I assume haven't changed, and about future IV, which I suspect you might not have considered much.I don't know your overall plan for it, but you've got time, it's in the money, and there's good odds that AAPL goes up as does its IV at some point before June 2022, perhaps quite soon given earnings.The real question is: what's your objective here? If, for example, you're looking to grab a 20% profit from current price, you can probably just dumbly set a good-to-close order at $24.00 and forget about it (well, obviously, follow the market to see if AAPL is crashing and burning, etc). It probably trips that line within the next month or two.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 18:32:03'] You have plenty of time. How much exposure you have if not much then avg down. We should see earnings run up. I'm stuck with Jan 135 calls as well... Will make a call next week to exit or hold on based on how market moves next week
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 19:43:35'] So many people recommending to keep holding.. but deep down you know.That you may be seeing 50% down 🤡
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 19:36:17'] 8 months is a good amount of time for apple to go up, how much are you down, %wise on your calls?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 19:07:50'] Have you been selling calls on it to lower your cost basis?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:22:08'] nah, man. with earnings coming you're probably good. you're only down 20% with lots of time. even if earnings turn out to be a miss, there's often a runup going into them. plus you can always manage your premium by getting in and out of the same position, keeping profit —but that's more active than necessary if you're inexperienced
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:29:01'] With logistic and supply issues do we really expect apple to have great earnings  and run as it always does towards earnings?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:42:05'] IMO AAPL will reach 132ish in the near future because it touched the top it’s channel and tried to break out. The last 3 times it did that, AAPL fell to the bottom of the channel which is currently at 132ish. It might of course also run up to earnings and even if it falls to 132 - could still break back up to 155 after :) and my whole theory could be completely wrong… but if you are concerned about the current loss, know that IMO it could get way more extreme in the very near future
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 22:53:46'] I got june 2023 AAPL $140 call leaps for $23 each, 55 delta. In hindsight, i think 70 delta are a little better (for my retirement account) as the 55 delta don't move enough and I feel I'm lacking enough exposure to apple long. Apple has gone sideways a full year now and continues to be incredibly profitable. I'd say hold one all the way to expiration and try to buy the dips and sell high points on the 2nd half. That way if apple has another sideways year you can pull some profit out still. Covered calls not really worthwhile imo on apple cuz the call premiums are a bit on the cheap side currently, but I occasionally sell a call or two when price gets stupid high.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 02:31:38'] buy more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 04:15:47'] This can definitely be due to IV and interest rates. Specifically Vega and Rho. People who buy leaps need to pay attention. Last few years, leaps worked super well because rates were falling.This may not be the case this time. For every move in the interest rate up, the value of your option decreases.  That’s because, that same contract is worth more today then it will be tomorrow. What’s the best outcome ?! Buy deep ITM leaps ! This reduces theta and maximizes delta. When they bring in profits roll every two to three months. Collect your profit !
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 18:10:46'] From my limited understanding, numerous factors (like Apple's stock price going down) caused the option to decrease and the delta to decrease. In my opinion you've got plenty of time till expiration plus I think Apple will close EOY above $155 so your call will be fine as long as you hold. I wouldn't think about exiting until at least Jan
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 21:09:26'] Consider next time buying a LEAP with longer-dates expiration, ie the 2023 or 2024 ones. That might help with your stress. Personally I would sell some calls against your leap and that could help narrow the 20% loss fairly quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 23:04:31'] You’re at hopefully close to the bottom of a correction. It will rebound when the broader market recovers into earnings and December
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 23:44:04'] LEAPS are the only options that are okay with bleeding you'll be fine
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 00:58:00'] I'd sell it and leap out another year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:54:46'] I mean, you’ve got so much time on your option. I view my leaps as long term investments and I just diamond hand them to oblivion. If it’s a good, bullish underlying, a leaps call will deliver returns eventually
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:07:42'] You got 9 months plenty of time it likely go green- If you have already bought full size (1%) risk of account then no but if you haven't bought full size you can buy more. You are really betting on will the market be up or down in the next 9 months. So if you think the market will go up (I do) then you can get a full size position or wait for a bounce off gap close. Just don't risk to much and hold to target or cut if market really tanks and take your loss
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:08:05'] tbh i am slightly bearish on aapl rn and i have puts but maybe thats just me. You still have a lot of time I would recommend wait and see approach.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:11:07'] Hold and sell an OTM naked .20 delta to your cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 21:03:29'] Dont jump out of a LEAP position more than 8 months from expiration unless something significant has changed your original investment thesis. LEAPs can be tough. Time is on your side. Dont panic and sell when you have plenty of time left just because the stock sold off a bit. Apple should benefit from a strong holiday time (if their supply chain holds up).
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 21:54:24'] Define & understand your financial & emotional risk in this given position. Once it is below your stop, cut the trade & don’t get caught up on it. Otherwise, they’re leaps for a reason, & you have plenty of time for the stock to be ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 22:39:24'] Sometimes stocks go down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 22:59:45'] Don’t quote me but i think that this September was the second worst month for the market since Covid. Hold off and be patient on a likely recovery. You have time. Always zoom out to a long term chart and you’ll see that there’s likely no real reason that the trend would stop pretty abruptly without major market news.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 23:12:29'] we’re rolling into earnings season
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 23:12:42'] you have plenty of time. But let it be known that from your wording, you seem to have a heavy position here. Never bet the farm, diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 23:40:02'] Just hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 01:19:43'] Christmas is around the corner and guess what is gonna be on every teenager's wish list?  That's right, an apple product.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 04:43:22'] Tons of time. Relax. I hold 10 Jan2023 100 calls. They are down obviously. Not stressing.  If there is a company to be down in and feel safe at the same time, it’s Apple. Don’t forget earnings are on the horizon. Like most of the time, we will probably start seeing a run up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 05:09:39'] You’re getting drained by theta since the option is pretty much trading sideways. You can sell covered calls with a month expiry that are worth more than your strike to hedge against your position. But I would wait until earnings before doing this in case it pops. Then after it pops sell covered calls against it with a one month expiry that have a 30 delta or lower.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 05:53:05'] You could try to roll down and/or out before adding additional calls. Both ideas will increase your principal at risk. Adding calls gives you more upside. Rolling gives you more probability of a profitable trade by lowering your break even and/or giving you more time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 06:56:50'] 1. You have plenty of time. Your call is still ITM and AAPL will probably have a bull run nov->jan (like every single year ever except 2018) and it'll hit $145-$155 and you'll profit.2. Options were created to get the *sellers* of the options money, not the buyers. So, your game plan should always revolve around taking advantage of that, not falling prey to it. This is why we sell calls at a shorter expiration and a higher strike while the LEAPS is sitting in your account, to lower the cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 07:32:48'] Hold and sell covered calls against it with strikes at your break even price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 08:16:26'] Buy more to average down. I’m betting on  AAPL announcing a new buyback program after earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 08:28:13'] Just a tip for next time1. When you buy a leap I personally prefer 12 months out. Also you can sell covered calls using your leap as collateral (poor man covered call). Meaning you have the same leverage with 100 shares as you do with a leap Also you have 6 months left. I would personally hold until 2 months and see how the option is doong
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 08:37:49'] Be careful not to look at after hours options pricing as they may be at the bid price, not mid/last/ask.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 09:35:21'] I always do spread on Leaps. This way overall gains/loss don’t impacted by current move. But it will as theta decays. Buy vertical calls deep in money to get decent returns.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 09:58:43'] When did you buy them?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 10:44:28'] I usually decide my profit and when it is up 20-30% I book my profit in leaps and again buy back when it goes it's a wheel strategy what I follow. So technically if I don't 5 trades like this I would have 40-50% which is fine and reasonable.Just my way for trading leaps.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 10:53:08'] What's your thesis now? If you think it'll go up then just hold, maybe sell near term OTM calls.If you think it'll stay sideways for a while then sell near term ATM or barely OTM calls. Or just take your  loss if you see better opportunities for your money.If you think it'll go do down then ya exit the position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 10:58:25'] The advantage of Leaps is time - time is in your side here , do nothing , we have earnings , Christmas , 5G, - it will go up- things took a big hit and it’s not over . More corrections , more uncertainty- supply  chain , bank earnings , fed and tapering - all this affects stock prices . Apple at 138 in my mind was the low - at 142 a counter maneuver to recoup losses might be to consider a cash covered put up the road say after earnings . The stock hopefully moves up and you keep the premium - a 2.00 per share option premium x 100 shares is 200 per option . If you sold puts at 130 odds are it won’t go  bet there in the next three weeks . 13000 gets you a nice premium back and a hedge against your losses to date on the leap . Something to consider Sit tight time decay is on your side
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 11:04:19'] I'm so confused. Did you just not consider the possibility that Apple could go down when you bought them? Did you think LEAPS were some form of arbitrage that only go up? Lmao...
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 11:13:12'] Sell closer expiration calls against it for a poor mans covered call
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 11:17:18'] Buy LEAPS further out...then you have more time for the price to move your way.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 14:02:12'] IMHO, never exit leaps unless fundamentals change or you hit your profit goal (presumably this happens before theta decay really kicks in). One cool thing to do with leaps or any bought options really is see if you can sell an option against it for how much you paid for the leap. That way you 100% secure profit, but a stock needs to make big moves with big IV for this to happen. Still something to watch out for.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 15:35:00'] June 2022 expiration? Yeah i promise you if I was in your position i would not be worried in the least bit. I hope you are selling calls against your position this whole time you should be winning on all of them
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 17:00:26'] If there’s one thing I’ve learned about options it’s that you can lose your shirt very quickly
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 16:33:05'] sell everything and just DCA in VOO if you're worried about aapl leaps. no but seriously stocks actually can go down, just keep selling CC's and roll them down if we continue to go down
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 22:25:17'] Buy 90 delta 2 years out instead if you can afford them.  Or better yet buy Microsoft at the max expiration given at 90 delta and roll every 6 to 9 months.  Microsoft runs more strady yet still generates a higher return than spy.  This will help keep the big black dog of off your ass.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 20:04:19'] June 2022 isn't a leap
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-09 21:46:01'] What's your stop loss? What is your exit strategy? If you didn't have either of those in mind before you entered the trade, you already lost the trade. If the thesis behind your initial purchase still holds true, keep on keepin' on and stop checking the numbers daily. If something has changed, certainly re-assess and decide if you want to cut losses, maybe wait for earnings IV rise, or hold on.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 08:03:53'] For those with AAPL leap positions that have gone against them - know that the cavalry is coming. Don’t sell, especially if your horizon is long. Close the app (or uninstall) and just enjoy your day. You will profit. Promise

POST_TEXT: b'Investors in Apple Inc. AAPL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 2, 2022 $70.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\n\nGiven the way analysts feel about Apple right now, this huge implied volatility could mean theres a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 1.4% to close at $161.38. Apple has long been rumored to be working on its Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality headset.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 12:55:53'] Probably an unpopular opinion here but I would let it run. Your strike price is probably around $150/share +/- a few bucks and there is a huge difference in returns from only a $10 difference in share price.You bought calls with expirations a long ways out, I would let it ride at least into the second half of 2022. As supply chain normalizes, Apple wins. Please note: I have dozens of AAPL LEAPS currently and have seen returns of over 400% time and time again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-08 15:27:41'] If your strikes are still out of money — sell your calls. You bought those as speculative trade. It worked in your favor and now cash in when IV is above 40% for aapl. This applies if your strikes are at the money right now. You have to cash in as much extrinsic value as possible. If your strikes are in the money and deep in the money, means you are truly bought LEAP. Dont sell such contracts with so many days to expiry. Ride the waves and keep feeling good for another year looking at your profit. You sell such deep in the money contracts few months before expiry, not before that. You bought 400 apple shares at almost 14k. Enjoy that 75% off deal.

Watched it wash away to -20%. Yes i had set a stop loss just think it was for a day not GTF.  Came back to 30% and sold it out of fear.  It just seemed like apple stalled.  Bad earnings results, evergrande etc.  Now if i kept them they would be over 155%.  Of course i regret it, but i learned from that. You have 57% profit. Set the stop loss at something you like, 50% profit maybe?  Set it to “good till filled” and move on. Any sharp drops will trigger it and you still walk with profits.

Today was a down day which is a warning on sentiment plus market chatter says apple may be over bought. Regardless how well the company does it’s always a struggle to get the markets respect. Add to that the major players front running our trades and taking the opposite side of the trade. I took the daily loss against my larger winnings and will keep an eye on a possible re-entry. It’s a tricky dance with deeper pockets that have more info about me than I about them.

Not exactly the setup you were asking for but the high level approach may be similar enough.Your decisions about how to close your trade should have already been considered when you entered the position.  I don't specifically target getting into a position around earnings so it's not an input I have to deal with regularly.  However, consider that AAPL will typically manifest a move speculating on its performance soon after the reveal of the earnings call date.  Relative to that, the moves on and after the earnings call will be lack luster.  This is just something I have noticed with AAPL from my time wheeling it in the last two years.If you have the conviction to sell, sell it soon before the price mean reverts from the inflated RSI level as of this morning.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 06:53:52'] AAPL defied the inflation news and is now surging again above 146.  Great news, and now we shall see what it does before earnings. Be advised that just because AAPL sank after last quarter's stellar blow-out earnings, historically there is a 50-50 chance it will go up or down after excellent earnings reports. It might even remain flat after earnings and make it a non-event. So just decide if you are a long, medium or short term holder (I recommend longterm because it should get over $200) and remember that any sharp sell-off is a buying opportunity.  I myself have 50,000 shares i am not touching and 5,000 extra swing trade shares I might sell above 155, but even if I do that I might try to buy them back if there is another big sell-off. But just standing pat might be my best decision. Historically it usually is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 05:42:16'] 100% depends on what the stock does until then. If it goes no further, stalling around $144, then hold through earnings.  Earnings are likely to surprise to the upside and so that ought to be enough to spike us into the 150's.  However if this happens prior to earning then trimming whatever you don't want to hold longterm is an option. Not that 150's is the top, but I always trim a little of any stock after  big run just to be on the safe side. However we are not there yet. 144 is still a bit undervalued IMHO. Short term I see AAPL deserving 155, medium term 180 and longterm over 200.  Besides, what better place is there to put your money?  And what other stock provides the value whether we get past covid or get stuck in a rightwing-caused 4th wave due to anti vaxxer disinformtion?

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 11:28:14'] You can roll it to the January 2024 $115 or $120 strike for about the same price. Or if you think the stock has more downside, you can sell now and wait to buy the January 2024 $110 at the same price you sold the January 2023 for. I’ve done the second option a few times before and it’s always worked out. It only has to drop probably around 5 points or so to get a new option at the same price another year out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 14:09:04'] LEAPS are just like any other option, you close out at your profit goal. This is especially true in a Roth where you don't have to worry about short term gains. So what's your goal? 50%? 75%? Then wait for another good entry point and buy another, or move onto another underlying.

Choose an out of the money strike that gives you some breathing room. If it gaps up and goes in the money, roll a week or more to get more premium. At some point, you let the “shares” get called away or you sell a call expiring 01/20/2023.

If you are buying options, you are probably a trader.  if you consider yourself a long term investor, you should probably just buy the stock and hold it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:13:26'] This is a good example of how simplifying a problem to make it easier to explain can lead to an incorrect conclusion, because important facts were left out in the simplification process.**TL;DR** - The assumption of a two-person market where only one contract is traded is the flaw in the logic. Time value arises when you compare **two trades in time that are otherwise equal**. Since there is only one trade in this example, of course there is no time value. Contriving an example that eliminates time value does not prove that time value doesn't exist.It's easy to reveal this flaw by introducing a second identical trade whose only difference is that it happens at a later time. Same contract specs -- underlying, strike price, expiration, put type, etc.So now then, given that their are two identical contracts in the market, which one should the new (second) buyer buy, the old existing one or the new one? Is there a difference between them? They have identical terms, so why should there be a difference in value? Should it matter that the original buyer bought it for $4? Does that have any bearing on what it is worth now? No, the previous value of the first contract makes no difference to the new buyer. What matters is what the contract is worth now.Let's assume that the contracts should have equal value. It's provable why they should and why an arbitrage would arise if they didn't have equal value, but for the sake of brevity, let's just take this claim on faith.To make this super obvious, let's assume the second contract will be traded 1 second before expiration and AAPL's price is the exact same $180.09 it was when the original put was first traded. How likely is it for a buyer to pay a full $4 of premium for a $180 put 1 second before expiration when the contract would be $.09 OTM? Zero chance, right? That put should be next to worthless now.**So if the second contract is no longer worth $4, what happened to the value of the first contract?** Applying our assumption on faith, they should have equal value. Therefore, the $4 value of the original put has been lost. One might even say that $4 of value has decayed away, and since the only difference between the two trades is time, calling that decay "time decay" and the value lost "time value" seems to make sense, don't you think?With two points in time established, it should be intuitive why intermediate points in time would have intermediate amounts of theta decay.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 20:00:52'] I read some, but honestly not all of that.The reason we know that there is a time value is that in every instance, options on the same underlying with the same strikes but different expirations will have different premiums with the longer dated expiration being higher.(If you ever find an exception to that rule, tell me and we’ll make billions risk free.)

And the stock never moves cause they're the only participants?Having the derivative in the first place makes no sense in this example
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:47:19'] The thing is in this example(and yes I read the entire thing) is that both participants know everything there is to know about this particular product, present and future. This is a hypothetical efficient market and therefore your thought experiment is true. There's no risk or premia for riskUnfortunately, that's why it doesn't apply to the real world.  There's tangible risk in the real world and options are a way to move risk at premia to someone else that wants the risk. Risk is definable and quantifiably increased with more time for more things to possibly happen before the options expires. And technically theta is a function of expected volatility of the product over time.So you are correct in your example but incorrect in application for real world uses

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:54:09'] You're ignoring so many factors and I can't decide if it's on purpose or what.I've entertained the "time does not exist" argument from a physics and philosophical point of view, but even considering time as a human construct, there's the tacit understanding that measurable seconds are passing by as we discuss it.Here we have something much more concrete--options are not relative, they are derivative. Time value can easily be seen if you wish to understand it. If your can of baked beans was an "insurance" metaphor, well, the terms expire and you have to pay more premiums. Seems they expire due to a time component. The expiration defines the time component limit of the contract. Options are not actually stores of value in large part due to their time component.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 18:07:15'] Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can’t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.So I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. Next day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.From my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.I consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 16:29:52'] You should be fine. However, I typically sell CCs against my LEAPS. First handful of cycles right at (or a couple strikes above) my break even. Really softens the blow on down days. Even better, is seeing both legs in the green as your short leg nears expiration. 👌

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 19:21:26'] If you are not selling weeklies then theta is against you. AAPL is overvalued but since price target is 200 then you might make it. Take a deep breath and HODL!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 15:57:57'] So breakeven being 161.85 and if market ends up correcting and going sideways, I would say hold off probably into Mid-October and see if u can get back to ur original price or the loss u r comfortable with nd get out. Even being AAPL, I wont be comfortable with that breakeven and given where market sits right now with the headwinds ahead of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 17:09:38'] I would usually advise to sell at a loss to recoup remaining premium.But I’ll make an exception for AAPL LEAPS.  That one you can HODL and have a reasonable chance of making out okay.

That's the risk we take.  I'd sell monthly 165 calls against it in the meantime to recoup some capital and plan to sell the March call by February.  But that's just what I would do with my money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 02:38:41'] I wouldn’t hold past the middle of October. We should rally hard by the end of this month but sometime into October could get bad, like for most if the market in general. I mentioned weeks ago on this sub we were due for a 5 to 10% pull back soon, I just didn’t know when for sure, we almost reached 5% in the latest drop. Unless theres a drop again, should rally quite well. Next drop will be really bad though if thats the case.You’re basically taking a gamble with a timetable. If the drop comes sooner, it may still recover enough after but a 10% drop could trigger some really nasty further selling. Look at the options expirations with most OI through the next month, try using an online max pain calculator, take that number with a grain of salt though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 05:17:18'] Wait for holiday numbers and they will go up once again
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 05:25:32'] I'd sell calls against it. I opened a diagonal spread on Apple as well recently (sounds like around the same day actually):* Long: Sept 16 2022 $115 (@ $40.55)* Short: Oct 29 2021 $150 (@ $6.40)My plan is to wait until the November weeklies come out and start pushing the short leg out. Selling ATM options should net me at least $100/week. My long leg closed yesterday being down $870 (10.73%) but my short leg is up $660 (51.56%). The premiums on the short legs definitely help soften the blow overall and can generate weekly income. Of course, if it runs through your strike you'll miss out on some profit, but that's the trade-off.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 08:03:29'] Average down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 09:04:07'] You should have bought another one when it dropped. Stocks move up and down, buy low sell high.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 09:26:28'] If the fundamentals have not changed, buy more. You cannot be emotional when investing. You could do a poor mans covered call to lower your cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 10:43:24'] Your break even is 161.85 so quite far. The delta on those LEAPS was quite small.I was also down most of the year on AAPL LEAPS with a strike of 125 so when it mooned to almost 160 I did lock the profits.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 13:49:43'] how is this even a LEAP? if its expiring in six months ?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-23 20:08:23'] I expect it to have a run into the next earnings. Depending on your thesis, you might want to sell right before earnings, or sell a higher call while the vol is high.There are a lot of people still calling for a correction. A correction will come at some point, but timing it is a problem. The market could go up another 10-15% before the next 10% correction.

POST_TEXT: b"I've been playing around with small cash on options, to learn the game. Have lost some, made some small gains, nothing special.\n\nI'm now in a position I need advice on if I would be best in selling my call option, or waiting still more. I specifically own a few 140 call options for July 16 on AAPL. I'm up 150% on them but my gut tells me I would be best to wait till end of next week as I'm expecting the stock price to still continue to rise. I'm aware of time decay but can't really tell if it's too risky to leave it till end of next week.\n\nThoughts?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 08:52:02'] 1. Time decay only applies to extrinsic value, but right now, you are OTM so extrinsic value is all you have, so...If you expect it to go ITM next week by more than the 1.36 it is currently trading at, then you necessarily gain more than you would lose to decay. But that's only if that happens.2. Any time I have multiple options in a position and I am up more than 100%, I decide to take at least half off the table to make sure I pocket some profit.After that, if it goes straight up, then I make good money on the remaining options and I get over the fact that "I could have made more if I hadn't sold those other ones!"If it goes down, then the worst case scenario is that I made a small win. But a win is a win!Depending on your risk tolerance, you could hold it all and take the chance that it won't turn back into a loser.But what if there is general bad economic news next week and the general market starts to plummet? Or what if news comes out that there is an even bigger microchip problem than we thought? Or Apple has a big problem with their suppliers?With a date of July 16, you don't have much time left so any news can make it turn around and it won't have much time to recover so the risk gets greater.The way I see it, taking a small win (and 150% is hardly a small win) and missing out on a bigger win is always better than taking nothing and risking it turning against you because you waited too long.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 10:15:41'] Enter with a plan, exit with a plan.  150% is a sweet profit.  Sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 09:25:50'] 150% today is better than 75% next week.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 14:10:16'] If you can, set a trailing stop-loss order. Example: you bought at $1.00, now it's up to $2.50.  Set up a stop loss order to trail by, say, $0.50 below current price, so $2.00. This way you don't lose your gains, but if the underlying keeps going up your stop price keeps ratcheting up as well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 15:32:48'] My advice is for yr nxt trade and all future trades, you need to decide an exit before you even enter, this is fundamental to any trading plan. Entry, position size , duration , risk , exit.only 3 things can happen...it goes up, down or sideways....you decide what u will do in all of these eventualities before even entering a trade.  U shouldn't wait for one of these to occur before addressing it.leaving money on the table and it turning in to a loss will leave u kicking yrself .What would you have done if the trade had gone the other way ?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 08:46:34'] You are up 150%?!!? Sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 18:35:25'] Another option is to roll the option. If you think it's going up, take profits and buy another contract at a higher strike further out.Why?1) Your itm option is already so deep that your Gamma won't be as high. That your contracts value won't go up as fast as it did before. So if you think it's going up then why not bump the strike? That way you capture more gainz.2) roll the expiration date further. This gives you a buffer room in case you're wrong. Yes you pay a premium for the extrinsic value but it's often worth it so you can exit your position with some extrinsic value remaining instead of bagholding a worthless contract.3) forces you to take profit. Seriously. 4) if you suddenly doubt your play after rolling (ie. Your expiration is after earnings and Apple suddenly tanks at earnings), you can convert your position into a pmcc if your strike is still ITM.4a) if you want to also be optimal you can pmcc the earnings. The premiums will be really high bc of IV crush. So it's actually very optimal to be selling options during that time.Again, for these 4 reasons, rolling your option is probably the best since it gives you more options to play with instead of taking profits and being in a potentially unprofitable position.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 22:05:44'] Great post, because I, like others have come here through the lure of profits and LEARNED about the reasonable profits and strategies. I hope I can get a quick follow-up answer .If my plan is to Buy calls and sell them before EXP... Is a P/L graph useless compared to the option calculator giving you an estimate in this case? Or are both these tools not for me, and only for those that are planning to exercise?I tested the waters on 1c 7/16  on FORD for $16... I thought it might rise near earnings, but also wanted to just try this out. paid 28.00... I did get to see the options market actually work: went down to 15.00, but then actually went up today, when F cracked $15. I didn't;t think it was going to make the strike, so I sold for loss. Fine with that. But in this case, with 1 contract at 28.00, I'm still thinking of the $$ profit form the P/L... And I think that that is wrong, now.My question with a better frame is this: If I take the strategies I learned here... ITM, at 30-45 days (small capital)... and I have an exit plan... I guess making dollar estimates of profit is NOT the way to think... I should be just making the play I can, with an exit based on percentage profit?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 20:40:48'] i would sell a 145 or 150 call above for each with the same expiry maybe. this locks in profiti would also maybe sell 30-50 percent of the  calls and cash in.. that way what’s left can run till the end without a major hit.that said it’s always a gamble of some sort and it’s a matter of do you feel lucky today.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 20:36:23'] I used to… sometimes still do play apple swing plays, when your at profits, take it while you can, it’ll nosedive and you can buy back into that play again or make a new play based off the same thesis.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 18:59:04'] I would at least churn them, so sell the ones you have and if you would still buy it today, buy August options. What you don't want is AAPL to pull back a little and it really hits you hard because there's no time left. I never hold within 2 weeks of expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 18:51:11'] I remember one analyst giving his prediction on Apple and he said it will go to $140 by end of July, I wish I bought calls last month but definitely glad I didn’t get the puts I was considering since the reactions to his prediction were not good
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 18:29:28'] Sell.You've made 150%Sell.You've got two weeks to expiration, and theta decay is going to accelerate.  If AAPL doesn't break through 140 quickly, you're gonna lose money.I close positions on 35% gains *hell or high water* and I've made a fortune doing so.It's by the grace of the options gods that you've made as much as you have.You'll find that the same attitude that sees your positions reaching +100% or more is the same attitude that sees you turning triple digit gains into 80% losses. Sell.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 15:37:12'] I'd just hold.  It seem AAPL is on its leg up to another ATH.Another option is to roll it up to a slightly higher strike so you take some profit (credit).  It'll lower your downside risk, but it will also lower your delta so you make less per dollar rise in AAPL, and you will also get a quicker time decay because it'll be more OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-02 13:07:10'] Definitely continue following the technicals and fundamentals, but you could also cash out any potential realistic losses you might incur so that you're even in a worst case scenario. You could go a little bit beyond that to take in let's say 15% profit, and let the rest of the shares ride.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 06:16:51'] I bought 100 calls 0917 $165 on 7/2, selling roughly 10 by 10 as stock price rises every $5. Now I have 37 calls left and plan on selling all but 10 calls to bet there will be FOMO if earning is good. This is my most successful trade in this year. Another on is AMD call but not as much as AAPL.All I read is that betting against earning is so risky.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 06:07:46'] The past month of gains Apple has seen is uncommon for a stock with an over 2 trillion dollar market cap. IV is going to sharply drop post earnings, this will crush the value of your calls. If you don't want to take full profits, I would lock in a minimum of 80% of the gains and let the rest ride (potentially into the ground or moon).The answer to your question can't be fully made without knowing your call's expiration date and strike price.

You called it a "bear" put spread, so I assume (but want to make sure) that you believe that AAPL will go down.So AAPL closed Friday just below $175.This is the weekend, so option prices are going to change Monday when the market opens, but as of the close of market Friday, you could have done this:* Sell a $175 AAPL put with an expiration of 4/1/2022 for $2.30/share, or $230* Buy a $177.50 AAPL put with an expiration of 4/1/222 for $3.85/share, or $385Most brokerages charge roughly a $0.50/option commission, so add a dollar to your cost and you would have spent $156.Suppose that come Friday afternoon, AAPL is trading at $165/share (or any number safely below $175 where there is no worry about a sudden spike).  You will simply do nothing.  Your $177.50 option will be exercised for you.  You will sell 100 shares of AAPL and receive $17,750  Your $175 option will be assigned. You will buy 100 shares of AAPL, at a cost of $17,500.The difference between these two numbers if $250.  Subtract the $156 you spent and you will have profited $94.On the flip side, suppose, come Friday afternoon, AAPL is trading safely above $177.50, say, $190.  Both options are simply going to expire as worthless and you will have lost the $156 that you spent on the options to begin with.If AAPL is anywhere near the $175-177.50 range, then you will want to close out the options yourself (which will cut into your theoretical profit because there will be a time premium).  The WORST thing that can happen is that ONLY ONE of the options gets exercised/assigned, then there is some big news over the weekend that moves against you, and you find yourself in a big hole.  Suppose that you're looking at AAPL, you see it is $174, and you figure, great - maximum profit!  But then, a few seconds after close, it shoots up to $175.01.  Now, the $175 put you sold will expire as worthless.  But your $177.50 put will be exercised for you.  You will find yourself short 100 shares of AAPL with an extra $17,750 in cash.  Now suppose over the weekend, there's some great economic news and AAPL shoots up to $190.  Now, instead of your "maximum loss" of $156, you're going to lose a whole lot more because you're short shares that are worth $19,000.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 15:29:44'] If you’re new to this, you’re starting correctly. That July expiry gives you an insane amount of time to ensure this position ends profitably.No guarantees (ever), but I like this. If the long/shorts need to sell more longs tomorrow to cover meme stock shorts, AAPL *could* still see some downside, but... who cares? You were smart/cautious and bought July expirys.And you may well have found something near a bottom—a feat in itself.I like the play.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 14:33:12'] Avg down at 115 or 112 and hopefully it doesn’t see 109 again. I’ve seen it recently go from 130-109 so nothing says it couldn’t happen again

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 16:59:13'] You also need a plan: what happens if the price does not increase and your options starts to lose the value due to time? Are you going to, for example, sell it in April and buy a new one dated at September? Are you going to ride it out until expiration? Are you going to sell it at a loss?

I’m guessing that’s per contract above otherwise that’s a steep increase to profitability over the premium. Been watching videos like crazy (thanks to the great playset here on this subreddit!) and now wondering if there’s a standard when reading posts?  Thank you!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-26 22:37:43'] I was literally thinking about buying some call options on Apple since (I feel as if) it's bound to rebound eventually
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-27 08:10:21'] You executed it well buying ATM with plenty of time but I don't like the choice of stock. AAPL is considered a growth stock. The hedge funds are currently rotating out of growth into value. I expect AAPL to be closer to 115 in the next 2 months. Buying the dip randomly in a downtrend  does not have a strong chance of success.

Is there a benefit for the purchase of shares to be at a far lower price when the options are exercised? Does this have to do lowering the risk of being completely invested in a stock ie $75 for $100 DIS calls, paying $7500 for the option rather than being fully invested $17000. If DIS falls you don’t have to exercise and lose less money than you would otherwise.Reply if I need to clarify more.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 08:07:20'] This is a fairly risky bet made on what seems to be an incorrect premise.AAPL is not plunging because of an antitrust suit - it is plunging because tech stocks in general are plunging across the board today.If over the next week AAPL declines to, say 113, which it can easily do, then your loss will be $10 per share on a bet where the max gain was 83 cents. And this on a stock that has been cycling sideways with high volatility since September.Assuming this is cash-secured, you are also locking up $13K per contract for 10 days.To make this bet I think that a Put Credit Spread at the same expiry would have made much more sense (although I wouldn't do that either given AAPL's recent behavior). [Edit: corrections]
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 08:21:19'] Successful investing over the long haul requires all the arrows to be pointing your direction - too many pointing against you in the AAPL trade.  The big one right now is the market posture.  You may be happy owning AAPL at $123 when it is at $132, but is a different matter, when it is at $90.

My only real regret is that I probably won’t get assigned early for the dividend. AAPL dropped for a while a few weeks back and then recovered just fine. I still think it’s a great long term pick.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 13:59:22'] Bought OTM LEAPs in March that are now deep ITM and have been buying more on any dip below $110 or so. The harder it falls the heavier I will buy. As long as I give myself a 2 year window odds are good that I will be able to turn a profit.Works until it doesn’t 🤷‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:22:47'] Adding to 2022 Jan LEAP calls every time we dip below $110
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 09:19:57'] I was selling covered calls on shares I got after the split. Talk about pain... From a seller perspective now is a great time to buy. Volatility is crazy low so it's not even worth the risk of selling calls. I'm more happy to hold shares and wait for the giant to wake up again. I think 3/21 is a great timeframe as well. Apple will clean up q4 sales
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 10:08:14'] Thanks for positing this. I bought a cheap weekly once I realized how far down it had dropped.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 11:29:23'] The M1 chips is huge. Maybe AAPL is now worth \~2trillion that everything can be said priced in for big tech companies, but I doubt the huge sales in M1 Macs and iPhone 12 are priced in for next ER.. especially at this price.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 12:08:00'] I quit my position last week. Its almost been a month AAPL has been moving sideways and was killing my call options, decided to take 10% loss and close the position.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 12:51:54'] How can y’all be in positions that long?? Damn, I’m not knocking your plan but omg.. 3/21?
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 15:11:22'] I've been holding the AAPL 3/19/21 125c and selling short term calls against it

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 02:46:23'] Bought my first leap ever.107June22.  Let's see how it pans out
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 10:32:51'] I think there are other prospects with much better potential. I would just go for shares with apple right now. The last 3 months have been disappointing. Were also months away from any new apple events.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 12:02:39'] Economic context is important. This year is different than any year on record, so don't expect the same holiday trends.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 13:12:31'] - Closed below the 50-day MA despite that acting as resistance in October and acting as support earlier this month.- The candle today is massively red.- It's already outpaced the market (up 55% despite it's recent downtrend).Conclusion:  I just don't see any reason to enter right now using options because this can trade sideways and eat up the calls.  Maybe shares but I think I can get it closer to $108/109.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 13:21:56'] I picked up 115 strike calls for next week near the close today, expecting to be able to close tmmrw easily.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 16:56:13'] I bought a single LEAPS expiring in March. Should I sell calls on it to make back premium or let it be
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:10:18'] My guess is as good as anyone else’s in terms of where AAPL or anything else will be in the near or far future, but as far as reasoning to enter the trade is concerned, I find yours to be very reasonable and promising. It’s actually kind of refreshing to see a reasonably thought out trade on this sub as opposed to the usual “I bought 11/27 AAPL $500 calls and AAPL moved up by $1 today but how come my calls went down.”Personally, I would sell before the next ER though. And also ideally I try not to hold long options past 60 DTE as theta really starts to accelerate at that point, 45 DTE would be the absolute limit for me to hold a long option position if I had to push it, though again ideally I would have exited well before that point. Another thing I personally try to do is that I buy right at or slightly itm. This starts producing immediate delta/gamma returns if the stock starts moving in your direction at all and the option continues to become deeper itm, and then if we run into increasing IV and all that good stuff, it makes for a good environment to exit those positions (such as before an ER). But your strike price is not so far from the money and I do feel AAPL should try to challenge ath at some point between now and next ER. But as I said my guess is as good as anyone else’s :). Good luck with your trades!

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:19:40'] I might even trade a debit spread on this or a ratio spread to protect some capital from sideways trading, but I agree that IV expansion is likely. Its at a 20 IVR.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:27:39'] I think going long the underlying is better
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:42:36'] Huge Apple fan and shareholder the last couple years. While the innovation is great on the M1 and 5g super cycle, I still see them as overvalued and staying stagnant until they can grow their EPS more than they have been. Won’t sell all the shares I have but don’t plan on buying more for a while either
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 19:01:39'] Crowded trade. Just look elsewhere - plenty of great opportunities right now.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 19:23:39'] Maybe if they give me a free ipad....
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 20:00:29'] I'd buy one call itm and sell one call otm to get a call debit spread.  No vega or theta and you have a 50% chance of doubling your money
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 20:03:24'] I think AAPL is a tad overpriced.  Been selling 105, 107.5, and 110 puts depending where the stock is and that's doing nicely.  If it goes below 110, then I'm bringing out the calls.  105 and I'm going in hard with deep ITM calls.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 20:04:41'] I play apple weeklies as straddles, I buy premium each Friday for the +5$call, and the -4-5$put whatever is approximately the same cost as the call. I’ll usually profit off the put or call by Wednesday and taking whatever losses I incur on the other to the end. Though I’ve had a couple fun moments where I had my call go deep ITM followed the next day by my put going deep itm. Those are nice profitable weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 20:20:30'] I have Dec+ Calls. When they're ITM, I sell weekly covered calls against them to reduce cost. Look in to Poor Man's Covered Call by purchasing a ITM Call.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 21:15:11'] 27 contracts March apple calls $130. A bargain at $328 right now. Buying more. Will print.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-27 21:44:41'] Have mar and Jan. Been accumulating for the last couple of months. Likely breakout next week. We'll get a lot of chasers who will bid up vol, should make up for the theta bleed we've seen.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 10:37:37'] Reading examples on how to sell a covered call and it seems straight forward. In the latest example I have read - own 100 shares @$45 and sell a covered call for a month out at a strike price of $50 and collect a $100 premium, if it expires under $50 you keep the premium and if it hits the strike price it gets assigned and you make the $500 profit and keep the $100. Sounds GREAT !!! sign me up,When I try to apply this to stocks I already own the numbers just don't work. Not even getting close to these kinds of possibilities. What am I missing ? Are the numbers they give in this example just way to unrealistic to happen in most cases ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 11:15:24'] Not technically a question about options but I dont see a place where I can get it answeredIs there any possible reason why I should sit on SIVBQ and not sell it off for pennies ?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 11:55:54'] Fellow redditors, I am currently writing a Master thesis in option pricing based on BS, stochastic volatility models (and the CRR). What is the research question you might ask ? no idea. Stupid? yes. That's where if any of you want to come with any decent thing to investigate, both in theory and empirical, which is not hard to do because I suck, you would be a savoir and more than welcome to repond. Many thanks

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:58:45'] Hi, I’m trying to wrap my head around this. Why are naked calls/puts risky if you can buy the contract back before they go ITM? Or is this not possible. Is it essentially just shorting a contract therefore I can buy to cover at any time or am I thinking about this incorrectly?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 11:08:54'] Question about GreeksSo I know that gamma affects the rate of change in the delta. But there is no Greek that I know of that governs Theta. Is there a formula for calculating the rate of change in Theta?For example. If I have a credit spread with -0.05 Theta it's losing 0.05 per day in value. But that Theta changes over time as well. Accelerating as it gets closer to expiration.How do I figure out the rate of change in Theta?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 13:41:11'] Would anyone happen to know any software/online resource/database for graphing the historical prices of certain options contracts over time?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 15:37:37'] Trying to take advantage of IV crush. So i sold a put FRC $15.5 strike for $2.1 premium. Now that earnings are over iv should come crash down right? Thus lower the premium value?I'm not worried about assignment. I'm neutral to bullish on the stock.That is how it works right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 19:09:29'] I've been looking through a bunch of underlyings and it seems to me like IV is really low compared to other times. Now that I am aware of this it seems like a shitty time to be selling options since their price is so low. Does that mean it is a good time to be buying options? if so, what high probability strategies are there that you guys like to do?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 12:09:56'] 20% short interest seems to be considered significant. UPST is almost always at 40% short interest.  Why is it so high?  And why is pretty much 37% for months straight?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 13:30:33'] So if I plan on making a profit from buying a naked call option and when the stock goes up above my strike price and I decided to sell it and make a quick profit on the premium, will I be in trouble if the the new buyer of my option exercises his/her buy call option since I’m not covered? If yes why do a lot of people who buy naked call options which exceed the strike price, are at ease of mind when there’s still a risk of being held accountable for the to be delivered securities that they don’t own yet?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 13:45:59'] First Time Options Trader here. I bought 6 $2 Put contracts with a cost of .10 on 4/14 for FCEL. The expiration date is 5/5. Currently I am up 110% as FCEL is down to 1.88. The expiration is in 8 days. I believe that this stock could fall further. My questions are as follows: 1.) Should I worry about time decay with such a short term option? 2.) Risk is up to the individual but should I cut and run at this point? (Would you?)3.) When closing the position I am confused on the best way to go about it. Would I be better off selling the contracts or exercising them?4.) Is it unwise to wait until expiration if you are in the money? What happens if it expires and I do nothing?Thank you I know these are pretty basic questions. I retain information better by trial and error than reading and attempting to retain it all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 14:26:33'] I'm not new to options but if I have a lot left to learn. I was confused today. I impulsally bought a MCK $360 4/28 p for 1.50 mid day. I never seen such a large difference in bid and asking price, I think it was 2.00 asking and 1.05 bid at the time for some reason( I'm not smart) I bid 1.50 instead of 1.10 and got filled immediately. Anyways the strangest thing happened toward EOD. The stock shot up $2 in a matter of minutes but here's the kicker, so did the price of my put. Im very confused

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 16:02:01'] How does max loss work with an iron Condor if it expires between the put or call spread? For instance, if opened a Spy condor at 400/402/420/422 then my max loss should be $200 minus the credit from the trade. But if spy expires at 401, then I will have my 402 puts exercised and the 400 puts will expire out of the money. So now I will need to pay $40.1k to buy the shares which there is no guarantee they will be at that price when the market reopens to let me sell at market rates.So, the max loss isn't accurate. What am I missing here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 20:43:57'] when buying spreads, do you recommend having the long position ITM, therefore buying one with a Prob ITM of around 70% which means there is a high chance of profit, or do you do something else?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 10:04:33'] I'm using ToS and sold a call credit spread for CVS. The overall position shows a loss of $174 but the individual positions show that the call I sold has lowered in price, it's P/L being $63. The call I bought also lowered in price and it's P/L is -$33. Shouldn't the overall P/L be a positive since the money I'm making on the sold call is more than what I'm losing on the long one?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:39:37'] New trader here and had great success in March/April just selling some basic spreads and getting used to the mechanics in small dollar amounts.  I'm about 20 trades in (all profitable!) and just had my first short leg challenged and so it was my first time making an adjustment. IWM put credit spread for May 5, 2023 expiry with 172/170 strike price for an original credit of $32.  Trade moved against me this week, so yesterday when it was about 1% out of the money with the short side showing a delta of 0.35 or so, I decided to make an adjustment by putting a call credit spread on to make it an iron condor.  Sold a far OTM 181/183 call credit spread for $28 premium (which is currently quite profitable). Today, IWM continues to go down and we breach the strike with a current market price of $171.34.  I roll the position by one week to May 12th for a $0.00 net to give it a bit more time to recover.  I believe most traders will only roll if they receive a net credit.Question - did I ever overadjust here by doing both the IC and the roll?  Would you have just closed the position?  In retrospect, as the stock continues to go down, I think rolling without a credit was a mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:50:27'] What is the best way to buy/sell to close an option?    I have been doing market, but afraid that I’m overpaying.    I have been experimenting with limit and trying to make a few cents on bid/ask. I had a SPY butterfly where I got assigned because my limit didn’t fill. For a cool $41,000. Luckily, it was my paper trade not my real account.   What do most experienced traders use?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 11:51:23'] Question. I have a company stock purchase program I participate in, which has put my portfolio overweight in that particular sector.  I would like to sell some of the shares now that they are unrestricted and buy some tech to balance the portfolio. Long term, I feel good about the future of the company. If I sit on the shares for a while, I’m ok with that. If I am going to sell 100 shares, any reason I shouldn’t sell a covered call just otm if I’m comfortable selling at that price if it hits? And any reason not to sell a call 1 year out vs 1 month out and get a larger premium if it hits?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 04:25:12'] Does anyone have experience with Option EOD data from CBOE (https://datashop.cboe.com/option-eod-summary)? I want to find IV (side question: is IV and IV30 same?) for a ticker. But when I look at the data for a specific quote date the IV is different for all sort of expiration days and deltas. My main question is when someone say IV of a ticker for a specific quote\_date which strike and delta do they mean? Why they are all different?

POST_TEXT: b"Made a pretty big move last week that I already kind of regret. I dropped about 48k into AAPL Jan 2022 leaps. I like to buy ITM to lessen theta, but should have thought more about the break even price of $140. Over the past week I've had less and less confidence in this play. I've started to think AAPL is overvalued, and even if good news does continue to come out, it's already a 2.1 trillion dollar company. What's left to catalyze this stock to a bigger market cap? \n\nThen you have the vaccine. Money will surely be taken out of tech stocks like Apple and allocated into beat down stocks. I should have thought about this play harder. What's your take on it?\n\nAlso, I'm thinking about selling some weekly calls against it, but can't decide if I should just abandon the position.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 06:33:05'] Since you posted this on r/options Im less inclined to troll you. You post this on wsb Ill tell you to diamond hand it and laugh at you when you lose it all. Seriously if you're losing sleep its not worth it and just sell it for a loss. It's not a bad bet but at the end of the day options are just bets. Nobody here can tell you whats going to happen to the stock price. It sounds like you want out though so just sell.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 06:30:48'] I  am holding AAPL calls myself for 3/19/21 so I may be biased.Check out your position on OptionsProfitCalculator: [http://opcalc.com/iSS](http://opcalc.com/iSS). I'm eyeing a price target of mid-130s, which would give you a good bit of runway into 2021. We should also expect eye-popping Christmas sales which may give you a January bump to rotate out to something else if you're already getting cold feet. Regretting a LEAP after a week may indicate you weren't too solid on it in the first place. Or alternatively if you're dropping 50k into one position I'd go way deeper into the money to guard against the stock trading sideways for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 07:14:35'] Depending on how far in the money you are, turn this into a poor mans covered call. Start selling weekly calls at 40 delta. Rinse and repeat.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 08:11:27'] Sell OTM calls to make a passive income.  If they get assigned, hey, your LEAP just did very well.  I'd say .2 or .3 delta is safe enough.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 17:38:08'] You are good. I’ve been following AAPL price movement for years. The current stall is not a long term issue. AAPL as a company is still growing globally. That’s the important part. As we navigate through the pandemic and distribute vaccines price action will creep up. Stimulus gets passed after inauguration and earnings will be another catalyst. Historically APPL continues to have YOY stock price growth. It’s as close to a sure thing as you can get. But you have to absorb pullbacks and market fluctuations. We can’t control that. Sell weekly calls. Bring your cost down and relax. It’s a LEAP not a TSLA  weekly FD. If you expected to get a 150% return on this position in a week you are mistaken and spend too much time in r/wallstreetbets
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 01:57:40'] Wait tilll next earnings then sell before.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 06:23:31'] You could make over 20k selling weeklies against your leaps.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 07:58:05'] Solid play, but I think you will need to be really patient.  My expectation is that AAPL will be a slow ride in 2021.Margin expansion and performance from new in-house chipsets should be favorable though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 11:39:04'] Apple is not going to go down much and it has tremendous upside.  Re-evaluate the position when your 6 months from expiration and sell calls along the way to reduce the call costs.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 16:44:16'] If you are worried about a 7% loss on this position, I can almost guarantee you have too much size on. I would recommend reducing contracts, not because I'm bearish on AAPL, but I suspect you are risking too much of your account. If I'm way off, just ignore the above and read others' opinions on AAPL 😀
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 07:36:11'] Stick with a .8 delta or greater next time, you may pay a little more in premium. Just my 2 pennies worth. Also, yea you should sell covered calls against it that are way out of the money to lower your overall cost basis. Theta won’t start to effect you until the last 6 months of the option life! Good luck and happy trading!

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 13:00:49'] I’d agree that they are somewhat overvalued currently, but with all the new technology they are developing over the next year or two I wouldn’t worry too much about being down temporarily.Unless the economy takes another downturn I can’t see them not hitting all time highs again within a year even if it’s temporary.I’d agree on selling some weekly or monthly covered calls right now. I’d suggest selling at at least the $140 strike though so if they spiked you wouldn’t have to execute your leaps for a lossEdit: January 8th 2021 $140 calls look decent to sell to cut down your potential loss slightly
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 14:42:04'] Why not sell the $130 or $140 C and turn this into a vertical spread?  Lower your breakeven?

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 15:29:25'] Always have an exit plan when entering any position.  You entered this position at a weird time, 2 huge IPO’s and a STIM stalemate. Hang in there and you’ll be fine. If you’re losing sleep over this then sell and get into something smaller.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 16:30:44'] You need to be patient. If you bought leaps over a year out, you have to give it a bit of time to work
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-12 17:38:44'] The long expiration date makes me think you can get a green day to close out (at or near) your paid price, Apple is a good company with ridiculous margins, making moves into the VR and chip space, I do think the company is one of a kind

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 04:26:54'] I have AAPL stock (2190 shares)I would just hold it until the next quarter when the iPhone 12 profit taken into account.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-20 19:34:19'] You should for sell calls against it. You have so much time to be right or wrong here. I am guessing you can whittle the cost down considerably and maybe even drive a profit just off the PMCC's. Typically Leaps have a lower time premium on the second year anyways. I bought the Mar19 130/140 call vertical in November and I am liking how it is tracking now.Don't pay attention to people telling you to stick your head in the sand that the sky is falling. There are usually trying to sell you something. Equities are clearly 'risk on' right now.  So much money out there looking for a home. Apple is a least a good company with a cult like devotion from its customers.

For the next time you are trying to scalp or swing, I would suggest using a trailing stop order. It locks in profits as you go up and if stock falls below a certain percentage or dollar amount from the high, if will limit sell your shares or options towards the top. Good way of making sure you stay green. Congrats!

POST_TEXT: b"Played AAPL earnings for two quarters. It's been the same both times (third time's the charm?). There is always a run up until right before earnings then it stagnates/drop post earnings.\n\nEarnings will likely be good since we know iPhone orders will be good and new products (even potential EV market entry hints). Not to mention their dominance in the app store market. Take for example Match whose biggest expense is paying AAPL 500M+ in fees to the app store anually.\n\nEarnings: Post quarterly earnings of $0.99 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +54.7%.\n\nRevenues are expected to be $77.62 billion, up 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.\n\n**Price Target**: 136-140 going to next week's earnings. 140+ if news cycle decides to pump AAPL \n\n*Technical/Astrology:* \n\n\\- Going to retest 135 this week and run up until earnings\n\n\\- Cup and Handle forming, today the handle was maintained as the stock rose and reclaimed 133.50, Green Hammer seen as well, indicat"
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 04:27:07'] Yeah, the market is just weird on AAPL earnings.  The stock runs sky high in advance of earnings.  Then earnings beat everyone's expectations.  Then the stock collapses.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 07:46:10'] Although in the last two earnings reports AAPL was largely unresponsive to earnings, in the one before that (July 30, 2020) AAPL had a massive response to earnings producing yields on a straight strangle of above 100% (I have posted the details of this event on other posts in this sub).In the four events prior to that (31Jul19, 30Oct19, 28Jan20, and 30Apr20) AAPL did not have an eventful report, BUT in the four before that AAPL had significant responses in all four. I have played AAPL earnings in every quarter except two in the last four years and on net AAPL has paid well, because, with the exception of the very last quarter, losses could be kept relatively small with good trading, while some of the gains were epic, especially the 26Jul20 report.The relatively low cost of near-expiry ATM (slight OTM) options for AAPL makes this stock a good ground for experimentation for those of you just starting out. ATM option strangles  this morning are priced at about $680 per contract, far less than other tech examples like TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, or NFLX (which just paid well yesterday). This is a cheap way to experiment with strangles, or if you want to go the other way, iron condors. I do not recommend shorting strangles (unhedged) with AAPL because there would have been many trades in the past where such a strategy would have had terrible results.  [edit: typos]

I'll bet you that block closes a position opened before the split (back on 8/25 15k traded for $7.85 with stock near $500- those would convert to 60k of the 112.50 strike).   Today's 2.66 price compares to a split-adjusted entry of 1.96- would be a loss of 70c or $4.2M- will update after new open interest data is released tonight!

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-16 14:56:14'] WSJ shows short interest increasing by 236% as of 8/30 as compared to the prior period 2 weeks earlier.  NakedShortReport (reliable?) shows the % short volume went from about 5M shares per day Aug 26-Aug 28 up to 24M on Aug 31 and they show it above 17M per day ever since.  Maybe the price stays flat until short volume drops off.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 17:49:02'] With the VIX down and IV low, this is the perfect time to buy leaps. You are locking in long term low premium options.You just need to decide what delta to enter at.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 17:12:48'] I’m holding shares and leaps. I think going the full 2 years out is the best bet. It’s the most expensive but offers the least risk. What strike are you considering doing?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 15:46:30'] Which LEAP to buy is based on several considerations:Calculate the cost per day of the various LEAPs of the same strike price.  You can use an option chain to guesstimate the theta decay for the the number of months b/t various expirations.100 shares will always make more than one call LEAP. Leveraging total dollars in LEAPs will make more: or example, 100 shares versus two call LEAPS with same dollar investment.A call LEAP will have less risk than 100 shares if share price craters.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 14:48:06'] Options are betting.  If you’re willing to buy, it means there is someone else out there willing to bet the opposite.  It’s hard to predict what apples price will be in 2 years.  That’s why I’m more a fan of covered option strategies - either puts or calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 20:40:12'] I opened LEAPs on AAPL two weeks ago, now is still a good time (I'll keep holding them for a while).If you can, turn your LEAP into a PMCC by selling a call against your LEAP. Even selling the CC way OTM (0.1 delta) will net a solid return. The liquidity on AAPL is great too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-07 05:31:55'] Good sir, I would not recommend APPL leaps. I would simply buy shares (100 @ a time) and sell covered calls. You make money both ways and you can exclaim to your friends " I'm an Apple share holder". Be well!

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 15:38:00'] A lot of people will tell you about how they have been burned waiting for more profits and then watching it go away. So i'd say if you're confident the share price will go up leading up to the event/earnings you can hold onto them. If not, you can either close both early and secure profits, or you can sell one of them, wait to see how the one you are still holding does, and stop loss it while you're still in profits or ride the wave up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 15:55:14'] Safest bet is holding up till just before earnings as IV will come up a ton and make those calls worth even more. You could hold through earnings, but that’s a a big gamble: bad news and it’ll lose value fast, good news might increase price a bit but you could still lose money due to IV drop off.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 16:34:48'] Roll it into higher strike and slightly longer dated calls for a credit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:21:31'] It never hurts taking profits. Over a 100% gain is a good day for anyone.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:51:16'] Most people here are giving you advice on what they would do, and I agree with them (no-one ever went broke taking profits). But you asked whether the premium would increase with stock price, and this has a clear answer: delta. Delta describes how many dollars the option value increases for a dollar increase in the underlying stock. ITM calls have a delta approaching 1, so yes, their value will increase with the stock's price. You are fighting theta (the decay of option value as expiry nears) though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:18:35'] I would hold your apple calls till April 26th and get extra premium from selling in High IV environment.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:20:03'] I thought that I saw that pre earnings the IV gets super pumped up by the MM’s and then after it drops way off making it harder to gain traction on a good earnings report for a call! But from what I was reading the IV will pump it way up before but please do your own DD on this cuz I don’t want to mislead you based on something I read in a Reddit post. Look into it though. It’s worth knowing for your own benefit. Let me know if you can Track down any information about it because I would be curious to know myself since I am holding a couple of Apple calls that are in the money already
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:52:44'] Sell one let the other ride should be what everyone is saying...That ensures about 50% profit across the trade even if the other plummets.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:25:04'] Ugh, I averaged down hard on my 4/16  125 and 126.25 calls when AAPL was taking a dump a few weeks ago. Watched my position go down to -80%, but I was sure as shit it would pop before earnings. But what do I do? I sold wayyyy too early, and I missed out on I don't wanna say how much. But I'm holding my June calls for a while longer, probably sell most before earnings. We're just about to hit 70 on the RSI, so I'd be careful of holding anything expiring soon. i'm expecting a dip likely before earnings and almost surely after. Even if the report is good. Maybe even if it's *really* good.AAPL is kinda fun, but jesus man, I'm not sure I've ever seen anything loose value as fast and gain it as slowly (until the past week or so). Maybe PLTR is more annoying, unless it pops like it did today it seems calls AND puts are perpetually in the red. I mean, aren't puts supposed to gain value when the stock price drops 5 percent? Maybe I oughta go back and review the basics...
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:34:14'] I just wanted to add that the further in the money your call goes the more and faster your option value (premium) will increase. You Delta will get bigger and bigger the farther into the money your call moves. You’re getting “farther” from the share price but in the right direction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-17 11:19:38'] Hi, I am actually quite bullish on AAPL but new to options trading, generally product launch event will lead to stock prices drop, how likely is it this time, maybe we could use some strategy to hedge?

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 20:22:29'] Sell monthly calls against them in the meantime to lower your cost basis.  AAPL is a great company but the overall market isn’t looking to hot so far this year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 23:55:08'] Strategy A: Minimize the losses, for beginners1. Depends how much of your portfolio that represents. It may not be worth it to take a small risk (if so, you shouldn't have entered the trade, but you know that know...)2. Looking at historical data transforms hopes into statistics. If you have a backtesting software, simluate a buy for each year, follow the option price throughout the year. This will tell you the probability of:a. It will only get worse, better sell now.b. It will improve. You may not break even but you can limit the damage.3. Each year has been different. Factor the specific positives and negatives for this year. Investors are leaving the tech stocks because of inflation fears. You need them back, and also good news from Apple. When people will get back to their offices, they may get more optimistic. But how risky is the wait?Based on these 3 points, I would:1. Define a real stop loss. An option value you need to exit no matter what. You may have crossed that line already. You may configure this as a price alert or through your broker.2. Configure a Good-til-cancel Contingent order that triggers a Trailing Stop Loss. Once the price of the option reaches your exit price, the trailing will make sure you finish surfing that wave before exiting.3. Then forget about it.Strategy B: slowly recover losses using shortsA more advanced strategy, would be to use your losing long calls as hedge for short ones, for instance enter weekly calendar spreads.If you say you are 40% down on a call at 150 currently at $5.45 you must have got them around $9... at a time with much higher IV probably.The first good effect is that every time you sell an option it reduces and locks your maximum loss if AAPL goes further down.If AAPL goes up slowly, the call will expire worthless and you'll make money slowly.If AAPL goes up fast, and that's the real added risk now, you'll have to roll the calls over (be careful of early assignments). You have increased your losses. The key is that your strategy will work most of times. But you have to practice.How much can you hope?You know for sure that if the stock doesn't move, you'll lose $900 per call. There are 36 weeks between now and Jan 22. You have to make $25 per week to break even, and again assuming the stock doesn't go up. If the stock goes up, your call increases in value so you don't need to earn as much. Your short calls have to keep expiring worthless though.The IV is super low for AAPL now, so you can't do miracles. If you sell a $134 call for 5/14 and you win, you'll make $32. The delta is only 16, only roughly have 75% chances only to win.Shorting a $135 call gives you only $20, with 80%+ chances.$134 is close to $130, so you need to make sure this makes sense. A poor man's backtesting is to put your chart in candlestick over 3 years with weekly points and count how many times the stock has increased more than 4 points (or the % equivalent) between the Open and the Close of the week, divide by 52\*3 and it gives your probability (exclude earnings).But it will get better with time, for these reasons:* Getting closer to earnings will increase the IV and the premium of the calls you sell. Don't let your short open over an earning though. It would be stupid to lose money because AAPL jumps up, which is kind of what you wanted in the first place.* If the AAPL goes down after you shorted your weekly call, to a point you have reached your target of $25, exit (with a stop loss if you fancy). Then sell another call with the same delta. Statistically, this will happen several times.* If the stock slowly creeps up, at some point you're going to be close to your break even point. You may just sell or enter a final credit spread to make a (small) profit.If you don't understand any of this, I would recommend not doing it.If you are not sure, use a backtest application for training this until you understand how to do it, what are the best deltas and time spreads, how to react if the stock rallies, how to negotiate earnings, when the IV is too low that it's not worth it, etc. It may not be worth it at all.Even if you lose money, you'll lose probably less than if you close now, and you will have learned a lot about how to make money with options with more statistics and less gambling.

I cut all trades at 30% loss no matter what. 20% if I have low conviction and 10% on momentum plays with no conviction. You bought otm or maybe ATM options? Ask yourself why you did that. Was it company fundamentals? I can't see how with APPL, stagnated products and mediocre revenue with supply chain problems and in a very competitive market. Was it momentum? Was it hype?Whatever the reason, if your conviction is gone and you have lost almost half your money, I would have cut my losses prior this point.Even if you still have conviction, you are down so far breakeven is near impossible. Even if you did breakeven that capital is locked up for many more months making no money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 19:55:01'] The year is not even half over yet (6/30) and you are thinking about throwing in the towel... Go ahead call it quits, (AAPL closed at 130.21)Next time paper trade. Or don't buy LEAP; buy some weekly. Know what you are getting into. Else come back Nov or Dec and ask this question again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 19:45:35'] Nothing wrong with 🍎 I THINK It is MAYBE the fear of inflation that is negatively impacting the markets, specially tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 19:54:16'] What is your exit strategy for the trade? Have the parameters been met?
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 20:30:49'] Apple has the largest market cap of any company on US stock exchanges. It'll take a 10% increase for your positions to turn a profit.Do you picture anything happening that will make Apple 10% more valuable by the end of the year? For example, there's been some speculation about an Apple Car that could rocket the price beyond all comprehension if it's announced. Is that a better bet than all the other things you could do with your money? Otherwise, it's hard for me to picture a catalyst that will lift AAPL above 140, given the market response to their latest product announcement and earnings report following a huge bull run.If you want to bet on some major news coming from the company before January, hold your LEAPs. Otherwise, there are a lot of other stocks with better upside potential in that timeframe.Don't be afraid of selling at a loss if necessary. It just means you can put your money somewhere else that you think is less likely to keep losing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 10:05:09'] I won't give you advice, but what I'll say is that AAPL is pretty undervalued. My brother, it's trading at a lower forward P/E than McDonald's. McDonald's is a great business and McChicken's are not to be trifled with, but what the fuck? Not only that, but it's up like 1% YTD. AAPL should not be trading this low. Its ecosystem and hardcore fanbase gives it a very wide moat while its subscription services continue to rapidly grow. Furthermore, it's become a chip maker and its M1 chips have made Intel obsolete while providing as much value as AMD chips.Given this, if you decide to sell, you should base your decision on broader market forces (e.g. impending market crash). Otherwise, I would HODL, but you do you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 10:29:21'] If you want to paper hand, at least wait until after the iPhone event in September. Definitely gonna get a move on around that time. Plus IV‘s gonna be juicy as well.Besides, 12-month price target for Apple is what, 170$? Relax, you‘re doing good. ;)

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 15:47:34'] I would say watch some videos on YouTube on PMCC & executing LEAP trades. There are some really good explanations so you are better prepared for the next ones you try.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 17:02:57'] Man i dont know how ppl do ATM/OTM LEAPS lol. I have Deep ITM LEAPS that i hold. Way safer but you do have to pay more premium. I like deep ITM because of the low extrinsic value compare to intrinsic. (It mimics the underlying very well)&#x200B;To answer your question just like what everyone else is saying sell covered calls against it. Trust me i know the premiums are low for CCs (due to low IV) but it just helps you pay down the debt of the premiums. &#x200B;Remember AAPL is not underperforming cause of AAPL its the market and the fear of inflation, interest rates etc. Tech in general is getting hammered. I would hold on to your LEAPS and take a chance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 20:04:58'] no its apple, the market will rise
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-09 07:53:59'] Again, this must be a brokerage difference, because most brokerages hold collateral for a credit spread the width of the strikes. It doesn't matter if he is already long or not. Risk management for a spread is to have the collateral for the width in the event of both being itm. This is because to close a spread with both legs itm you need the capital to buy the width. So to be clear, if the broker doesn't force that risk management you are correct. If they do, he needs collateral.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 23:49:20'] Wait for a good green day in the next two weeks and offload them all. Don’t gamble on OTM options.Here’s how to make decent money with options. Sell near expiration  ATM and OTM credit spreads, get that theta working for you. This is higher risk/reward, but also higher probability.Buy options for short term trading at least 60 DTE at .90 delta. This is a synthetic stock position, costs about 25% of underlying value, but moves like crazy with the market. Get out by 45 DTE. Look at it as 4x margin for free.People are slow to buy expensive options because they don’t understand how their price moves. Buy the popular .12 delta OTM option (aka gamble) and if you’re right about the direction you gain $12 per dollar movement of the underlying (up to .50 delta as you cross into the money if you even make it to ATM), that’s usually just enough to offset your decay. Buy a deep ITM option at the .90 delta and you get $90 per dollar movement of the underlying (and it only gets better as it goes in your favor)

POST_TEXT: b'I have traditionally been a buy and hold type investor and it has worked out well for me so far, particularly on AAPL, but I am looking to start leveraging the gains I have made to start trading options. I am thinking of starting to run the wheel on AAPL but I am concerned about the large tax bill from long term capital gains.\n\nI have held AAPL for about 8 years and my cost basis is $15.22 a share with 880 shares (current value ~$150k). I can start writing covered calls but when the day finally comes and I get assigned I am looking at a big tax bill on ~$138k of capital gains (and I live in California). \n\nInstead of the wheel I could also just write covered calls exclusively and just roll up and/or out to avoid the tax bill.\n\nI am still new to options trading and have been trying to do my research and learning on different strategies. I would appreciate suggestions on strategies I should look into more.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 07:00:08'] Can you just run the wheel with half your shares? Not as much premium collected but still let’s you dabble.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 07:15:09'] Covered calls to take some profit without increase in taxes or risk, and roll up and out if they are ITM a few days before expiration, is often a good idea. Make sure they are \_qualified\_ covered calls though, to avoid complexity, and to be able to write off loss on them if AAPL moons. Be prepared for what you'll do if AAPL does moon -- one option you'll have if calls are qualified is to sell some shares while rolling calls up, gain on AAPL offsetting rolls on calls. But don't take my word for it, do some what-if scenarios.&#x200B;Edit: I also don't know whether California follows federal rules on this. Most states do, so my guess would be it does, but I know nothing of California taxes. Also if CCs go deep ITM, watch early assignment around ex-dividend date. Can always roll them before it if extrinsic is low enough for it to be a real possibility. Also be prepared for the loss on the calls if AAPL moons. You'll have overall gain on position, but need to prepare for what to do if rolling calls costs you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 14:52:05'] I doubt you'll earn enough in short options to pay your taxes which will mean you'll need to sell shares to cover taxes incurring more taxes. Rolling is not really going to help you a whole lot imo as while you can say you'll just keep rolling up and out, eventually you'd reach a point where you would have to roll for a debit just to avoid a tax bill. Better idea would just be to open up a fresh account and run options in the other account with funds you don't have so much time value invested into.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 23:48:51'] We both have something in common 😹 I’m doing the same thing as you. I’m sitting on massive unrealized gains in my AAPL positions and last year I started selling CCs on the position as a way to tap some of these gains. I sell deep OTM though and I’m very conservative rather aggressive. Also, I’m ok if some of my CCs are exercised. I’ve actually used the money I collect in premiums to add to my Apple position or start new positions which LOWERS RISK and JUICES GAINS. I also have the mindset of buy and hold. Short term unrealized losses don’t scare me. Know the company and their fundamentals and you’re ok. I’ve had 50%+ unrealized losses before and wasn’t worried because I knew the stock would recover based on fundamentals. Time is OUR FRIEND. Worse case scenario: you’re wrong and suffer a loss. Just use that loss to offset your capital gains tax 😹 the system is setup in our favor to TAKE RISK! Know how to play the game and pick and choose your spots. Take Charlie Mungers advice, know what you are competent at and avoid what you’re not.

Sell put spreads could help you benefit from all the IV being sucked out. Calendar spreads are great if you expect it to stay in a range. One of my best trades was a short front month long back month call. Same strike. So many trades to place outside of just buying calls. Most long calls lose money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 13:24:29'] Not a bad play but currently 21 JAN 22 120C are around $15.50. I have a target to buy 10 at $15 to get a 135b/e pt. Then short OTM calls 3-4 weeks out to reduce my b/e even more. Goal Is to sell by Sept for 2x.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 15:44:21'] If I'm doing leaps, I personally prefer 2 years before expiration since since they aren't all that much more pricey than the 1 year ones. I just loaded up on a few 80c expiring March 2023 at 47.50 that I'm feeling good about.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 13:22:47'] Look for AAPL to pull back to the 200SMA in the next few weeks and then bounce. I would look to buy a call on a down day when AAPL pulls back to around $117.  No idea about RBLX. I know a lot of parents that are mega bullish on it. I have not looked into it enuff. This is only my opinion and not financial advice. I could be 100% wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 17:44:09'] I would recommend going 100c January or March 23 (whichever had better liquidity).  This gives you around .7-.8 delta so you can safely run PMCCs.  The extra bit ITM also makes the BE "easy"I have 1 of each.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 02:54:24'] I think itd be a wiser decision to sell a call if you have  a large enough position. Theres 2 mottos that always burn me: A stock that reaches an ATH tends to keep rising. A stock that rraches an all time low tends to keep tumbling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 04:12:30'] Pro - apple is one of the most liquid tradable stocks for options.Con - one of the most successful companies of all time. Why not pick a shit company like Nikola who has to push their vehicles downhill to get any movement. A lot of bearish talk. Many people are starting to feel uneasy and wish to capitalize on the downside. Another consideration you may wish to make is to buy a put on another company that is in the same sector that has the same cycles as Apple. I would aim for a company with higher volatility. So, if you are right you would see a larger swing. If you are wrong apple is slowly going to erode your puts. It feels unlikely to me that apple will have a down week because it hit an all time high- and similar tech companies would not have the same resistance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 04:31:46'] What's your AAPL position and what price were you in? If you loaded up while it was dicking around in the $120's (as you should have) you'll want to ride the rocket to space. Like someone else said sell some covered calls if you're confident in a pullback here. I'd be looking at getting some QQQ puts rather than AAPL puts. I'm starting to grab some SPY puts for the inevitable pullback from the current high, but things could still run up beginning of next week. Best way I've found to cash in on a AAPL pullback is a short term strangle position. Vix is low, but AAPL options are a bit expensive because of it's recent movement. I'd go slightly ITM on the call and a buck away on the put. If it keeps running up the calls are already ITM, if it pulls back then both options will gain some value with the volatility spike. (Of course Monday morning is not the best time for buying a strangle, better to buy those Friday at 3:50ish)My main point is if you're aboard AAPL gravy train stay on board and look for other ways to profit from a short term pullback in the stock price. Don't restrict your long position. Remember the run up before the last split? When it runs you gotta go with it or get left behind. - Ben
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 05:48:24'] You could, but they have earnings in a couple of weeks so I would expect a run up until then.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 04:44:23'] Don’t waste your money on AAPL puts. Yes, there is always a chance of a pull back, but Apple has a two decade track record of making higher highs after the pull back. As others have said, write cover calls if you are concerned. The worse that can happen is the stock gets assigned, and then you can wait for a pull back to buy again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 05:02:15'] I think there are huge amounts of 150C options for next week. Seems people are bullish on AAPL now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 03:50:36'] Guh
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-11 11:19:48'] I’ve never considered an ath as major resistance.  Major resistance would be a level a stock has reached and pulled back on three times.  What is in an AAPL chart RIGHT NOW that suggests a pull back to you.I wouldn’t be surprised if AAPL raises its dividend with the earnings announcement and it pops up even further.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 20:37:35'] My rule : never buy spy and apple puts. Just buy calls when they are down. Big correction, buy longer dated calls. Small correction, buy short dated calls. If I’m expecting a market correction, I can go with puts on iwm and qqq or tqqq, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 12:36:47'] If you look at the past 2 years, AAPL has never gotten hammered….it pulls down, consolidates, continues it stair step climb.  I guess you could benefit from a short term pullback, but if you are looking for a crash, you are gonna be disappointed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 19:27:19'] The trick is to sell your shares of aapl at 120 like I did.  Then you don’t have to worry because you will hate yourself to much to buy back in.  Easy peasy
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:41:05'] I can tell you one thing: The last time AAPL calls where at that price, the underlying was 5$ lower. Look at the IV - if anything you should probably be buying end of the year/autumn calls right now and wait for the IV to go up during the upcoming event and earnings.I know I would if I didn‘t already have some. :DAlso, I don‘t think Apple‘s gonna go down much. They were in a dip and it‘s probably gonna be a nice run towards the September iPhones from here on out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:33:56'] I bought spy options this morning and sold it in the afternoon
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:48:53'] I've been watching AAPL and MSFT respectively since end of February. Both had a great run but plateaued somewhat. MSFT didnt skip a beat afterwards and I was able to ride some great calls until today. I guess emotions coincided because I personally hate Apple so instead of picking it up at $118 which I recall was its lowest as it limbo'd at $120 for a while I just watched it. And just now is it starting to pick up steam. Although MSFT has already been chugging along.I know too much of a good thing is an understatement when it comes to green days but those stocks reflect 2 of the major markets so you can only imagine if they push through SPY is flying too. I'm a pussy though and wont go weekly on SPY from my past errors when I first started. Who knows if things do dip down I may be humble enough to have faith for another run. Unless it just keeps ripping and bears r fuk.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 21:01:15'] Every week a few posts on /r/options speculate about a new strategy or try to capitalize on near term catalysts. Most of the time when I've tried to do this, I've made modest gains. My largest gains were from leaps I acquired when IV was low. I'm talking three years out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-10 04:21:20'] Basically we have 2 weeks before AAPL presents the Financial report for 2nd Q2021.All the predictions from hedgefunds and banks are showing the increase in price and Buy recomendation with $152 price target. I not saying they are right but before AAPL presents the report the price goes up.I have calls and I am not selling until the price goes up to 140 at least. I don't have a cristal ball but I believe AAPL still have room to go up.My bet, not financial advise.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:50:39'] Agree that a play on the run up to Apple earnings may be your best bet here. I’d dump em before the 28th to hopefully lock in some profits before IV drops. I’d grab some for early May if you’re lucky enough to get a small pull back this week. Could possibly do a short calendar spread if you want to limit your risk.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 21:26:06'] Just buy puts if you think too late. As these drop, the put grows in value. Sell once you have captured enough on the way down before they climb back up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-10 09:32:42'] On a long enough timeline, I'm highly confident SPY will be higher than it is today...If you are new, I recommend reading and understanding Option Volatility & Pricing by Natenberg.  If books are terrifying, study up with [optionseducation.org](https://optionseducation.org)  Once you have a strong foundation, you will know how to best set up option trades to match your outlook on SPY, AAPL, MSFT (or any other optionable symbol).
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-10 16:20:30'] I would say nothing keeps going up. Actually the S&P actually hit the top channel line at 4 PM Friday and fell 10 handles after the bell. Don’t be surprised if we have either a sideways day or down on Monday and if the CPI on Tuesday is as strong or stronger than the PPI we have a correction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-10 09:59:18'] I know more expensive- but if you’re looking to get onto tech that still has promising runs look to google & Amazon. The charts on them are primed. If buying money is tighter, play vertical spreads on them. If you’re looking for just one of the three you listed, I like Apple like someone else said.

POST_TEXT: b'First, Happy Thanksgiving to all. So I was curious what most of you recommend on this. I purchased Apple a few months ago at 142 and have sold CCs on it since... I sold the Jan 170 call and I feel like it will surpass this by Jan at this point.  I want to hold my shares long term and not lose them - so if it does go ITM is it more practical to keep rolling the 170 for small credits to the next month, or just letting it expire and then selling a 170 cash secured put?  I sold the 15 delta 45dte, wayyy OTM and Apple still had a crazy run here!'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 11:13:13'] Firstly, if you want to hold your shares long term and not lose them, dont sell CC's! Come on now! One of these days they'll release that damn Apple car and you'll have really messed up haha. So, I'd probably roll if holding them was priority #1. Maybe wait till January and buy back for a loss if it crosses 170.But if It were me, I would let the position ride only because I think AAPL will come back down. It may never hit 170 by January. Or if it does, it will prolly come back for a chance to re-enter at some point. But, thats just my opinion and I could be very wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 11:08:14'] Why not just close your position early once you’ve turned a bit of a profit? I
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 11:57:42'] Hold it through expiry. If it goes in the money, you can just roll it up and out. If it is right around $170 at expiry, you’ll have crushed it. If it’s below, calls go out worthless and you still have the shares if you want them. The only real loser is having it blow through 170. But that’s not even a “loser”.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 11:23:05'] I have a 175 Jan. 17 PMCC, that I’m letting ride, fwiw. I’d probably sit in a170, if I had one, but keep a close eye on it and roll out and up as necessary. Ymmv.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 12:02:11'] If you want to hang on to your shares (and it might be better for you tax-wise - check with your tax advisor) then I would roll those short calls out. You will always get the roll for a credit if you use the same strike or you might tweak it to your liking if you decide to use a different strike price in which case you might do it for even, for a credit or even for a debit (if for example you roll them up and out)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 14:29:48'] Once, I had AMD \~$20.  I sold calls at 20.  It spent some time \~$22, then dropped to \~$18.  I considered buying back the calls, but I thought I'd gamble on it closing below $20 at expiration.Then it started taking off.  I started rolling the calls.  About a year ago, I was short the Jan '23, 28-strike calls.  AMD was \~$70.There is a point where you can't really roll the calls anymore.I was rolling for a net credit each time, BTW.

POST_TEXT: b"Hello!\n\n\nI'm pretty bullish on Apple, and I think they're going to keep growing for quite some time. Since I dont have 12k lying around to buy 100 shares, I thought it a good idea to try a PMCC on AAPL.\n\nI'd like to buy the 85C expiring 21Jan 2022, it has a high delta of 87 and is going to cost about $3845.\n\nAccording to Optionsprofitcalculator, if Apple expires at above $124/share it's going to be profitable. Pair this with selling calls, I can't see how this can fail? Unless Apple really gets beaten down from this market selloff, or it plummets for some reason."
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-27 22:23:22'] Check the wiki guys, there is a detailed post on PMCC by our moderators. It talks about what is PMCC and how to select your strikes. I will update here if I find it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-27 20:19:36'] I have question if someone could answer:I got a $120 Jan 2023 call for $23.50 a couple weeks ago making my breakeven $143.50.I would like to sell CC's against the option -- should I be selling calls to be at least $145 SP so I breakeven? At this time the May 21st $145 call is 0.70.OR did I mess up and should I be buying deep ITM long calls like the OP did?Btw, OP -- what's the next call you are selling? 20 dte? Price/premium?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-27 16:24:52'] You dont need the calculator to figure out your breakeven at expiration. Just add the premium to the strike price. The way it can fail is if AAPL keeps going down. What kind of strikes/dates are you looking at for your short legs? Do you want to sell weeklies, monthlies?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-28 05:38:48'] The good thing about the PMCC is that if it shoots past your short strike, the delta on your long strike is so big that it can gain more than the short strike loses. As long as you close the whole position before the short gets too far in the money, you're still good.You would never ever want to exercise the long side, that's just throwing away the extrinsic you paid for.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 08:10:32'] Cup and handle!! If it bounces off the 200 dMA it will explode to the upside.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-27 16:26:08'] just make sure that the calls youre selling have at least a 0.5 delta less than the delta of your long call. also be careful selling weeklies if that’s your thing

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-28 18:43:35'] I think you do good if you do it that way. We know FAANG is not going anywhere anytime soon. The reason people buy option is because they can’t afford to buy the stock, since the stock is expensive. But with options you can’t benefit from stock splits and writing covered call. But you can write covered options as some mentioned by doing spreads off of your long position and make money. Most broker will allow you that, but it may depend on your level of option to do that and type of broker you have I know you can do it with fidelity. I have 1 google long contract. It is deep in money but still cost me 28K. You can imagine how much 100 google stocks cost you. The only disadvantage from long options are if you buy them short term even 6 months. It should be your long investment. Just throw it there and watch it grow. I prefer I guess don’t do IDM, better do it OTM, since you know AAPL goes up, you know in one to two years it get at least $170-$200. I am sure it will get to this price, 2023. As one of the participant mentioned you don’t want your stock to be exercised in two or three months. Although you can roll if up and out if its price increase and pocket the profit. If I am very conservative my estimate will be $220 until April 2024. Then why I should be for high premium for $120? I buy it cheaper and longer expiration. This in only way I do naked call for stocks, even apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-28 18:57:19'] I am not sure if you have margine? What I did was surprising and only learned it after I did. I bought $100 Tesla, overnight I had a house call. Either I had to sell my Tesla or possibly my broker was doing it. My house call was 12K I sold a covered call for Tesla for 2023 for 14,500. It brought me out of my house call. I will keep my Tesla. even at the 8% margine interest rate. Since I can make money weekly from premium, my TSLA is still there. I hope it split one day and I have more TSLA. But I am planning to sell weekly covered call and generate premium income.  APPL’s covered call premium is not as high as other stocks like TESLA, RIOT, BLOK. It depends on your strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-28 05:47:03'] I am expecting apple, at some point this year, to break below $100. I am thinking something like the 2008-2016 stagflation issues ahead for the US market.

I’ve lowered cost average significantly, but still disappointed at my poor analysis. Most likely Monday I’ll double down and ride off of 5G news and earnings. It is extremely unlikely these will roll ITM much less pull a profit, but at least I might be able to recover some losses.Edit: I also do believe the tech sector has reached its peak suffering. With Black Friday and then the holidays coming up, consumers will want to get their devices.

And it’s free, so, no subscription required.  Not advice either, just info on flows and trends with full YouTube run downs on the weekend.  No,I’m not affiliated with it.  This was a classic blow off top.  The question is not if it can fall further, it’s what is the Fedusry and Congress going to allow.  Since Congress is tied up with the SC nomination, I would expect a CR through the election and then real deal pending the outcome.  That could delay stimulus.  If Wall Street doesn’t want to play that game they will gap this shit down and force the action — remember every airline is laying off thousands next week without “stimulus.”  If the market tanks next week, possible the Fed puts out a fax like in June saying they are going to buy total market MFs.  They are a little trapped though: action all benefits the banks and funds that front run this shit.  So, be careful here.  Could go up, but until we make new higher low, the trend is a slow bleed down to regain price discovery.  We are oversold to be sure, but historically, valuations are still wildly too high.  At some point it’ll matter.  Global economy sucks and getting worse.

Two years out for AAPL...sentiment is even for two years? Is the market telling us that this will be flat for two years?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 05:30:23'] Those calls are deep **in-the-money** (ITM), so *time value is expected to be low*.Time value is always highest at-the-money (ATM). The Mar ‘23 ATM contract has about $20 of time value and is a better indicator of projected growth and volatility. Deep ITM options can be used as an alternate to buying the stock outright and will generally be priced (fairly) in that context. For example, instead of spending $127 (Friday’s closing price) to buy $AAPL outright, an investor could spend $55.25 (the offer) on the deep ITM option, $52 of which is intrinsic value ($75 strike + $52 intrinsic value = $127 current price) and only $3.25 of which is time value. That’s like buying $AAPL at $127 using $52 of margin for 2 years for $3.25 in interest payments (about 3.2% interest). All in all, I don’t think you should interpret the deep ITM option price as a projection of future value. That’s just not how option pricing works. Let new know if you have questions.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 04:43:39'] This is a high delta call with very low IV. So it is pretty much like stock at this moment and will move like stock. This is not technically a call that will predict what the market is expecting. People buying and/or pricing this call are looking at it as a pure stock substitute.Probably when you bought it in Jan the IV was much higher and/or the stock price was much higher. But usually for high delta calls the extrinsic is quite low since most of the value is intrinsic.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 10:28:52'] With deep ITM call options, you can treat them as synthetic shares. Options contracts control 100 shares. A .7 delta LEAPS at expiry will equal the current share price. So basically if the stock trades sideways for literally the entire time, it breaks even. These options are almost certainly a hedge for shorts, or someone looking to leverage AAPL for whatever strategy. I buy deep ITM LEAPS because I cannot afford 100 shares, but still want to gain as if I was owning 100 shares. I profit, sell the contract, whatever gains I make I buy shares and buy a new options if my outlook remains the same for the underlying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 16:29:59'] Looks like AAPL doubled in 2020. Is Apple really twice as valuable in 2021 as it was in 2019? Or did something else happen, less shares? Sorry I don’t track AAPL.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-07 22:04:45'] For the next few weeks, macro econ conditions are much more important than individual stocks being overbought/oversold. Even if AAPL is oversold, a little bump up in treasury yields will spook the Nasdaq again. Buy short-term calls on tech at your own risk.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-07 23:19:24'] I say wait a moment while markets correct themselves. The direction indicates a downtrend so expecting a rise to or near $140 is a bit of stretch solely because AAPL is a slow mover.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-07 23:37:37'] AAPL is the best run company in the world, earns more than some countries.  That said the April $140 call selling for .87, has a delta of .12, so the street doesn’t think there’s much possible in that option, but if Apple announces a new product rollout then you could make some $.  Let’s face it, the cost is only $87 per option, so the risk is low.   I’m generally a bull on Apple, but the street often undervalues it compared to the overall market.  That said, it is at a 32 multiple which is high historically.  Lots to consider.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 04:11:10'] I honestly don't understand the tech rout.  Apple, Microsoft, and everyone else had an amazing earnings season sending the stocks to new highs and then they have tanked since then.And the government is printing a bunch of money to send out to everyone.  If you don't have a job, it's going to help you keep food on the table, but if you do have a job, you're going to buy an iPhone (or Gamestop stock).  Apple has boosted production of the iPhone because, well, people are spending their stimulus checks on toys.I have doubts that AAPL would hit $140 by April 16, but certainly it's going to get back there this year.

On top of that he doesn't state his DTE and making 11x on a $7 move has got to be deep OTM. Primarily because it moved slowly upward; the largest movement was actually on 8/14 between high and the previous day low. TL;DR: The shit is fake, paper-traded or pointlessly risky.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 17:24:21'] OTM options are expensive and more of a gamble than an investment. If I were you I'd be looking at ITM or deep ITM calls if you can afford it. Higher initial cost but much better  probability of success and lower breakeven.The AAPL March 137.5 has 4.90 of extrinsic value so break even is 142.4 and only 38% probability of being in the money at expirationIf you buy a March 120 call it's 15.75 yes a lot more but there is only 1.70 in Extrinsic so your BE is only 135.70 with a 80% probability of being in the money at expiration

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 13:55:27'] Higher liquidity will eventually flow into post-split AAPL options, since a stock split is usually done to attract more retail activity. HOWEVER....... in the meantime current option contracts will be adjusted by the OCC (effective as of the day of the split) and the liquidity THERE will be horrible.Knowing this, it is better if you bail out of current option positions in AAPL because liquidity will dry up once new post-split options are available.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 14:02:10'] What you described will encourage people who could not afford before to be able to acquire more shares to rise the stock price. With fractional share ownership I suspect it will slow down the process.  As for option I think you need to increase contracts accordingly which I agree is harder with a lower price.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 22:21:01'] What happens to the Option:“What Is a Stock Split?"Being made whole" means the options contract is modified so that the holder is neither negatively nor positively affected by the corporate action. While a stock split adjusts the price of an option's underlying security, the contract is adjusted so that any changes in price due to the split do not affect the value of the option. If your option is purchased post-split (that is, after the split is announced), it will not be adjusted because it already reflects the post-split price of the underlying security.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 09:39:16'] Personal choice. IME, whenever I let an option trade ride for extra juice (even with plenty of time till expiry), the mkts seem to ALWAYS figure out a way to behave in such a way that I end up never getting more juice and selling for less profit. Nowadays, when a long call/put trade jumps much futher and faster than expected, I take the profits without a second thought. Then I sit in duck blind waiting for another entry on the same trade idea. Sometimes it just keeps repeating. I've been trading JMIA $30 Nov calls for a month or 2. Buy the dip, sell the rip, rinse repeat. Stock oscillated between 27-31 for a while and I made a lot of money with zero stress. Pattern just broke down last week. I'll prob sell CSPs on the reversal (whenever that is) and also load calls. I'll prob bump expiry into Dec/Jan. I hate playing these trades with tight DTE.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 08:15:51'] I agree with the others.  Taking the profit now is never a bad idea.  I guess the total depends on how much you believe the stock will weaken.  The other impact you have to consider is the income tax implications, unless these are in an ira

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 21:36:15'] IF you want to retain your position but also take some profits & (sometimes) can afford to tie up some equity safely, simply sell a higher call same EXP. If there is a Drop in price or even IV you can buy the call you sold back releasing your equity, I would check the IV first to see if where it sits based on historical values. Equity part is not always required, depends on broker etc. only shitty ones will make you tie equity up because it was not originally executed as a spread. Bad scenario, it keeps mooning & you positioned yourself on capping your max return, Worst case scenario APPL drops decreasing the values of your call & the one you sold drastically, but you can buy the one you sold back & also release your equity & then AAPL doesnt move high enough to gain back the lost value of your call if not more & expires worthless. No right or wrong here, unless you are a fortune teller & still make the wrong decision. Manage your risks but consider ever scenario, profit is profit in the end.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 16:42:49'] Whilst these companies are all solid growth companies,  and leaps have a high probability of success in their intrinsic value, the iv/time value is super high which is the premium you lose as time passes.   You need to carefully review the breakeven stock price and consider how little the excess value in the end might be.If you're trying to own the company,  short puts can be a better approach.  Or,  a covered call diagonal spread.  If you go with a diagonal,  you'll need to go with a stock with a lower volatility since it decreases the chances you'll be assigned in the short call. If you're just trying to speculate on the long call,  leaps are good when you think a stock has bottomed after a bunch of bad news/ disappointment.   Otherwise,  a steady growth stock is best to speculate on short term price changes with quarterly earnings announcements.   Imo, not advice!They're all going to the moon...in timeMade a small edit regarding volatility To clarify,  a high iv means the stock moves a lot more,  and more likely to be assigned.  A low iv means a lower chance of assignment.

POST_TEXT: b'Not too deep into options just yet, but Curious what you guys thought about Apples upcoming earnings report on the 27th in regards to buying options pretty close in expiration to it, like Feb 5th. Word is that theyre expected to have a pretty good report this quarter, higher than expected and a lot of upgrades/holding a buy rating. \n\nIf this is actually a plausible good play I was thinking somewhere in the lines of a Jan 29th or feb 5th ~150 call or so would be pretty low risk high reward since its been steadily rising and is only about $10 OTM.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 20:26:57'] It's a coin flip, and honestly more like 1/3 since you're so directional.  There are a variety of reasons why a good earnings may cause the stock to go down, so keep that in mind.  If everyone is thinking like this, the report could be priced in.  Steady rising stock may indicate this.&#x200B;Short dated long options on earnings plays will suffer greatly from IV crush, so you have to be really correct, not just correct.  This is especially so for deep OTM.&#x200B;Low risk / High reward is pretty subjective.  Nominally you might not be paying much, but there is a big chance you lose a ton of the capital in one day.&#x200B;Could be a home run, you could strike out.  No one really knows the result, but it is incredibly likely you'll lose a ton of extrinsic value either way.&#x200B;Also, there are a ton of posts like these so please use the search function.  You can also post in the noob safe haven thread if you don't want to be flamed in the comments, just a heads up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 20:27:29'] Try selling put spreads instead of buying calls. IV will be very high in front of earnings. Selling put spreads is a nice way to get long by selling a decaying asset. With calls if you are wrong you will likely lose after earnings unless it explode to the upside. Understand implied volatility, especially if you plan on buying calls in front of earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 21:51:08'] I have a $130 call. Here's my opinion on why I'm holding for at least the day before earnings and possibly through earnings. 1) Netflix recently exploded after earnings so it is possible 2) Predicted 100b+ earnings this quarter, highest ever. People upgraded their phones/setups to accommodate working from home etc., holiday season, and you could even take into account those $600 stimulus checks to going to upgrading laptops etc. 3) Apple is basically a blue chip stock and has not slowed down nor seems to be losing steam. I say Apple calls are always good and worst case scenario it goes down temporarily, but it will correct and keep going up.  Don't buy 150 for a 2/5 exp tho, thats far too out of the money and close to exp. If it doesn't depreciate by then it might get a few bucks. I'm amateur tho, just my opinion!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 21:09:10'] I'd not short AAPL through earnings. Normally I would sell the IC, but in AAPL's case, they've been beating the estimates like a drum. Two scenarios for me.1) sell the put spread to take advantage of IV crush.2) play AAPL after earnings. Lets say you sell an OTM call spread with a .20 delta, and AAPL beats estimates, there's a very good chance they will, you could get screwed if it goes ITM.I was thinking about selling a weeklies OTM call spreads on NFLX before the close for earnings, luckily I didn't. I'd have been fucked so hard that won't be able to sit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 01:58:03'] Buy Feb 19 130 strike and hold it until just before earning.   If your super confident of the big results your deep in the money so your call should hold up well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-22 08:55:45'] You are thinking about this wrong. $10 OTM is different for a $25 stock, a $100 stock, and say Amazon. Look at the percent it has to go up vs what you have to pay, in percent of the share price. Or buy blindly the choice is yours!
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 20:58:36'] Earnings are a crap shoot and AAPL is a slow mover. I would not expect it to suddenly jump almost 15% in 1 week
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-21 23:46:22'] Look at apples behavior for the past 3 weeks, the stock just kept selling off again and again. Bears were unable to get make it go below 126 - look at the triple bottom at the chart. The technicals with the positive expectation of the earning will make apple go higher. The best play would be to wait for a pullback Friday and buy call debit spreads that might go in the money.

When I was new I had calls on Disney, and was betting on a good earnings report to cause a jump in price. They beat the expected earnings and had way more subscribers on Disney+ than expected. And then the stock price went down in after hours trading and I got burned. Sometimes the people will sell off to lock in profits after earnings. Sometimes the price of shares and especially options is inflated by positive expectations of good earnings and a lot of that fades away after the actual numbers are known. Just something to think about when you're deciding how much to spend on call options.

I gave my canned stock split pitch about how the value of the company is the same before and after the split, that you own the same (tiny) percentage of shares, etc. If one is buying as an investment, then it doesn't really matter when you buy. An investor should generally put his or her money to work as soon as possible and then wait. If you want to minimize potential regret, one can divide their capital into equal pieces and buy on a fixed schedule (25% on the first of the next 4 months, for example).\n\nBack to AAPL - in case you missed it (and if you're reading this, you haven't), since they announced on the stock split on the 30th, AAPL shot up leading into the split.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 14:57:02'] In the absolute short term, there is seemingly bound to be a red day coming. AAPL otherwise is seemingly settling into a new trading range. Hard to know whether that is going to be 135-145, 140-150, 145-155, or 150-160. If we see 155 and above 160, that will be a real big surprise and would seemingly be certainly overbought at that point.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-16 06:55:50'] Even if your short call is ITM you should be able to roll for a credit,  Or you could pay more to roll and raise your strike. Your debit will be less that your strike increase, so no loss there.The only thing I can think of that can result in debit roll is if the short positions is too deep ITM and there are no volume for that strike.I think if your share your trade, it can make things much clear.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-12 10:45:23'] Selling a CSP for Jan 21' at 122.50 would give a you a far better break even if your goal is to be assigned (around 111)? And if you don't get assigned then you've made some money. I personally don't see any point in going so far ITM, too many things that can wrong for so little reward.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-12 12:44:52'] Please, Correct me if I’m wrong...Selling the ITM put will lower your cost, but NOT lower your actual APPL cost basis. This term is used a lot here (r/options) and, while my point is petty, I don’t think it’s the correct use of “cost basis”.  We should consider our trades separately for both trade review AND taxes. IF you are assigned for the $150 put, your cost basis will be $150. You will simply have made some money from selling the put option initially. These are two separate trades that, while connected, are separate. The IRS is only interested in your actual purchase price for the stock ($150). Hold it long term, and you’ll use that number to calculate your future long term capital gains. Hold APPL short term, and the profit from selling the stock later will be taxed the same as your profit from selling the put.*** Edit: correction/clarification posted below by Sweetleef - per IRS, you should deduct or add premium to the executed strike price to adjust cost basis and doing so does not effect the short vs. long term status of the capital gain or loss.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-12 10:46:56'] If you want to hedge slightly against the stock tanking, you could make it a put spread, its wideness being equal to how much you'd be willing to let the price fall before dumping the shares that you "already have" if/when they tank.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-12 12:49:25'] I don't see the value of selling deep ITM puts.  Can someone explain?  The deeper you go ITM, the less extrinsic value you are selling.  So you are assuming all the downside risk (and I guess reaping the upside benefit) of owning 100 shares.  Is it that your initial capital outlay is small (you collect PUT premium and tie up just a small amount of buying power) for immediate exposure to the underlying?  Appreciate any explanation, as this is a strategy I have not really considered.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-12 16:08:46'] No one has mentioned this so someone correct me if I'm wrong. If you sell something that deep ITM, you are at risk of getting assigned early. If you are also somehow selling calls, you'd have to make sure that your strike price is $150 and above so you don't end up being assigned at the same time.  Also, would your broker allow you to sell naked calls, since you're not officially covered if you're just holding puts?

You miss out on upside with Ccs, and make less overall than if you'd just held. It could be more of an ITM LEAP candidate, as you can get cheap contracts with high delta, and it will cost you a lot less capital than selling CCs or CSPs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-26 21:31:30'] Premium is too low. AAPL IV is around 15. You could do it but I think wheeling stock with IV of 30 if you are more convervative or IV of 50 if you want to be a bit more risky. IV of 100 seems too high for me.Edit: Selling a put of APPL at strike on 132 has premium of 0.78. Thats about 0.5%. Selling a put of DKNG (IV of 40-50) strike of $51 has a premium of 0.93. Thats close to 2%. Or if you want to be closer to market price at strike of $51.50, the premium is 1.09.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-27 12:06:10'] LEAPS or owning  stocks outright is the best strategy for AAPL. Selling premium on AAPL? No&#x200B;Look at stocks like SNAP, RBLX or PENN if you want to run the wheel.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-27 07:38:12'] Check out MOXC for a wheel strategy. ATM Premiums are close to 25% of the value of 100x shares. IV is around 268%

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 21:34:59'] Personally, I don't see the point in buying a stock just to sell covered calls against it. I usually reserve selling calls against a position after it has run up alot and I wouldn't mind locking in gains. Like someone previously suggested, if you want to collect premium, just sell puts on aapl until you get exercised.

I sold on Tuesday and my account is now just north of $40,000. \n\nIve been doing some research and Im super long on Apple. I legitimately think it will crawl back up to the pre-split price of around $400 by mid to late 2022. Yes I understand that it might be crazy to think that Apple will have over a 4 trillion dollar market cap in less than 2 years but Im still a believer. \n\nRight now Im thinking of getting a bunch of calls that expire in June but I am just not sure what strike I should buy. Im leaning towards way OTM i.e. 200-250 but I am also holding back because I dont know the costs and benefits of weighing those extremely OTM calls vs ITM calls. \n\nI guess my question is, if you knew the price of Apple was going to be at least $300 by June 2022, what strike and date would you buy?\n\nThanks in advance for the feedback :)'
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 01:58:50'] If you think that AAPL is gonna go up 100%+ in two years then I would suggest buying some dirt cheap ass LEAPS for 2023. Dirt cheap probably being a hundred dollars per contract but if you buy enough and it does grow that much, well, you can probably retire by the time they get set to expire. And I'm talking as OTM as you can get. Worse case scenario you can write off some of the losses. Best case scenario you are rich as fuck.Edit: Just checked the price on AAPL LEAPS, longest out with highest strike is Mar172023 200 for a cool $1000 a pop, so I was really fucking off, but still honestly not that expensive.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 12:04:11'] Thing is we don't and can't know Apples price.  Nothing wrong w/ following your research and/or gut, but Diversification is the Only Free Lunch.  Do enough Do or Die options and the odds will catch up with you and you'll have nothing.  So diversify and don't bet it all on one stock or worse one option.  Cause options often end at Zero. Beginners win, win win, win, then lose it all.  Not even due to a black swan, just a gray one.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 06:48:01'] Sell Puts to finance your dream. I would not do this, as it would introduce huge risk on top of the chance you’ll lose all the premium for the way OTM calls you want to buy, but... I’m not “a believer” who would want to risk a lot on the doubling of AAPL either. Good luck to you.  Be careful.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 12:33:09'] This is not necessarily what strike I would buy, but just for fun, I took the data for all the AAPL June 17, 2022 (expiry) options that traded yesterday, and put it in a spreadsheet. Using AAPL closing price of $127.14 and assuming AAPL is exactly $300 on June 17, 2022 (the price and date you mentioned above), the option that gets you the best return is the $225 Call.  Bid / Ask is 3.60 to 3.85    If you can get it for around $3.75 your return would be just over 1,900% when it is worth at least $75 near expiry. Other options from $170 to $250 all would return more than 1,200% based on yesterday’s closing option prices (using the midpoint). Of course, AAPL would have to hit $300! That’s the hard part.  Just some fun with math. Good luck with whatever you choose.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 17:59:10'] I’ve been getting killed with my AAPL calls since December. It’s getting ridiculous actually and about to give up on them all together.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 18:02:54'] I honestly think the leveraged covered call is the way to go. You'll make allot more than being in the stock outright and allot less capital. Don't go further than a year out. You'll lose the ability maneuver if you go to far. I tend to look for just over a year so that if I want to I have the ability to take profits at reduced tax in a taxable account. DiagonalBuy a .90 delta call year out. Sell a .55 delta call 21 to 24 days out. Roll the the short call before it expires, if underwater in it you'll just roll it to more premium. You'll way outperform the stock with this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 21:04:43'] There is some simple math you can do and I do it all the time because it’s my strategy. Strike plus premium paid = your break even price (on expiration).  So aapl 200s are 10.4, 3/2023 exp. that is a break even if 210.4, so anything over that is gravy. Now... if you want a 100% gain Apple would have to go to 420.8. If it’s going to go on a massive run like that it may be more but we’re just playing the numbers here. To do this though you need a price target by a date, which you have.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-17 04:10:40'] Tastytrade did an awesome study on buying options and even with correctly picking outlier moves resulted in losses overall. I personally always short premium. But to each their own
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-17 15:20:52'] Here's one way to play it...Decide what you think the stock price might be 1 year from now. Open a calendar spread at that strike, buying the AAPL Jan 2023 and selling the Jan 2022 against it.The premium collected from the short leg reduces your cost.The risk chart should show quite a wide price range that would be profitable one year from now.I've actually done this on XLK a few months ago, when the 2023 leaps became available.

The premiums are pretty high though
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-18 15:03:21'] 1. What time frame does LEAP mean for you? 12. MSFT and AAPL and not the same thing as AMD. Much larger companies \~2 TRILLION dollars, while AMD is \~100 Billion. Also MSFT and AAPL have dividend payments admittedly nothing earthshattering.3. Do you intend on using the LEAPs for something other than just leverage? as in are you just buying leaps instead of share to multiply delta?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-18 20:36:15'] The answer is PYPL. AAPL & MSFT are great, but already huge. AMD is good too, but valued as a growth company (subject to the  heavy swings). PYPL is your slow and steady bet. LEAPS are almost guaranteed money.

Looking at the 3-month running options prices via the link below you can track how the performance of your options have been doing over a specific period of time. I think the max you can set it is 90 days, but if you max the time period out you should be able to see what you’re option was selling for a few months ago and that may give you some more peace of mind or indsight.If I were you, I may consider holding cuz your call doesn’t expire for another couple months, but then again if you have reason to believe the market (and AAPL) will keep going down the put in a stop-loss order, and get out and buy back in when you think the worst has passed.https://www.optionistics.com/quotes/option-prices

If you really want to sells calls against an ITM call you need to be going way further out and preferably more ITM. I would close this position(well never would have had it to begin with) and open a new LEAPS at the 1/2022 exp or later.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 13:43:33'] Thanks for this.I always like to say that I consider my role as a moderator to be enforcing the subreddit rules and promoting good discourse, not necessarily to be a sage who knows everything about options and is always right.>"Margin loans are driven by the flow of cash. If cash flows out of the account and goes to zero, that's when a margin loan comes into play. In a short options trade, there is no money flowing out of the account. Cash might be put on hold for the collateral, but you aren't spending down your cash balance. In fact, it ought to go up from the credit you received on the short."This is something I've long suspected and have wanted to clarify for a while.  It's a major shortcoming in how introductory articles explain something (which we see in options-related topics all the time.)  Articles on what margin is and how it works tend to make it sound like you can *choose* to take out a margin loan anytime you want, as though if you have $50k cash, and want to buy 1000 shares of a stock that's at 50, instead of paying all cash, you can tick some sort of "buy on margin" box on the order page, and pay only $25k cash, and take out a margin loan for the other $25k.  But this isn't true.  Instead, as you buy stuff, you keep spending cash, and when you've used up all your cash, if you keep buying stuff, then you automatically take out a margin loan.  And then as you sell stuff, the proceeds keep paying down your margin loan, and once your margin loan balance is zero, then if you keep selling stuff, you start to have a cash balance again.At least I think that's right.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 19:13:43'] My advice, Put a candlestick, Look for built upto volatility for 2-3 period on a monthly chart. Close your position. Yes, Please do not make it a hoops trade . If on monthly basis it’s breaking above 1 sigma consider closing your position.  Take a pause here and behave like a leopard I.e let the trade come to you. Now consider taking a meditative approach. Once again on the monthly chart look forRelative strength to breakdown below 20 or support to fall below 2sigma. Once again put a candlestick chart and look for candles to fall down at 2-3 periods. This is where you initiate trade far out may be like a leap contract expiring in Jan 21 2022 ITM or 2-3 strike or move to a strike thats more liquids and spreads are tight and initiate a trade.Keep an eye on the trade and tighten your stop losses for few periods. If everything looks good. Let it fly. And once again when it picks up, follow the same pattern and close the trade.Repeat the process, once the principal is recovered consider making the next trade as an actual leap trade to avoid short term taxation following the similar pattern. Most importantly keep an eye on vix on cboe website more than looking at SPY puts. You’ll figure out a correlation and might start to evolve and explore. Good luck and don’t loose hope but try existing out of hope trades. Liquidity is the fuel of the options market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 14:09:48'] Just got crushed recently by IV -  I’d encourage against it. If you want to roll the dice do it on a portion instead of the entire position.Nothing wrong with taking profits. Redeploy the capital after earnings/crush and keep rolling
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 15:28:42'] For what it’s worth, IV crush is less of a factor the farther out your expiration date is. Longer dated contracts and LEAPS might fluctuate a little bit from a post earnings IV crush but not in a devastating way like if you bought Apr 30th FDs. Edit: I’m a dumbass I just read you have may 21st contracts. Godspeed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 19:01:20'] I nearly always play AAPl earnings.It's pretty simple really. AAPL usually, although not always, has a pretty strong reponse to earnings, sometimes huge. If your bet is directionally correct, you will make a very decent profit. If wrong, you may lose most of your position, but it may recover given that you have a 21 May.Most of this talk about IV collapse is mostly nonsense. A May 21 expiry will suffer a small amount, but not much. And that only if the stock doesn't away from the pre-earnings close.Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-29 14:41:09'] Here are my predictions for what it is worth. I am prepared to be wrong and I appreciate OPs post!AAPL - Probably lower than expected revenues. Their stores were closed so that really hurts them and they were closed for a good chunk of the quarter. Furthermore, I read somewhere that when they opened stores, a majority of the customers were not there for new purchases, but for repairs. Their products are expensive and unemployment can't be good for their premium product sales (iphones, laptops, etc.). Big pull back after down into the $350s/$360s.Last note I forgot - hence the edit: The iphone announcement will be HUGE. I read some rumors that they are looking to Q4 now and NOT a September release for the new phone. 49.7% if Apple's revenue comes from Iphone sales!  If they are still pushing for September, all quarterly sales news, good or bad will not even matter. $400+ here we come!AMZN - Amazing revenues.... like insane revenues from both goods and AWS. But lower earnings due to added COVID measures. Small 3-5% pull back into the $2800s, maybe even a bit into the $2700s. AWS is my watch here. MSFT's Azure really crushed it last week. Either they are eating into AWS OR remote work will propel them. The earnings bar is set really high for them so I worry that even as well as they do, they still might disappoint.GOOGL/FB - Who friggin' knows. I can't imagine companies are spending a ton of marketing dollars AND laying people off. That doesn't make sense.NASDAQ/Tech Bubble - There is a retraction UNTIL the new stimulus is passed. And then things pop back up to where they are now. OR until good COVID news is generated (good vaccine, numbers going down, etc.)&#x200B;TL;DR - Fu\*k tomorrow is a really big and frankly scary day. Right now I am leaning more towards a red AH and Friday :( Hope I am wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 03:24:14'] Thanks for the work on the post. Would be interest in other peoples thoughts but here are mineAMZN - I'm thinking due to the various COVID-19 travel restrictions, AMZN had to deal with distribution issues (i.e. rerouting trucks, extra expense with moving inventory), AWS probably killed it, but this will be continually off set by the expense associated with COVID 19 in warehouses.I'm expecting a drop.APPL - I agree with someone that posted earlier, purchases of new phones and devices were slowed by shut downs, and I read somewhere that cook announced subscriptions on news app was down. I anticipate people trimmed their subscriptions, so reoccurring rev. will be downFB - Who knows, when I log in I always see these "stock Gurus" pumping their programs. I anticipate that advertisers are going to move to that vs TV especially given sports are just coming backGoogle - Similar thoughts with facebook, but everyone in states with high covid 19 had to move to online advertising, and also I think their cloud infrastructure is growing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 07:47:46'] The 140 strike is a good choice, but I would have picked the July 16 expiration. There's way more volume and open interest for the monthly expiration. If you have a choice between a weekly and a monthly (when the expirations are close), pick the monthly.  But either way, I like the strike.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 10:30:11'] > Should i move my calls out past earnings To play a gap up?  volatility crush can kill the premiums and quite possibly override delta/gamma, decoupling premium from price after earnings and causing a premium gap down despite a price gap up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 08:24:29'] I'm playing the opposite, only cause I need to rebalance out of Apple a little, so I sold calls hoping for some shares to get taken away. I've usually played Apple this way and came out the other end pretty positive. 99% of the time, I feel Apple's earning play are in the run up to date. When they have another record breaking quarter, the sell off happens and the floor isn't quite as low. Rinse, repeat, raising Apple's floor each time. $140 seems to be a good strike, it toed the lines in AH last earnings and the in January's earnings, the run up hit a high of $145. It's a 7% run up from their 50-day SMA and their 50-day EMA. Good luck!

POST_TEXT: b'Hi looking for advice here. I sold a 140/135 Apple spread in late august that will expire in mid October (around 45 dte).\n\n\nApple has breached the support of 142 twice now and Im getting worried that it will not recover by 15 October.\n\n\nWhat is your advice for me? Roll it? Close it? Or just hold till Oct 15?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 06:42:03'] Please put the expiration in your title for future posts,.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-30 17:35:33'] If it makes sense from a credit/debit perspective, roll it and possibly lower the strikes.  Or, if you have the funds for the short leg, you could sell the long leg when you think it’s gained the most, get assigned on the short leg and start selling calls against the assigned shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-30 17:32:39'] First sign of profit, close it - otherwise wait unless it breaks the dance floor at 143 imo.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-30 21:28:09'] Since it is still OTM, you should be still able to roll to later expirations for credit. If you’re breaking even or profit and no longer want to play, close it. No need to wait till 10/15. Put the cash aside and waiting for a better entry point or other trades.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 13:41:12'] Just because you’re selling and just because that’s decay is exponential doesn’t mean you have to hold it to expiration for that 100% gain. Yeah it inherently feels bad but you have to treat it like any other option. If you hit like 70% profit just take it, no matter how many DTE are left.

POST_TEXT: b'Everywhere here I see people predicting new ATH for $AAPL based on the stocks previous spike before their last earnings announcement, which would indicate massive potential profit for short calls in the next 2 weeks before their next earnings call on the 28th. However, looking at the stocks history around earnings going back a year, the stock price looks to go DOWN in the week or two leading up to earnings and RISE shortly following. Why would this time be any different? It seems the safest bet would be to wait and buy calls AFTER earnings after the IV crush, and since the stock price fell today, buying short calls in anticipation for earnings soon would be risky and long calls before earnings would risk Vega damage from IV fluctuations following earnings.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-12 20:29:25'] I don’t know what history you looked at, but their last earnings they got up to over $145 before they reported. Then they dipped down after earnings, and are now recovering again going into this earnings. I could see AAPL exceeding that $145 going into this earnings, and maybe staying up or going up more after this earnings.

If the stock goes lateral, "premium" (hehe). If the stock goes down, you lost same as if u were holding 100 shares, and if the stock goes deep in the mud, you only loss your 5,500$ but still having 10,000$ to buy more shares at a discount :)\n\nWhat do you think about this?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 18:28:09'] This what Nicholas Taleb suggested in The Black Swan.  Probably has more merit these days with current interest rates.Without selling the call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 20:28:22'] Solid idea that should return decent but not spectacular returns most of the time. There are going to be years, such as last year, where both bonds and stocks go down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 10:30:08'] Understand that to some degree, the money that you make in t bills is offset by the premium.  Carry cost is priced into options, incesing call premium relative to the put.  Higher interest rates means that you pay more for the call, though to a lesser degree if high delta.    The big advantage of a deep ITM LEAP is reduced risk to the downside. Another is the ability to adjust the position.  For example, roll the call up if the underlying gains, booking gains and reducing risk (at the cost of maximum profit).    [This might be of interest to you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qf054i/deep_itm_leap_vs_shares/hhxacjt/)

And that's basically where I get lost lol. The table shows 40% interest from buying these calls but I don't get that - you are shelling out thousands of dollars to buy these calls, so what exactly are you earning interest on?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 10:25:30'] Worth a review but I’m digging
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 11:37:35'] Sorry, I'm triggered by "LEAP" without qualifying put or call.LEAP is not the singular of LEAPS. LEAPS is an acronym, you always use all five letters and the S stands for Securities. You form the singular and plural with the noun being qualified, so one LEAPS call, two LEAPS calls.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-10 20:49:41'] Take one of the table collect your earnings and leave the other to see where it goes. The split shouldn't do all that much in price action.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-10 20:56:36'] Fundamentally nothing will change on the split.  However this has been a weird year for stocks and after the split, shares will become more accessible to people (myself included).  Given how strong FOMO is in the Robinhood and New Investor crowd, this could create a sudden flurry of buying activity, resulting in a short term price spike.  As easily as this could happen, though, it could just as easily not happen.  That’s the thing with options, they’re often more of a gamble than the equity itself.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-10 20:35:44'] Nothing will change after the split if you're still bullish

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 09:49:00'] So you would have time to react on Friday morning. Most probably you wouldnt be able able to excercise the shares until closing session on Friday and only if you close in the money. However, if by Friday you do not have enough funds to buy the shares and they are in the money, then the broker most probably will sell your call options between noon and one hour before close at market prices.Also as a side note, playing a stock through its earnings is a complete gamble. Its more reliable to play the runup to the event from a couple of weeks earlier. Especially considering that bigtech stocks are at all time highs and many have the beating expectations priced in, so even if they beat theres still a real possibility that they go down, as was the case with MSFT or NOW in the last days for example. Also consider that there is a portion of the options premium, Implied Volatility (IV) that gets eroded quickly after catalyst events such as earnings.Hope this helps
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 07:58:27'] You’ll get IV crushed
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 08:37:29'] You could sell a call above the price you paid to create a spread. This will protect you from some theta and IV crush tomorrow if it doesn’t go up. That way you don’t lose everything you put in.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 08:02:42'] You can exercise tomorrow morning if you want, but wait until the end of the day.If they dip under $400, then exercising at $400 would have lost you money.Edit: I misread. Depends on your broker, they usually prefer if you sell before noon if you are not planning on possible assignment.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 08:32:46'] if you can sell them for a profit today I would just take my money.  I don't know if AAPL is going to crush earnings as much because their new phones have been delayed because of covid.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 12:48:29'] I’d say reduce your position and take the profits now (though small). The IV crush and poor economic data sets up a situation where even if they have strong earnings, it’s priced in.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 15:15:57'] To see the estimates you're looking for, first make a calculation with the current option price (e.g. $4.50) – this sets the current IV for the option.  After you've made the calculation once and have seen the chart, update the option price to what you paid for it.Here's one I prepared earlier ;) [http://opcalc.com/dOr](http://opcalc.com/dOr)What was happening is it was trying to calculate the IV if the option was worth $7.65 now, with AAPL's share price at $120.90, which isn't the case.  (I'll change how this works in the new version as I know it's not intuitive.)There's a full write up on this here, [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/blog/entering-an-open-options-trade-as-a-new-calculation](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/blog/entering-an-open-options-trade-as-a-new-calculation)

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 13:32:21'] Your calculations are right. Probably when you bought the call, AAPL was in uptrend all nice and fine. Now that after it has gone down suddenly, probably IV has increased so option premiums have increased hence break-even at lower stock price. This also mean that you may actually not break-even when you reach the price of $126-127 if IV goes down by then.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 13:36:34'] You break even when the options contract reaches $7.65. The value of the S&P 500 isn’t that relevant, if that’s what you mean by SP. Otherwise, if you mean strike price, you that is always going to be $160 and someone has provided you misinformation...There’s no closed form solution as value of contract will heavily depend on volatility of AAPL (which will likely decline negatively affecting value of your options...) Assuming fairly constant volatility (or assuming you try to hedge volatility with VIX puts), break even on 9/30 at around $136, 10/30 around 142 and 11/30 around 150.40. At expiry, you break even at around $167. However, like I said, heavily dependent on volatility.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 14:31:12'] Covered call strategies seem to be getting more popular recently from what I see. Personally, I don’t like them in this market. Everything is flying right now far beyond fundamentals. Selling covered calls closes yourself off to upside gains and leaves you open to unlimited downside risk. I believe the market has some time before a real correction starts, but once it does selling covered calls will be a terrible strategy. It’s only really a good strategy when markets are flat.Be careful and make sure you deploy the right strategy for current market conditions.If you want to learn more about my strategies and thought in the market follow my free blog.https://relativestrengthpro.com/posts/

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:13:03'] It's going to take you $600+ to buy it, but your max profit is going to be pretty low in comparison. Should be the width of the spread - the debit. So I guess risk 1 to possibly make 1.2 or something like that. Might be a good strat for some people, but im more into shorter term options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:57:31'] I used to be an MFO subscriber years ago. Are you sure you have the options dates and types correct? I've seen 2 types of strategies at MFO in the past that look similar to what you describe:The first is what people here refer to as a [poor man's covered call (PMCC)](https://www.tastytrade.com/definitions/poor-man-covered-call) where you buy a LEAP call and sell short-dated calls. MFO used this strategy in the past for DIS.The other is called a synthetic covered call where you sell a LEAP put, buy a LEAP call, and sell short-dated calls. MFO used this strategy in the past for BRK/B.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 11:15:31'] It's a vertical spreadhttp://imgur.com/a/PfdFbhVLet's look at the options individually, the first one is just buying a call option that will make $ if apple is above the strike + cost basis at expiryThe second will limit the potential max profits if apple goes above it's strike price of $135, and the value of the two options cancels above that price - however, selling this one lowers your cost basis so you don't need as much capital to utilize this strategy
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 14:43:56'] It sounds like a debit call spread but idk why they would recommend such a long expiration. Debit spreads can profit slightly with a favorable stock price movement alone, but they get much more profitable the closer they are to the expiration date (I just learned this). This sounds like more of a play maybe for the next couple weeks or so.The max profit would be the difference between the strike prices multiplied by 100, minus what you paid for it. So [(135-120) x 100] - 615 = $885 this is the most you could possibly make on this trade. Because this is a debit spread, you’d need to have the 615 upfront in order to open it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:40:13'] Your post is unclear. Are they telling you to put on a debit spread, a buy/write or a Poor Man's Covered Call?Debit Spread:Buy to Open 120cSell to Open 135c
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 15:10:52'] It’s just a debit spread. Your max profit would $1500 - the price you paid to open it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 18:22:06'] It’s a vertical spread that’s long delta (bullish). Better than just a naked call since you’re also selling premium and that lowers your total risk.However, I personally wouldn’t long delta when $QQQ is at ATH. A short term pull back is likely, especially since it looks like the market is entering Gamma Squeeze mode.The best short term play is to do nothing and buy the dip (after small correction), or hedge with $VIX calls.I’m personally doing positive Vega straddles (buying call and put at same strike) for the next few days before going back into bullish vertical spreads.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-31 10:35:40'] There is no "catch." Covered calls and cash secured puts don't carry any greater risk than simply holding the underlying. In terms of GOOGL, if you have the capital to sell a put, go for it. Most people don't have that type of capital to trade with.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-31 20:35:46'] $288,000 is a lot of collateral to tie up in one trade.  As an alternative you could by a deep ITM LEAPS on GOOGL.  The Sep 16th 2022 $2300C would cost around $70,000, this free's up $218,000 to use in other trades.Then sell weekly CC against your long call, to generate a weekly income of around $500-$1000 (depending on your risk level).

It could wipe out a lot of the gain you head even if the stock goes up in value. Maybe take a look at the greeks and see where delta is compared to vega. You can kind of predict what will happen to the stock after earnings but increasing the price but dropping the iv back to normal levels.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 04:31:04'] How do you determine the proper exit range for profitable long calls?    \- look at technical analysis for signals  \- determine if the fundamentals have changed  \- look for ominous signals in the market  \- sell when the underlying is overvalued    Reality check?  If anyone could do the above with any kind of consistency, we'd be subscribing to their newsletter services and we'd be outperforming.  Kiss the day job goodbye!!! Uh-huh...    Other than hindsight, there is no way to know where the ideal exit price is.  So the best that you can do is manage the trade:   \- Avoid high theta decay (roll or close before then).    \- Use trailing stop orders.    \- Book partial profits when profitable, lowering cost basis at risk.    \- Convert to other strategies to reduce risk (long call becomes CC or  PMCC).    \-At the expense of delta, roll long calls up in order to book profits and reduce cash at risk.  If you want to soften to hit to total delta, buy slightly more calls at the higher strike while still booking a gain.      Anything that you do, including doing nothing, can improve or reduce your P&L going forward.  The future is unknown.  Accept that.  The best you can do is to do what makes the most sense today and accept the consequences.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-08 14:32:42'] The truth is you locked in your position once you sold those calls.  It's hard to not leave yourself with a sell low / buy high situation when you manage these as once you BTC the short calls you lock in the loss and leave yourself open to the stock dropping taking your long call gains with it.  At the end it's going to be up to your personal discretion as you are proposing timing the market, and anyone who says they know what's going to happen is probably lying.  Your position is doing exactly as it should, imo, and you actually want the stock to rise as you only forego opportunity cost instead of actual cost.  Looking at the contracts: you have .67 delta from the long and only short .37, I personally would just let the trade play out as you aren't really in such a bad spot.&#x200B;"worst case" the stock hits 140 and you walk away with a profit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-08 18:21:58'] The Street consensus for AAPL has a price of 150$. There's also that analyst called Mitch Steves ranked number 17 out of 7432 analysts with a success rate of 80% that predict a price of 171$ for Apple.Looks like you were trying to do a calendar spread, but the price is just going up too much. I would suggest to close your short calls position right now that volatility is super low. It sucks, but now is the best time unless you have the balls to hold. It might hit 140$ by the end of April. I am not too sure what was the premium that your received initially, at what price your start losing money badly?

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-12 12:08:06'] I think when buying leaps you just gotta know what your breakeven is and be confident about the stock going above that. I have a few aapl leaps where the breakeven is around 135. not worried about that shit at all. plus I'm selling PMCCs on it and getting my cost basis even lower slowly but surely. shit's going to print.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-12 14:14:28'] Been piling up AAPL 2023 leaps. My strategy is simple, but on red days, 2 at a time. Sit back and sell PMCC on Green Days. Working fine so far. As for break even, it only matters on expiry. So plan on getting out of your leap 3-4 months before and get the next one. If you are in apple, it’s sure to print money.

POST_TEXT: b'I like iron condors as they are delta neutral but lately I feel like a broken wing butterfly might be the better option when there could be some run up. However I feel like verticals are better if you think you cant perfectly predict the volatility and are more easily managed by rolling for credit. After earnings I went into a put spread on AAPL 6/18 120/125 and collected a nice credit of about $1k. I dont think the underlying will continue to fall but am conservative thus the spread. Question is if my vertical isnt being tested after 1 week and I can gauge the movement would it be wise to leg in to a condor at 145/150 (well see next Friday about wing pricing) to collect more premium or should I ride it out or at least cash out at 50% profit on the original trade and move on to free up capital. As they say profits are profits and the way I see this going (no significant movement) if I can get some theta decay and sell for 50% max profit thats cool too.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-02 20:02:59'] It depends on your outlook (are you bullish or neutral?) and also it depends on what your trading plan calls for. When you put on a short vertical spread, what is your profit target? What do you do if you don't reach your profit target but you have some profit? At what point do you roll out in time? All these questions must be answered before you put a position on so that as the market moves you are simply executing the plan that you already designed. Of course, things can change and sometimes you can override your plan but you always need to have a trading plan in place and execute it as closely as possible.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-02 20:49:13'] Remember one thing about iron condors, it’s psychological rather than technical.You doubly increase your odds that you are wrong.I know that sounds obvious. But think how often you are wrong on options. I’m having incredible months, and I’m still wrong a lot.You open that bear call on the other side and it blows past? You are now killed both ways. Of course you can manage it but it’s a psychological self analysis you needIf I’m going to open an IC, I want to enter that IC, I don’t like legging into it

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 19:31:52'] Depends on your risk tolerance and what your trading strategy is. FYI, when you roll your calls you are essentially accepting a 80% realized loss on the June calls just to open another OTM position on AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 20:45:49'] IMO you need to forget your entry price and pretend you bought those positions today. Would you think there is a 10%, 20%, 30% return to be had? If so, sell then. Second, consider consolidating and rolling down to a lower strike. You won't have as many contracts, but you'll potentially be in a stronger position.On the other side, strengthen your nerve, this is a shaky market and money is lost by closing out too early. There is a good shot Aapl will get to 131\~133, I'd sell then.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 20:32:45'] Don't mean to be a bubble burster, but AAPL won't hit $150 by September. You're asking for a 41% uptick in revenue to occur in 4 months. This means you believe Apple is going to become a 3T market cap company in just a 4 months? Not happening. Roll down and out and throw more money to recoup, or roll into some weeklies or something to scalp some price action changes until you  break even.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 05:48:17'] 135 by June more likely than 150 by Sept IMO but I’m just a guy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 06:40:03'] At -80%, I’d probably just hold them and hope for the best.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 20:47:58'] Aapl just paid its dividend.  So there's no real reason to have a big move with everything going on with the fed and inflation chatter. .  At least that was my experience in Feb and I had March 31 131 calls. But if I've proven anything it's that I don't know what the heck is gonna happen next
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-16 04:04:49'] AAPL just issued its dividend, so the shares automatically go down to accommodate the payout, usually they bounce back up a bit after payout, but AAPL doesnt seem to be moving up these days. I might consider selling covered calls on the weeklies.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-29 10:03:22'] The only way to trade options in a non-margin account is to hedge yourself using a non-margin account. For instance, if you held this position in your 401K, you could have also sold a credit spread in a margin account for the same expiration at 200/210 or so, which would have removed a lot of your risk. If AAPL rose, you'd have a nice gain in your 401K, along with a capital loss in your margin account. Conversely, if AAPL fell (which it did), you'd have a nice gain in your margin account, which is taxable, but it would offset some of your loss in your 401K.&#x200B;Also - NEVER TRADE ON HOPE, EVER. &#x200B;Manage your risk going forward (no more than 5% of your portfolio in a single position) and perhaps stay away from options unless you have an intimate understanding of them.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-29 10:06:39'] Your analysis was wrong, and it happens.  At this point, you only have 10% left to risk and exp is 2 1/2 weeks away so you rode it this long why not ride it further to see if it pops back up?  It appears your other choice is to close it so you don't throw good money after bad.As you should have a trading plan that would have triggered you to close this at a preset loss amount and limit the loss, you may want to set a point to close if the stock does move up.  All it will take is a China trade deal and AAPL should jump up.The lesson you should learn here is that you should have preset profit and loss triggers to close the position at a preset amount to avoid major impacts to your account.  Set these BEFORE making the trade as emotions can take over and you can find yourself holding on to a bad trade longer than you should.  No one can tell what a stock will do, or what macro market news may do, but you can control how much you lose based on these preset triggers.The difference between a successful options trader and one that loses is one has a solid proven trading plan and the other doesn't . . .

Make sure you study a lot before buying options or you’ll have no money very soon. Very few people should trade options in a retirement account that’s what a “play” account is for.  Apple could still get to $195 around that time but doubtful. Very doubtful. Anyone that buys options has to know exactly what they can risk and be OK with it. They also need to know how to make a bad option play work before it gets out of hand. You really never should  lose 100% because you better damn well have a strategy that precludes the max loss on an option. In other words, you better have a hedge lined up. If you don’t know simple concepts like Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD stop gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-29 12:51:25'] The lesson you should really learn is, not to trade your 401K! Save up your own money to trade on the side but don't risk blowing up your 401k retire ment account!

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-30 01:20:20'] I learned some hard lessons that were costly also.  I suggest you learn about risk management techniques including position sizing.  Another option strategy to consider is selling credit spreads in your 401K account, if they allow it.  It will cut your risk way down if done properly.  If you cannot watch the market because of time constraints you can also learn to use stops to automatically exit at a predetermined loss amount.  You should always determine your max loss and strategize your exits before you place your initial order.  You should also strategize how and when you will take your profits before you place your initial order. Have a plan for each position you take already in mind for market ups, downs, and sideways movements. Then you only need to follow your game plan.  If you are just starting our with options, you may want to limit your account to around $2500.  You can still test all the strategies that you are allowed in your 401K account without risking too much.  I know that using real money helps me learn how to handle the emotional end of investing while a paper-trading account will not.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-30 03:28:50'] As a 31 year old professional, two advices-1. Don’t play with your 401k. Minor tweaking like putting money into some selected mutual funds rather than just a target retirement bond is totally fine. Refrain from putting your 401k money in options. Ping me separately if you want to know where you can put it to better use.2. For naked calls, consider taking LEAPs. No less than an year to expiration.3. Set some money aside for options trading.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-30 17:39:35'] Always limit your trade to 1% of your portfolio, max 2. Max ongoing trades need a hard limit, say 3 or 4. Follow a system and have a stop loss, say if the option loses 10-20% you would exit no matter what even if the stock shows signs of a rebound, you exit calls if it hits your stop loss so your portfolio lives to trade another day. Or take the other side, making a straddle/strangle - but this is even riskier because of range bound choppiness. Now, this does not apply to yolo trades!
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-29 09:55:31'] If you can move your 401K account to a broker that allows spreads, that would be the first thing to do.Having to be long on every trade, without the nuances of a spread, makes it impossible to adjust your risk, at the front end, or later on when a trade needs attention.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 15:13:28'] What do you mean by what could go wrong? Straddles are priced based on implied volatility. This strategy wins when you have outsized moves, and loses when you have undersized moves. You lose every day that your ITM leg isn’t far enough ITM to cover the premium you pay for the straddle. By employing this strategy, you’re basically betting that ES straddles are continually underpriced daily.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 18:32:30'] Try it for a year, then report back.If it turns out to be a losing strategy, then surely you can do the opposite approach to win by selling ATM straddles.Well, try that for a year and report back."If it was that easy, ..."
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 15:10:28'] I checked something similar on spx. On a regular day, an atm straddle (or close if closing price isn’t exactly at the strikes) is priced around $3000 previous night. Its way more on event days like fomc - sometimes even double. Its around $5600 today. Said differently - MMs are typically pricing in a 30 point move. This strategy can make money if the move is greater than that. Sadly on the first few days I tried, market decided to have slow days (less than +/- 30). Expensive strategy. You’ll need a big balance and be prepared for several consecutive day of losses. On the contrary - huge pay days on momentum days with 1.5-2% moves. Best!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 20:29:05'] Lol. Yes. Infinite money glitch. Market markets have no clue what they are doing when they price options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 17:02:12'] 1. There is never any pin risk if you are long options. You have the right to exercise.2. ES options convert to ES futures (except on the four quarterly expirations when they settle for cash).3. You are better off with SPX index options because they settle for cash.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 18:27:56'] You know that paper trades always execute, and that sometimes trades in real life don’t, right?Your paper trading profits on this stuff are worthless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 04:27:57'] Remember ES has 90% odds of breaking the overnight high or low during rth, so 0dte straddles have very high odds of paying if you get later in the day without a break of the range.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 06:07:14'] I wrote some code to track this type of thing but it’s for selling the straddle instead of buying it. If you were to sell, make sure you’re getting at least $54.77 in premium at day open for the 0 DTE. I’d have to think through the logic of the other way around. I’m not positive it’s as simple as making sure you pay less than $54.77 but it could be?

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-25 11:39:24'] The elephant is if there is a crash, your index funds will be hit hard. You may be forced to make some difficult decisions.Crashes are rare events. However, even a 10 percent hit is likely to make you extremely uncomfortable.Ballpark at the delta you are selling, 10 percent of the time, you'll have issues. Maybe 1 or 2 percent will be really unpleasant. At those percentages, once or twice a year it's going to be really bad. I'm not factoring in the crash scenario, which is more like once every ten years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-25 11:47:54'] Is .30 worth it? I don't think so. That's not enough premium (or time) for the risk you're taking on.If you were eager to be long 100 shares of AAPL that'd be another story, but it sounds like assignment would result in some forced liquidation on your end.Personally, I'd look at 30 delta about 30-60 days out. I'd only make your trade if I were ready to pull the trigger on 100 shares and wanted to scrape some premium and wait for a better price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-25 12:30:05'] I have been selling naked strangles on AAPL and the premium all adds up. I usually like to go 60 days out and +/- 20% from the strike price. Just set stops if selling naked makes you nervous. On high quality stocks and ETFs going far out of the money with some time gives you decent returns, margin of safety and the flexibility to roll if needed. Schaefer puts this kind of trade in his conservative options strategy group. Realistically you will never see a max loss on AAPL, SPY, QQQ or IWM.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-15 20:53:19'] I'd probably be nervous about 125 after the lack of movement today.  It really kept hitting a ceiling around 118 so it feels ambitious that it could hit 125 in two months (which is really closer to 130 to get to break-even.)Plus the election is in there, which poses uncertainty.  And there are lot more unemployed people right now who won't be upgrading iphones for a while.I'd personally go lower than 125.  But hey, I missed buying calls on Apple and Tesla all summer, so don't listen to me : )  It's always possible given that tech probably hasn't fully "settled down yet."

	COMMENT: ['2019-10-20 06:20:15'] OP, some of the other commenters are partially incorrect - it's not a straddle (as the put/call strikes have to be the same) but it's also not a strangle. A strangle would have the put strike lower than the call strike, look up the P/L diagram of a strangle and compare it to a straddle and you'll hopefully see what I mean
	COMMENT: ['2019-10-20 02:58:01'] A straddle has both strike prices the same.  A strangle is similar but uses different strikes.  So it looks like you did a strangle.

	COMMENT: ['2019-10-20 07:16:43'] Piece of advice: don’t execute this until you understand IV Crush and Theta Decay. Your return will be closer to one day ahead depending on this.

That allows you to collect some premium for the margin you have to post and plays into the probability that the recovery is likely to come quickly with big moves when it comes. Whether you do LEAPS or a Synthetic, you’re going to want to find the bottom and I have no clue how to do that. I’m not a chart guy and I suck at guessing direction, I’m a strategy guy who trades volatility 95% of the time. That said, in my view we’ve got some more downward pressure. Given that stance, probability is with you if you take the opposite side of my view since I guess wrong more than 50% of the time.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-14 20:28:23'] Just bought 3 Jan 2021 220 calls yesterday with similar logic.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-14 21:08:12'] You know, that far out in time - a 6/21 230 call is still 40d. It's like 0.6% up the call wing from the atm strike. Your trade analysis reads like you want to buy long duration cheap wings, but what you're actually looking at will perform very badly on a downward move if it's not hedged. &#x200B;Keep in mind the timeline you're trading from. You're making a long term play, which means you'll have to endure significant price moves against you and not be stopped out. If AAPL goes to 160 and sits for six months and then makes its way to 200 over the next six, your calls will look like shit. You'll probably still be down like 33% on your calls even with a 6% increase in AAPL price. &#x200B;I guess what I'm trying to say is that they're really not that cheap. If you want to make a ratio play with steeper calls up the slope that could be interesting, but as they look right now it isn't that enticing.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-14 22:09:14'] The 2020 Sep Calls @ 200 were $1975 a contract.. breakeven is close to ATH’s (kinda) gives you over a year for Apple to COMPLETELY RIP YOUR SHIT UP
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-15 05:21:20'] In lieu of simply naked calls, maybe consider some call spreads so you minimize your risk, but also your reward. Buy the 230's and sell the 250's, or something along that line. Legging into a call spread can  prove to be pretty advantageous, as long as you hold the 230 calls for a short period of time. When the price rebounds a bit, then complete the leg and sell the 250's. Also, set your buy limits low and let the share price come to you. It may sit for months without getting filled, but at least you have a slight edge buying at a lower price than buying in between the spread on any given day.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-15 05:59:06'] I had bought  Jan 2021’s at $150, $170, and $185 back in January. It was such a good call to do that. At the peak a couple weeks ago, the $185’s had tripled. I bought them bc I thought Apple was severely undervalued with a lot of runway ahead. I’m looking to buy more leaps at $200+, but I don’t think it’s as easy of a slam dunk as it was in Jan. I’m waiting for a bigger pullback. I’m also waiting for a bigger pullback on Facebook before buying leaps. I missed buying them at $160. That’s another slam dunk and they aren’t impacted by China.

POST_TEXT: b'I\'m going long AAPL and trying to figure out a longer duration play. I noticed that the deep ITM Jan 21 calls seem remarkably cheap:\n\n**Jan 2021 90 call - currently priced at 25.15.**\n\nWith AAPL at 112.75 at the close, this is **$22.75 of intrinsic value**, and **$2.40 of extrinsic** for an option 4 months till expiration. The breakeven price is 90 + 25.15 = 115.15, so if AAPL moves up 2%, we\'ll be at breakeven. This sounds incredibly likely. We were literally trading above 115 the day before.\n\nAt its current price its basically saying "this option is a win if in the next 4 months AAPL ever trades 2% higher than where it is today. And btw, today is a 1 month low"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing anything? Why is the extrinsic value incredibly small?

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-16 21:57:37'] When you get into deep ITM options it becomes more like buying the stock on margin than buying options.Another way to think of this is that if the seller buys the stock and sells a call against it they can get a free $2.40 held against $90 with low risk over four months. That's 2.7% over four months or about 8% per annum. With the return on bonds being so low right now, the risk/return for the other side of this trade doesn't seem bad. Their only downside comes if AAPL drops below $90, but they would likely unwind the position before that if it started to fall.edit: with a \~80c dividend it's actually about 15% / yr.

Since I believe in apple stocks I am ready to own these in the long run and keep the shares myself. Thinking to buy the leaps to reduce cost (so increase the buying power). Could anyone please suggest if that is the right move and also shed some light on the IV - as what number is considered high IV  range and what is low IV range (is 0-50% is low IV?)?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-10 21:59:39'] Take this info from me, if you trust a 17 year old. Ive traded options for a while, and I consider a 39% IV low-intermediate, leaning towards the low side. It would be beneficial to use market chameleon if you have these kinds of questions. Apple’s overall implied volatility is 30.9%, not 39% (however, for a contract dated that far out, 39 is reasonable). Its IV is currently 21.4% under its implied volatility’s 20 moving average of 39.4, and it is 29.3% below its 252 day historical volatility moving average of 43.7%. Implied volatility oscillates towards the mean, so theoretically implied volatility should ramp back up a little which is great for buying options. You get in at low IV (low Iv=low price=currently undervalued) and options inflate in value as IV goes back up to the mean. For your contract with 39% IV, it should also ramp up and right now is probably great timing on getting in cheap for IV.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-10 22:27:07'] No no no. You buy LEAPS off charting and look for lows or periods when your target is stuck in-range.Do not blindly go seeking LEAPS with some jr. quant approach like “good to go if IV is ____”You need to study Apple. Know Apple. Get a feel for its sector and the Qs on the day you’re looking to buySome shitty Tim Apple news in conjunction with a few bad days on the NDAQ? *Sweet* now wait a few more days and don’t buy till there’s some overall market beta-tank on some more shit news.Entry is everything on LEAPS—everything.If you enter a position when something has just entered a new range-bound trajectory for months? You’re kinda fucked and the opportunity cost is huge.If you entered the position when the underlying was 20% off an ATH and dropping that day—and comparatively 80% cheaper than when not bought on a dip? BOOM.Big difference between 175% annual returns and 45%—entry is and can be that important in every trade.Finally... you’re fucked with AAPL. You need five more stocks.Only one if you’re lucky will be in a good position for entry when you want to invest.You need to keep/acquire a stable of more companies you know things about so that when they offer entrys that will print, you see the chance.And stop thinking about whether or not IV is high or low. Find your stocks, and search and work for an entry as to share price low. Your IV concerns now are meaningless when you’ve absolutely no way to foresee future IV conditions at expiry or later-on, and you’ll never actually be able to tell if it’s overpriced or cheap.

My question is owning 10 contracts would I be better selling the options when I see a very comfortable return.  Presently in the $34 to $35 range and my entry is under $22.  They are the same 03/17/23 and I would love to own 1000 shares of Aapl at the likelihood that near expiry this stock will be worth upwards of $200  and the ability to print premium having 1000 shares to sell calls on with alot of control and already built-in profit of likely $50 a share.Selling the options would take me out me from the Aapl story at likely around $7500 a contract.  Turning $22,000 into $75,000.But if I exercise I'm like an additional $$130,000 on top of the $22,000 already paid for the options.   So have $152,000 into something that could earn me $1000's of dollars of premium over a lifetime or $53,000 and I just walk.I think what I might do is hold out as long as I can sell as many contracts as I need to to cover my initial $22,000 outlay I'm guessing only 3.  And exercise for the shares on the other 7 thus costing me $91,000 on the other 7 contracts 700 shares. What does everyone think is the best course of action.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 04:20:26'] this sound kinda complicated, i get the idea and dont disagree with it. In the long term i think youd be fine if it keeps going up. If it crashes hard  though you would be at a loss. 100 shares of apple IMO is always good
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 05:26:36'] You gotta figure out the net delta. Let’s say the long call delta + long put delta = 0 (which it should at the same strike), that’s purely long volatility. You think AAPL will move more than the market expects, either bullish or bearish. The covered calls are a whole separate strategy. The issue is, say you keep writing covered calls as the stock skyrockets. And you keep getting assigned. Then you’ve got 0 shares of stock for a period of time until you buy 100 more shares. You’ve still got the long call. If you end up with 0 shares of AAPL during January 2021 and the put is ITM and exercised, you’ll be short 100 shares. If you still have your 100 shares and the call is ITM and you exercise the option, now you’ve got 200 shares. Obviously these scenarios are unlikely/impossible if the position is managed well, it’s just important to remember because mismanaged positions result in margin calls.Also writing weekly calls is already a hedge. Stock delta is 1, short calls reduce delta, but are long time and short volatility as well. Selling calls also effectively lowers the cost basis of your shares when the calls expire worthless.You’ve got some good ideas, but I’d read a little more before putting $34000 into various options plays.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 09:16:57'] In general, I think people pay way too much to hedge tail risk. Buying a 2021 put as a hedge will be extremely expensive. You want your hedge to cost a tiny fraction of your main investment (the long call). Think of it like this. You buy a house for $500k, would you pay a $500k premium for fire insurance that only protects you for 1 year? When the chance of your house burning down is 3 out of 100?Furthermore, if the purpose of the long call is to capture upside potential above the CC, why pick an expiration in 2021? The further out you go, the more expensive it is, so the harder it has to work to make a profit. Why not just buy something that is just 30 days out and roll it?While I don't mind using shares to write calls against, you could consider a reverse ratio spread as a way to combine the CC with the long call. You might save some money doing so, without sacrificing too much.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 09:18:07'] Sell CSPs, don't sell naked. Have the actually cash to buy 100 shares.Sell weeklies, should do well.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 05:53:43'] A modified version of what you are thinking of doing is this, will be easier post-split after share price drops.1. Purchase 100 shares.2. Sell covered calls on those shares.3. Sell cash secured PUT as a side play. You will receive income from the CSP and the CC. If you get assigned you get those shares at a discount.Cash-secured-put (CSP) is a great way to earn income and buy shares at a discount, but it can be a bit slow with how much premium you collect, especially if you are bullish on a stock such as apple. So the shares + covered calls helps you earn a bit more income. Just my 2 cents.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 06:10:11'] **There is a 4 for 1 stock split coming.**If you wait until after the split you’ll be able to get 100 shares for less.If you do it before the split, you’d have 400 shares to sell covered calls on
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-15 06:35:09'] This play are actually two strategies combined:The two long options form a straddle, that if opened ATM is a neutral strategy. With it you essentially bet that apple moves more than what you paid for the options in any direction. So if apple moves up or down ~ 90 USD until Jan 2021 you make a profit, otherwise you lose with this strategy. Another way to earn money with a straddle is to bet on an increase in implied volatility of the stock. This is why this strategy can be played before earnings to benefit from the increase in volatility.The second strategy is just a covered call. Here the main risk is in AAPL dropping in price. There is also an opportunity risk, when AAPL rapidly moves to the upside. In this case you would earn less than if you hadn't sold the call.Overall the combination of the two strategies doesn't give you much. The Covered Call performs best if AAPL slowly increases in price and the Straddle performs best if AAPL moves significantly in either direction.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 13:53:05'] Your strategy is solid and I’ve been running with a similar game plan.Just a few things to keep in mind. Don’t over leverage. Premiums right now may seem like free money but tech can unexpectedly crater very, very quickly causing a lot of stress and possibly a margin call. Play within your means. Also, just because they are great companies at reasonable prices doesn’t mean they can’t tank another 20%. Just don’t relax too much

Did you get on the good side of vega? How did you know that IV was going to contract? Did you know in advance what the Fed minutes was going to say? How much of your play was delta, theta and vega? Did you specifically plan to sell the AAPL put after earnings? why did you sell one before and one after earnings? Do you have an opinion on earnings volatility? Were you trying to scalp the movement of the options? What if it had gone against you? Would you have hedged? Would you hedge with options or with stock?You see -- there's 100 different factors to consider beyond a straight up or down.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 06:00:02'] Hard to say exactly why, but it's probably someone seeking essentially 1 delta for slightly cheaper than buying the stock outright. Theta decay is basically nil and you get (almost) complete exposure to the stock movement.As always, it could just be one leg to a bigger trade. For example, it could be the long leg to a vertical spread (in which case it would essentially be like the long stock in a covered call).
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 06:47:02'] Someone wants to sell their AAPL stock in 2021, but use the cash for something else in 2020.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 08:31:15'] the strategy is called stock replacement. as mentioned, you can get very close to a 1.00 theta so it’s like owning the stock for cheaper than buying it. you wouldn’t necessarily need to go as low as  a $25 call, but you get the idea. since your extrinsic value will be very low, you could buy a long call deep in the money for a super long expiration for a much better price compared to an OTM call.additionally, you can sell OTM calls in the short term to hedge/make money against your long call (essentially turning it into a diagonal bull call spread). this hype of hedging works well for short term turbulence - if you think the stock will get hit hard, you can short the stock while staying long the option to make it so you don’t lose any money as the stock goes down, then close your short position when you’re bullish again.!!!warning!!! be careful of liquidity when you’re opening a long position in a deep ITM contract. look at open interest to make sure that you’d be able to close your position when you want. otherwise you may be stuck riding it out to expiration.

I'd rather have less profit now than maybe more profit in the future, if there is a chance I can lose any of the current profit by holding.You can close the trade and open a new one with part of the profit, if you think there is still upside. Bank 20%, put 80% back to work is a good way to build your bankroll. Closing now lets you re-enter at a lower cost basis.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 05:46:30'] Informative, thank you. Looks like legacy FAANG still has room to move up while mid-caps may be over-extended at this point.Possible cause for market movements being determined by institutional flow or options trades could be the somewhat low volume we saw in January.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 12:48:07'] Isn't VIX all screwed up since last April when CBOE started listing SPX options expiring every trading day?  Probably way more volume for the near term versus next term expirations now compared to when they last updated the calculation back in 2003 right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 08:32:16'] GEX prints have been close to the 2B-3B range hence the bulls holding the control as of late. When that number starts to come down and go negative then we can expect volatility to rise and less of the choppy and low atr days. A rise in IV will cause GEX to drop - should be good for the bears
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 09:29:55'] It's evident the vix is very much being manipulated with insane moves being met with very very little move in iv. As soon as market makers start to drop their hedges on an uptick in iv and a downtrend in price you will see a potential very fast collapse. Market makers and anyone that sold naked calls are fucked right now. Market makers never hedge perfectly and this is likely what we are seeing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 14:07:50'] Normally you would want to roll further out in time instead of rolling the strikes down. However, being so close to the expiry you might just want to close the position for a loss if you don't think AAPL will be above your short strike at expiry. Though you could just hold it and see, one of the benefits of using risk defined trades like spreads is that you can let it be and be ok so long as you didn't overallocate funds to the trade
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 14:08:55'] Well, there is virtually no danger of early assignment unless Apple falls a whole heckuva lot (well under 120).  So I'd wait and see what it's doing Friday before deciding anything.  There's a really good chance it bounces back.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-07 04:47:57'] I have this same position! Excited for opening. Let me know what you end up deciding, I'm very curious.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 14:14:17'] As I write this, AAPL is trading at $126.60. If the price does not move between now and expiration (or it stays above $126), your options will both expire worthless, and you will make your max possible profit.Your concerns are valid, though, as a lot can happen in the next 2 days. First and foremost, you'll only end up with long AAPL position if AAPL ends up between $125 & $126. Your $125 put would expire worthless, and you'd be assigned on your $126 put. You'd have to have $12.600 per contract to cover this assignment and pay for the shares, but don't panic if you don't have the money:  \- Your broker might exit the entire spread for you before Friday's market close if you keep the position (Robinhood does this for example)  \- Your broker might lend you the money to buy the assigned shares, and then sell them on Monday's open to get back the money they lent you. You face the risk that AAPL tanks over the weekend if this happens, though so take special care if this is the route you end up taking.If AAPL ends up below $125 before expiration, then both your options will be ITM; you'll still be assigned the shares at $126, but you'll get back $125 per share by exercising your long $125 put. You'll lose $1 per share, which is you max loss.  I'm probably not qualified to tell you what to do, but if you're a beginner, you're probably best off exiting the entire spread at some point before it expires. If you do this, then nothing happens at expiration, because you're out of the position.Rolling the spread means exiting this spread, and entering a new one with a later expiration. Do that if you think that AAPL will come back up before whatever new expiration date you choose.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-30 03:09:15'] AAPL has lost a lot of value very recently. Do you think there is almost a 0% chance of it recovering just 10$ by mid november?EDIT: You may be missing:* maybe stimulus gets approved quickly after election* iPhone sales are going to be up in the ramp up to the holidays, with stimulus they are going to be even higher
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-30 03:21:00'] Almost guaranteed is a bit of an oxymoron don't you think?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-30 05:32:49'] With diagonals you have to think about:1. Direction (delta exposure)2. IV difference between the legs (vega exposure)The chart from opcalc only shows delta exposure (i.e. if AAPL goes up or stays flat you make money).   What they do not show is IV changes between the legs.  With the election next week its very possible your short leg gets very expensive relative to your long leg in which case that entire chart will change you will be looking at a loss, even if the stock moves up slightly.  In my opinion time spreads (calendars, diagonals, etc.) are way more complex than people realize until you start trading a bunch of them and scratching your head wondering why your not making money despite what all the option calculators are telling you.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-30 17:10:25'] Let me give you a tip that will save you a lot of money."Almost guaranteed" is not a quantifiable state; if you can't say, "92%" or another number, then don't fucking do it. You'll thank me in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 20:44:52'] Seems like you basically just got the option premium.  Either roll it out and up, or close everything and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 20:45:44'] My experience with covered calls where you have a neutral to slightly up bias position that turns bullish upside where the negative leg is now blocking you from making money and costing you money is just to liquidate the negative leg and buy it back. It’s better to just eat it and reap bigger profits from the positive side of the trade. It’s too draining to roll it or play games with spreads.  You’ll make more money letting it go and moving on with your upside calls or stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 21:11:26'] I would not simply buy back the call right now. You can roll your option up to a higher strike (buy back the call and sell a new one). You’ll have to put more money down but you’ll capture more of the upside you gave up with the covered call. Can also roll it out to a later date or combine out and up (but I wouldn’t roll it out now, I’d wait since you have plenty of time).  You gave up a lot of upside but you haven’t lost any of your initial investment. If you do nothing and let the counterparty call your AAPL shares away in January, you’ll be left with $300 per share (near cost basis) plus the premium you received for selling the option. Better than a CD...
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 18:24:47'] First realize that the person who bought the call contract from you also gets the benefit of the stock split.  So after the split, that call option contract will be for 400 shares, not 100.

The stock currently trades at 219.46, which is **8.9% higher** than the close following its last reported earnings, trading with a range of 197.31 to 233.47 since that time.\n\n### Expected Price Volatility\n\nCurrently, option traders are expecting a ** 5.0%** move for this earnings, and during the previous earnings release, the stock experienced a **+5.9%** move. Over the last 12 quarters, the absolute average move has been ** 4.5%**, with a minimum move of 0.3% and a maximum move of 6.6%. AAPL has experienced **7** larger-than-expected earnings moves in the last 12 quarters. '
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-01 11:00:37'] I'm too afraid AAPL will shit the bed with guidance I sold my calls today.  My main concerns: reports of reduced Chinese consumer demand, strong USD and weak CNY eating into margin, any mention of the "T" word by CFO.  The only reason I'm not holding puts is theres a chance that even with fairly crappy guidance it'll go up like FB because bad news is already priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-01 10:04:04'] Noob question:so if the move is larger than expected, then a straddle is profitable?
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-01 10:25:52'] All this analysis tells me is that these options are relatively fairly priced. The expected move is right above historical average and that makes sense given short selling is inherently riskier. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-01 23:22:51'] Great story. They'll miss earnings hard IMO. Nice short i'd say a 10-14% drop in the next five days.

POST_TEXT: b'&#x200B;\n\nHi all, \n\nI wanted to have your input on a blunder I made and hope I can get your wisdom.\n\nI bought an OTM bull put for AAPL for 115/105 on Thursday based on a low delta probability, and figured my max loss to be (width of spread-premium received) which was about $700. This is lower than my usual acceptable max loss of $900 per trade.\n\nUnfortunately, I failed to consider that isnt a true max loss, because if your spread is OTM, as soon as it starts moving towards your short strike you will already start losing money. When AAPL started tanking Friday morning and even before touching 115, I was already in the red by $670.  I closed it because I feared an acceleration if price crossed the short strike price.\n\nAs we know AAPL did a turnaround all the way to even ending on a gain. That was unpredictable and even if I had any hair left I wouldnt pull it out because I accept shit happens. \n\nMy question: \n\nWhat would you have advised in this situation? Was there anything I could ha'
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 10:20:24'] It seems to me that you were not aware of the positive delta of your trade. I recommend looking at the full picture of your exposure when entering or holding a position.With every options position:1. Know what to expect if the underlying goes up, lingers, or goes down.2. Know what to expect as time marches on.3. Know what to expect if IV goes up or goes down.4. Know how the above expectations change as time marches on, as the underlying goes up or down, and as IV goes up or down. Because they change.

When AAPL started tanking Friday morning and even before touching 115, I was already in the red by $670. I closed it because I feared an acceleration if price crossed the short strike price.Almost none of this is true. See my second note below.Your max loss is $700. **That means your max loss is $700**. This applies as long as you don't let it expire.When you were down $670, you were almost at your max loss. There is nothing more to lose. You should've ridden it to near expiration.**TLDR**You took a literal gamble with approximately 1:3 odds. There is almost no management to be done other than to let the probabilities play out near the end of the day. 1DTE spreads are risky for this exact reason. A move in the underlying can send you near max loss pretty quickly because of gamma.**Another note:**If your spread was OTM, it's hard to believe that is was near max loss. It would most likely be priced around 50% the width. So there is something wrong here.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 11:32:15'] Please read MichaelBurryScott's reply. It's everything I was planning to say. And BTW, full position details would help clear things up, like the expiration. If you have 4 spreads, write -4 AAPL 115/105p x/xx. If you just write "I bought an ...", we are going to assume there is only one.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-05 10:20:09'] How do you buy a bull put spread? I assume this was a credit spread. Bought  the 105's and sold the 115's? How much did you take in when you initiated the trade?

POST_TEXT: b'I have been slowly purchasing AAPL stock since late 2014 and with DRIP I finally crossed the 100 share mark yesterday during the dip I grabbed a few. With a cost basis of $154.77, I want to put these to work as we approach earnings. I hold these inside a Roth IRA so capital gains luckily will not be an issue. \n\nI was thinking of doing a few "low risk" covered calls initially just to collect the premiums to ensure I have a feel for doing everything correctly. \n\nMy first thought was to do a 24 APR 290c for .30 when the market opens tomorrow.  Realizing I only collect $30 but there is very low risk of the price actually reaching 290 and getting called away. On the slim chance it does I won\'t be heartbroken if I have to part ways and I will just wait for a dip to get back in or look to invest elsewhere. \n\nFollowing that, I would look to do similar small premium covered calls.\n\nIf  there is a better strategy I am always willing to learn.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 17:28:13'] Good for you. I own a lot of Apple. And I do covered calls all the time, but I have a purpose. I go far out, bring in as much money as I can without getting called away. I would look at 320 -340 and bring in some real money. You’ll make a lot more this way then doing close to expiration covered calls. I also use a premium I receive for other options plays. Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 18:25:47'] If it’s covered and you are okay with selling at 290 then do a 315 c for June or July...you’ll get a few thousand and even if it goes up no one will execute h til it’s close to closing. You could also change it to a spread if you want to cut risk and buy a 325 for may29 and sell the June 305-or 310. This is guaranteed money, especially if aapl falls in next couple weeks you can close out the sold calls. If you get assigned you’ll make profit on your shares as well so it’s not that bad of a scenario as you will have opportunities to buy back in at cheaper price
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 18:59:45'] For what it’s worth I have AAPL June $210 puts. I think it’s going down. Supply chain issues out of China, lower demand, Apple stores closed. Lot of risk here.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 21:26:28'] A covered call is a good strategy. If you're trying to do an earnings play, you'll discover as the earnings date approaches implied volatility (IV) increases due to increased uncertainty about earnings. High IV means higher prices (more premium).  After earnings, it typical decreases. As an option seller, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when IV contracts.  You'll get paid more and pay less to close out your position. For an earnings play, sell close to the earning date.Also, for your expiration date, if you go further out in time, you will collect more. Although, AAPL has high liquidity, the monthlies have more liquidity than the weeklies. Right now, instead of collecting $.30 for 24 APR 290 call, you'd collect $5.75 for 15 May 290 call.  If you close your position at 25% max profit, you'd collect $1.40. 15 May will also give you more time if you're wrong in your assumptions.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 21:40:53'] I think going short calls at this point is a solid move. Consider that Apple dropped almost 40% at the end of 2018, from $232 to $142, and there was no virus, no global shut down, no recession. It's only about 15% off it's bubble peak now, so the odds of it making a major upside move are pretty slim I would wager.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 20:34:39'] Stop doing DRIPS. Take all your dividends in cash. That way, you get to put those dividends to work how and when YOU want to put them to work. Having large dollar amounts of "unusable" shares can be very costly.Take a look at the 1 May $300 - $305. Still have $25 + upside  and can do it again in 7 trading sessions. The $300 is paying $1.55.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 22:50:18'] How do you DRIP Apple?  TD... Robinhood?
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-23 17:24:42'] Great strategy if you are a mature investor and can weather reading other posts about people making more than you are.It is generally accepted to stay away from covered calls during earnings, or atleast increase the % away the strike isfrom the rolling (weekly/monthly) averagelet us know what you end up doing and good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 17:13:40'] Sure, just keep in mind that covered calls are considered a bearish strategy, but 290 is pretty far out of the money, especially so close to expiry. Obviously you're making $30 on $15,770.. Why not do May 1, like $300? Calculate the % per week, maybe?Also, AAPL truly is a decent stock to own, so I suggest you take the possibility of your shares being called away as riskier. Sure, you can move to something else, but you really don't want it to happen.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-22 17:37:49'] Do note that this market is very up and down. In your position I would sell a near ATM call and repurchase if called away (perhaps waiting a bit for a drop, or using a cash-secured put).Today I sold $52 SHAK APR 24 calls against my shares when SHAK was trading at $50.5. It took about two hours to reach 50% profit as SHAK dropped to 49. This is how intraday volatility creates short term opportunities. The downside is that you have to manage the trade closely; I was ready to roll come tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 06:43:42'] Indicators lose some degree of accuracy because they are derivatives.  For pairs trading, I prefer to remain in the price domain and use something like Comparative Relative Strength where you divide the price of one security by the price of the other.  If the issues correlate well, the graph of these quotients will ping back and forth in a range around zero.     Another way to approach it is to simply subtract the price of one security from that of the other.  It's the same idea as above except that you're plotting the actual price difference.    Indicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc. can be useful in identify a trend but any position taken is based on the hope that the trend continues. They predict nothing going forward.  They're all like looking in a rearview mirror, telling you where you have been. They'll work if you correctly guess the periodicity of the underlying but that is only truly known in hindsight.

POST_TEXT: b'A long time ago (2009) I threw some money into a little over 150 shares of apple and am still currently holding. Up until now I havent bothered to consider any sort of hedging but I feel that it would probably be wise given how volatile the market seems to be. My question is what option plays do you think would be best to go about this? \n\nMy best thought was to sell until Im down to an even 100 shares and then use long dated put spreads to hedge the rest. Something along the lines of buying a 2022 120 strike and selling a put further out the money (maybe by 30-40 dollars). The reasoning for the spread would be that it would allow me to have ample time to capitalize on theta decay while also being able to buy back in the event of a downturn trend before triggering the strike price. It feels ridiculous to do for only 100 shares but due to my cost basis being so low the entry price would be less than 2-5% of my shares market value and I cant think of any better methods. Long-term Im b'
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 06:15:14'] Cover calls? Sell at .1 or .2 delta to minimize risk of assignment? You could also buy a leap put ATM or far ITM to simulate short stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 17:26:16'] "Ample time to capitalize on theta decay"?If you buy an ATM put, you are pretty much maximizing the amount of extrinsic value you are paying for, and thus maximizing the amount of theta you are paying. Selling any other put may mitigate that, but your theta will always be negative.And, "buy back in the event of a downturn trend before triggering the strike price"? The whole point of hedging is that you can get rid of a failing stock at a predetermined price. If what you're trying to do is hold on to the stock (which you probably are if you're long term bullish) while making some extra in the meantime, then what you're looking for is the Covered Call. Sell 15-20 delta calls, put the profits into more stock, when you get to 200 shares sell even more calls! If it sees a unexpected rapid spike and you want to keep the stock, that's when you buy it back...

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-22 02:37:03'] Changes in IV will typically increase an option's *extrinsic* value leading up to an earnings announcement, and then decrease it immediately after. If you own a long option, then you'll see it's extrinsic value decrease after earnings as IV drops... But a directional move in the stock price can more than make up for it!Alternatively, some people choose to short (sell) options immediately before an earnings announcement, then close (buy) their position right afterwards, making a profit entirely from the IV drop.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-22 17:30:25'] IV will slowly increase until earnings then collapse afterwards.One strategy would be to hold until right before innings. If AAPL ramps up into earnings, that would help you. And the rise in IV will help. So that might turn out to be the best price you will get.The second strategy would be to hold through earnings and hope for a big pop. You would need a sizeable pop in the stock price to compensate for the resulting IV crush. Risky. If it doesn't pop, you stand to lose most of your investment. This would be the "gambling" approach. Some people like that.Strategy three would be to close the position and accept the current loss.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 18:44:50'] Was this done after hours? You're most likely going to struggle to get a fill on this during market hours. After hours options prices aren't always accurate.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 11:48:28'] So you have +2 at 120 and -2 at 123.75? So your buying 2 debit spreads. I don't see how this is a butterfly.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 18:44:17'] After markets closes the spreads on options widen to the point where you can find plenty of risk free trades but once option pricing updates on market open either the opportunity will cease to exist or you simply won’t get filled.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 18:58:54'] Lol. Click on the lock button next to the price on the simulated trade. That’s the first thing I check when I see something “too good to be true.”Edit: By the way, this isn’t a butterfly. Both of your long strikes are at 120. This trade is two debit call spreads with a limit price set at a credit.

POST_TEXT: b"Trying to find some better information so I can make the best play on this option.\n\nI purchased a contract for AAPL $395c 8/7 on July 20. Premium was $11.35. Apple was over $390 at the time with solid upward movement, until it reversed and dumped 2 days later. Premium dropped to about a third of the previous value. Decided to hold and hope for the best.\n\nToday it's climbing, up over $1.20 on the premium.\n\nSo the question is, if I hold this through earnings is it surely going to get IV crushed at open? Would it be advisable to hold the call through earnings or will it crash PM? Breakeven is $406.35.\n\nThinking about just cutting my losses and being happy I didn't lose it all.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 09:41:47'] If you only have one, what about selling end of day to capture high IV, then buy either more OTM tomorrow (if they beat) or the same option at a discount?Edit: if you had more than one contract I would say sell half if you’re carrying too much in this one position.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 09:55:17'] AAPL doesn't have amazingly high IV but IV might go down a bit after earnings so if you are nervous you should sell something before earnings.You could either sell your option and buy it back (or better yet, a call spread) after earnings, or you could turn your long call into a long call spread by selling an upside call. The 405c for your expiration is trading at $2.60 so if things don't work out at least you keep that and if your short call is threatened it means you are about to get max profit out of your whole position.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 10:14:18'] I mean u have lost over half already, might as well hold and hope for a good beat on earnings which could propel them.  At least they don't expire tommorow.Anymore I seldom buy calls or puts unless it is a spread.  You will be much better off if you start writing calls and puts, covered of course.  GL

POST_TEXT: b"So I've been wanting to do this for a long time but never really had enough capital until now.  I have done a lot of research on the subject though and use excel to figure out the nitty and gritty details.  Basically what I'm planning on doing is selling 1 strike wide spreads with either puts or calls on individual stocks.  I'm thinking to mitigate risk, the best tactic here is using names I am familiar with such as COIN, AAPL, TSLA, ETC and going short around .15 delta.  I also use the implied move (ATM straddle) as a metric to determine how far OTM to go.  I like the .15 delta but I would prefer going 2.5 to 3 times the implied move to be extra cautions.  My consensus is after looking at the data and extrapolating a little is that I can make around $1,500 a week with $25,000 per trade.  Does this seem like a viable tactic to use?  \n\nFor example next week, I am expecting the market volatility to be high so I am aware the market can go up or down a considerable amount.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 08:16:48'] Check your max loss on those trades. My recommendation is to trade 1 lots until you've done this a couple hundred times and have proved to yourself that you can do it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 07:13:50'] I'll chime in on what I found when trading credit spreads a long time ago.\- Expect to have losing positions which should be kept small with narrow spreads, but will add up.  Your goal will be to have more profitable trades that make up for the losing ones and this will take a long term view.  You may have 20 losing trades and 80 winning ones to find out if you can make an overall net profit.\- Learn how to manage credit spreads through rolling or adding the other side to make an iron condor.  Rolling may help turn some losers into winners, and making an ic will lower the max loss when one has to be taken.It will be up to you as the trader for how well you trade and the results.  $1500 a week on average when factoring in the losing trades seems aggressive, but you don't mention how much capital you are working with.  $1500 per week is about $78K per year which would would require a $500K+ account for an annual 15% returns.  This return would be be very difficult on 1 wide spreads as they bring in so little premium which would require thousands of trades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 07:50:49'] TSLA cannot be predicted, PERIOD.  Make no options play with TSLA without considering all possibilities, including going to zero.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 16:37:38'] don’t sell premium at its top.  once tsla announces its earning, there’s a good chance elon has to sell again.  collateralised the twitter debt with his stocks.  tsla is now trading much lower than what it used to be when he borrowed the money.  The bank wants the collateral to be a certain % of the total debt.  so Elon needs to pay down the debt when tsla is trading below that value.  every time he sells, tsla goes down.  because elon needs to satisfy that collateral obligation so elon will have to sell more to shore up the collateral obligations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 02:28:40'] What I often see is trying to predict the next price movement which I am not at all into it and I consider this to be a big mistake with a small exception. I wouldn't mind to squeeze as much premium before I risk to get assigned.There is nothing to guarantee that TSLA will not go below $100. On a daily chart there is a strong resistance at around $124.48 and that would be my confirmation for 2 consecutive days before I would write a put spread. I need a long confirmation to see if it would bounced back after such a long bear run. Holding such a position for 4-8 days (writing weeklies) personally I don't see it to be any good. I have no any edge and especially the IV, which I am talking about it later.The way i see it,  there is a very close imbalance that was formed on the 6/1 and is quite rich and might see the price moving downwards at these levels ($101.81), Writing puts now is not a good time unless getting assigned (with additional rolls and squeezing premium) compared to taking a loss is your plan. And don't forget that writing puts now you actually bet against the trend. We only see a small consolidation on the 4hrs chart.Don't forget that there important economical releases on the 18th and something tells me the IV will increase. Another thing on TSLA is that the IV has already started dropping compared the 2 weeks and 1 month ago and on a daily chart the IV is contracting. I wouldn't take into consideration of the IV Percentile (82%) at the moment as a good indicator but instead I find IV Rank more important and at the moment the IV of the past 52weeks is exactly in middle at 49%.I wanted briefly to describe an approach I usually follow. In general speaking there is nothing at the moment that gives me a confirmation whether I will be bearish or bullish yet.Back to you, I usually write at .2, .3 or .4 deltas especially on red days, or I have a good confirmation that the price is 'almost' guaranteed to move towards my way
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 10:18:38'] Also, if this is a $25k trade I would suggest having $25k cash to defend the trade if need be.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 21:30:59'] Because your premium per contract is so small, $3 in your example with TSLA, any fees are going to take a big bite out of your return.  At Schwab for example, each options contract is .65.  So your 3% is actually reduced to 2.35%.  If your broker charges you a fee for each leg of the contract, it could cut your return by 50%.  To do this effectively, you would need a broker that charges little or nothing for options orders.  Also, what is your plan in the unlikely but completely possible scenario where TSLA finishes the week at 99.50?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 21:54:45'] "Am I thinking about this correctly and is this a viable in the long term?"Only one to find out!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 04:46:35'] I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I have been giving this a lot of thought as well.  It's a strategy I have been backtesting and looking at for a while.  It works on $SPY and $QQQ, while I am sure it works on all underlyings I only looked at it on these two as these have higher priced options with multiple expiries per week.  Further, ETFs are a bit safer because they don't tend to see massive sustained movement in one direction or the other, while a stock can and will keep falling, or can and will squeeze higher for an unknown length of time.Basically, what you do is you throw the 4X Keltner Channels, set to 21 periods on your chart and the Keltner Channels set to 1X, also at 21 periods.  This gives you the average volatility of the month around the monthly mean (the 1X multiplier) and a band that encompasses 99.9% of all price data (the 4X) band.  Lastly, add the Choppiness Index to the chart.  This is an oscillator that measures whether something is trending or rangebound.  When a candle closes within the the 1X Keltner band and the Choppiness Index crosses and closes above the 50 level from below on the daily, you sell an Iron Condor for 3 weeks out. The closer the CI moves to 70 the more rangebound the stock is. Your short strikes are at the 4X band or just outside of it. This has a well over 90% hit rate over the past few years of backtesting I have looked at.  The key is you need to be okay with basically risking 6 or 7 to make 1.  On $SPY, the most recent time this happened was January 5th and you would have sold a $355/360/412/416 IC for Jan 27th expiry and taken in around $0.75-$0.80 in credit on a $5-wide risk.  As of Friday, you are up $0.40 or so on the position.  Eventually, the goal would be to move to a strangle (where you can stomach a large, naked position) as that will net you ~$2.00 in credit and allow a bit more flexibility in management.

Pretty huge difference in risk/reward from stock to stock if you really meant one strike wide.> I like the .15 delta but I would prefer going 2.5 to 3 times the implied move to be extra cautions.That all makes sense and is cautious, but understand that by minimizing your risk, you are also minimizing your reward. Credits on $1 wide spreads at 15 delta are going to be pretty small and may not be more than the required implied break-even for expected value. Assuming 15 delta has a 85% win rate, you'd need to get at least $.16 per dollar of spread width to be profitable.> My consensus is after looking at the data and extrapolating a little is that I can make around $1,500 a week with $25,000 per trade. Does this seem like a viable tactic to use?Is that best case or is that an average that includes inevitable losses? Best case, $1500 at $.16 per dollar of spread width means you need to be trading *at least* 94 spreads, assuming $1 wide spreads. That would only cost 9400 in collateral, not 25000, so something isn't adding up.You need to factor in at least a 15% loss rate to get a more practical (not best case) idea of your average return. Use [this equation](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result).> At a delta of .03, and at 3x the implied move, I can use even lever up on this trade because of my confidence.What happened to 15 delta? Did you mean 15 delta max, but you'd actually trade less? That worsens the risk/reward comment I made above.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 13:00:13'] You question is very basic and I'm surprised your selling puts on SPY.Please..for the sake of your account..practice on a cheap stock like $F.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 09:46:56'] Important to note when you sell a naked option (either call or put) and not a spread, you are posing yourself to greater value of loss than gain. The gain is limited to the premium received while the losses *could* be far greater. If this is new to you, recommend paper trading to keep you experiencing this for real. .02
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 09:00:28'] Regarding those puts, there's nothing to lose or cash out.  When you sell something short, you get cash *at the time the short sale occurs.*  If the short options then expire worthless, there is no further debit nor credit to your account, and you get to keep all the cash from the short sale.  That's your profit.The -766.1 unrealized could come from your 28 short TSLA calls, but we don't know what credit you received for those.  Or it could have something to do with the Jan 13 options not settling yet, or both.  Hard to say unless someone is very familiar with Interactive Brokers' interface, which I'm not.Edit: Never mind, the number in the column that has -28 isn't the quantity, it's that day's P/L.  What a confusing interface.  We can't even tell whether each position is long or short.  As usual, a screenshot is inadequate in conveying all the necessary information.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 15:07:09'] It's gonna cost you nearly 40 grand if you get exercised on a spy put. My mind is boggled you're selling those and your broker lets you. You must have started out with a decent sum of money. Be careful bro.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 16:45:25'] Holy shit dude if you are asking this question you should not be selling verticals on SPY. Seriously. Don't. Not until you understand the complexities behind it such as pin risk. You can legitimately lose more money than you have if you do this trade and do not adequately manage your risk. Consider yourself lucky with this one trade and please do not make it again until you learn more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 09:53:10'] You've got a jumbled mess of positions so it is hard to tell what you have.  Did you open these puts as a put credit spread?  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-spread-option.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-spread-option.asp)  If so, then both legs should have expired OTM for the full profit.  A $0.50 wide spread would have had at most a few cents of credit, so expect this made maybe $2 or $3 profit.  Yes, $2 or $3 dollars not counting any broker fees.  Options take 1 business day to settle so you will see whatever happened by Tuesday (since Monday is a holiday).Worse is you took an amazing high risk letting the spread expire when it was so close to the stock price!  Had the short 392.50 leg been assigned and the $392 long leg expire you could have been forced to buy over $39,000 worth of shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 09:07:09'] You should not be selling options on SPY until you fully understand how options work. You're essentially putting $40000+ at risk on a roulette wheel when you don't know how to 'get paid' on the win. TSLA is an even worse slot machine to play if you're not sure what's going on. Also: yes, you have to manage your positions daily. When you sell options you get your premium up front. If they expire ITM, you will see a *withdrawal* from your account to settle the balance you owe to the owner. You're not making any more than the premium you collected when you write (sell to open) an option position.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 06:07:59'] OH BOY....  First thing; It would be best to read up so you have a basic understanding of options and how they work first.  You can end up in some serious financial and legal trouble if you mess it up. Remember each contract is worth 100 shares. If I were you I would strictly stick to only buying calls or puts at first (after you have a basic/ better understanding of how options work).   I would advise:  Do NOT try to learn about options by selling calls or puts.  Your max loss per put contract sold is 100 times the strike price.  That is what you will be obligated to buy if you are exercised.    If you sell a call contract when you do not own 100 shares of the underlying security, your max loss is unlimited (times 100) per contract.   That being said. Whenever you sell a call or put you want it to finish OTM.  That means you get to keep all of the premium.  That is how you make money by selling either.  There are many times you will not want to hold the contract until expiration.    Regardless when/ if you do sell contracts, be sure to set aside about 30% of that premium from that sale for taxes.  Short term gains always apply to the sale of option contracts.

Worse case scenario, you lose $1.25 (unless you sold or bought the stupidly high price tiers). Please don’t options trade this much money without fully knowing what you’re doing. Good lord, $39,350 is an eye watering amount if you’re unsure how this works. But anyways, you sold the right to sell to you at 393.5. It was over that. You should’ve been able to keep the premium. Buyer wouldn’t exercise at this price. You don’t do anything, on Tuesday the amount in your account should be right. Assuming you really didn’t have anything else going on. I suspect though one or more of your options sold may have been executed. Check the apple put and spy 398 call. I still say you risked too much for such little gains.

You seem to be under the impression that someone takes you out of this trade - yet you didn’t say you’re in a spread . Are you insane ? Here OP is where I think based on your opening comment you are at : You sold a 392 strike that is now 398 - that’s minus 6 bucks x 100 =  negative 600You sold 392.5 strike that is now 398- that’s minus 5.50 bucks x 100= 550.00You are down 1150.00 . Here is the nightmare : if SPY shoots up 15.00 on Monday for whatever reason - add another 3000.00 to your losses. What to do Immediately buy 2 long calls at 398 or wherever it opens ( 399 ,,, 400)  so you have a protective collar to mitigate and hedge future losses if the call goes up . If by the grace of God it goes down , wait for it to go down further than the cost of the two new long call protective collars , that becomes your new break even in this trade . Pray this drops to the ground - then buy to close your two short calls . Sell to close your two long calls and stay the hell out of selling and stay long for a long time .

No you don’t get any money because the stock went up you are selling puts , it’s all about premium that’s you’re maximum gain No one is going to assign you if the SPY is above 393. It’s a crappy stock to play it’s got too much daily IV . You need to buy to close this transaction right before expiration or now when the stock moves up and nobody wants the put . You are in a dangerous game and not too adept at it . I’d call a broker and let them coach through closing this . My advice is the same - don’t sell anything for a long time. Stick to long positions - Suppose there was a binary world event , and the market ticked down Tuesday - a nuclear blast in Ukraine , Chinese invasion of Taiwan both on tap shortly - as a result the market drops 1000 points - your 392 goes to 300 - you have to buy the 300s back for 392 - are you prepared to spend another 20 grand to buy this back? If so can you wait on a long 300 position for it to go back to 392. Do you know how to roll up for more time ? Have more money for that ? What if it keeps going down you need to buy the put back at 200 to 392? Dangerous game young man - if you are staying in this trade , buy a long put protective collar at 375 or 380 to mitigate a downdraft

POST_TEXT: b'Looking for your guys input or advice on selling a naked AAPL PUT for lets say 365 strike at 3.55 EXP July 31 (Current Price 377). If the call exercises, selling covered calls on my now 100 shares to collect premium and pay down margin, or just selling a covered call for a 5 to 10% higher to make sure they hopefully exercise and make around 1k.  Obviously the risk is AAPL tanks and I lose a lot of money, but what are the odds of that happening in the next 4 days?\n\nOf course the goal is to sell the PUT low enough to still collect a premium and have it expire worthless.\n\nIs this a terrible idea for a company like AAPL, with weekly calls? I understand people will probably down vote based on the fact that I see a lot of "Margin is terrible" but even if I own the shares for a bit I\'m pretty bullish on AAPL.\n\nCheers guys, and as always thanks for the feedback.'

I'm trying to close them right now for $1.25, which is also the mid-price of the bid-ask, but I'm not getting filled. \n\nShould I slowly increase my limit closer to the ask side if nothing happens soon, or am I guaranteed to get filled at $1.25 before market close today?

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 08:54:35'] Do not try and close one leg at a time,  You expose yourself to a lot of extra risk.You may need to pay a penny or two over max loss to take the spread off.  If you pay 1.25, the MM won't be able to make any money as he also has transaction costs.  I'm guessing you will be filled at 1.26 or 1.27.  Is it worth it to pay the extra money?  Depends on your exercise costs and the risk of a big after hours move today.  I would pay the extra couple of cents to take it off.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 08:23:26'] I have not found much luck with closing the entire spread like that, ymmv. What I end up doing most of the time is closing one leg at a time (or x contracts within one leg).Another reason you may have trouble closing is buying power, but that is prob not be the case here.

Therefore, you're likely to only buy it from a MM, which means you're not gonna get a good price.Bid/ask spread is pretty wide, partially because of the above.It's so deep ITM that if you were to buy it back, it would be the same as letting your shares get called away and buying 100 shares again.

POST_TEXT: b"Options newbie here. So I know that options straddles exist, so would this idea work? I'm planning next week to buy a OTM call and put on AAPL. I'm expecting a big move in one or the other direction since it's trading at key support at a traditionally volatile time. Apple is at about $132, so let's say I buy the $129 put and $134 call expiring on 12/30. Since a 1% move often correlates with a 2x in an AAPL option expiring that week (at least as I have observed), would it make sense to ride one out and take profit and then just keep holding the other to see if the underlying eventually turns around? If not, then I just take my hedged gain from the successful option. Does this make any sense? Or is theta going to kill me?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:07:37'] It’s a lottery ticket.  You may get lucky, but long straddles/strangles are a losing trade in the long run unless you have some genius level voodoo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:39:50'] For AAPL, I'm doing a $145 calendar spread monthly.  The long leg expires on 12/15/23. My first short expires on 1/27/23.  That's about the pace I want.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:15:58'] You usually need a pretty big move to not get eaten up by theta decay and/or volatility decrease if things consolidate for a bit.I mean it can work but you can also loose on both sides.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:51:39'] Buying OTM would be a long strangle and you need to include the premium in your calculations.The debit paid for both of the legs looks to be about $2.00 so AAPL will need to move down to at least $127 or up to $136 by expiration for these to profit.  Any price between those breakeven points will have theta decay and unless the stock is above or below at expiration the trade will be for a full loss.Can AAPL move this much?  Yes, but keep these prices in mind.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:38:24'] If you're buying an OTM put and call that's a strangle, not a straddle. If you think there's going to be a big move, more than the implied move, just buy the ATM straddle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:57:52'] Horrible (1) a straddle needs high IV movement , the type usually associated with an earnings report . Let’s take Apple at 132. A 135/129 would be too costly and not have the movement up or down to support the cost of premium  for a put and call. A larger wingspan of say 140/124 leaves an 8.00 synthetic where you lose either way . (2) in order for a straddle to be effective the up or down move must surpass the setup cost -if you  have a ten point straddle the stock must go up or down 20 points to break even . Not happening with Apple. More likely with TSLA at the 1/25 earnings report . Get the picture ? Go take the money and get laid - if you’re going to get screwed you may as well get kissed and hugged .
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:22:24'] It would make more sense to realize AAPL is currently Not sitting on support, it’s bouncing on it and in mild decline, meaning at this juncture your idea is just a straddle.  It’ll soon, IMO, rest at 135 and consolidate later at 138-9.  Will it do it this week?  Bear market says no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:14:00'] Hey friend. In your brokerage account, get permissions for spreads and complex. In Schwab that's level 2, some brokerages its level 3. Then, never trade naked. Always with limited risk and limited return. Size your trades so that your max loss is 1- to 3-% of your account, leaning toward 1% at first. So instead of the straddle you propose trade instead a reverse iron condor. Play small, win small, lose small play again tomorrow/ next week. Preserve your capital, keep throwing the stone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:44:10'] Estimated returnsAs at 24th Dec 2022 (AAPL $131.65)Entry cost: $208.00 see detailsMaximum risk: $208.00 (at AAPL$134.00)Breakevens at expiry: $136.08, 126.92&#x200B;You need it to go more than 3% up or more than 4% down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:25:44'] I think you have to admit and come to terms you do not know what will happen. There is no “will happen, always happen, or should happen”. One truth, the mkt will ALWAYS surprise you. Best to manage the risk and entry and setup the best possible scenario. That means finding best chance for overpriced options and sell or offset your debit if you are buying. .02 gl.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:37:28'] This is a strangle and I entered one at market close Friday for the spy as long as one side goes 100% or more you win. Otherwise you have to manage it closely and exit timely. With how volatile the markets have been this strategy works but is more risky than a straddle the benefit with a strangle is it requires less capital
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 18:40:10'] Some notes:* What you're describing is a long strangle, not a straddle. I have done similar trades like this with straddles though. Buy the ATM straddle and see which one goes up, then kill the loser in the hopes of a continuation in the trending direction.* If you jettison one contract in favor of the winning contract, your odds of the stock reversing and you incurring losses on both sides is roughly 1,000%, from my experience. You have to give the trade time to work, and if the stock doesn't move higher, farther, faster, it will just sit there and lose value.Given your inexperience, if you want to do this trade I would suggest doing it in a practice account like TOS's papermoney.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:44:44'] What if I told you that what you think are (key) support or resistance levels, actually aren't?When you accept this, you will have your answer to your stragety.

	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 04:56:46'] (Trying to think creatively here.)If you do not exercise the PUT that you have...That would leave you with 100 shares valued at $170, which leaves you with a paper loss of about $2500. You have 9 days left on the $190 PUT that you own. It looks like you can sell that today for about $2140 or so.That's an extra $140 or so of theta that you could cash out on right now.The cost that you paid for that PUT was covered by the premium from the other PUT that you sold,  correct? So you should have profit from your original transaction. What was your net credit from the original transaction? Does that credit + $140 = $500??If so, then you may be at net -0-.It seems to me that you are better off selling the existing PUT, rather than exercising it. Only because there is still theta priced into it, which you can cash out on.And then selling the shares separately, unless you actually want to keep those. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 05:08:16'] I thought about this scenario today, albeit with 190/200. In this case, it seems like there's a bit of room for tactical maneuvering with either 1) Sell the shares and sell the $190 put to recoup some losses3) Selling some covered calls between $190-$195, waiting for a Hail Mary, and, if it doesn't pass $190 the day before, closing that position immediately before putting the shares at $190
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 06:14:33'] I'd use option 1. There's still time value in your option, so I would unwind the position.Unless you are just okay with holding shares.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 06:21:54'] Sell them all, the long put and the stock.      Your max loss was reduced thanks to the assignment and ability to sell the long put, and the extrinsic value in the credit received on sale opening the position. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 07:51:08'] Close the trade and move on.   Nothing to salvage Edit: I assumed you didn’t want to commit $19k to apple .  Better ways to utilize $19k 
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 11:48:06'] Thanks for all the advice.  What [AutoMattic\_0xB](https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoMattic_0xB) said about defined risk resonated with me.  At the beginning of the trade, I decided the max I was willing to lose.  Why would I change now?  I sold the shares and put for a net loss of $242.  On to the next one.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 05:01:59'] AAPL is a company that for sure will have a rebound and go higher given enough time. If you can hold the stock, then keep selling calls till the stock gets called away. Meanwhile, you're reducing your cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 06:48:59'] You should sell the 190 put and buy back the stock, you will actually end up losing less than the max because this happened, you get about $5 back in the 195 put and about $12 back in the 190. Of course, you now have execution risk on closing the stock and put. Can you submit it as a combined trade with a set price on your brokerage account?
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 08:04:10'] You are already very close to max loss. 1. You can sell Dec 12 190 Call and get $8 premium now.2. You can wait for AAPL to bounce and sell Dec 12 190 call for more premium if favorable conditions occur.
	COMMENT: ['2018-12-12 08:24:53'] Others have already paid out some different choices you can make. It depends on whether you want to own the aapl stock our if you want to cut your losses and move on.The one comment I have is food for thought about future trades.Personally I do not trade options on stock. I only use European style options. These are cash settled and don't have early exercise risk.Right now I am sitting on a sold ps on the SPX (Dec 21 2835/2840)  it was part of an 8 leg position. I took profit on 4 of the legs that more than paid for the "max loss" of the sold ps. (That is what the position is designed to do)This is giving me the opportunity to see if the SPX can move up and let me capture some additional profit with no concerns about early exercise.

POST_TEXT: b"My calendar spread for Apple is 135c for 04SEP and 18SEP. Currently we are at $134.99 and I am planning on closing out the spread for a profit. Reading about calendar spreads I can't find anything about what happens if the short legs are assigned. \n\nDoes it just cancel out your spread or does it give you the profit if it is assigned just as if you were to close it? (Assuming there was profit to be had)\n\nEdit: closed my positions this morning. Max profit before the dip. Thanks again for the responses. Cheers!"
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:54:35'] First of all, no one gives you a profit. You need to follow what's gonna happen exactly to know how much profit you're gonna get.When your short call gets assigned (either at expiry or early, doesn't really matter much in a calendar spread, you should wake up the next day to 100 short shares in AAPL. This is not a big risk since your long call hasn't expired yet and still protecting you, unlike for example vertical spreads at expiration.Now there are mainly two choices you (or your broker on your behalf) can pick to manage this:1. **Close the remaining position by selling the long call and buying back 100 shares of AAPL at market price**. In this case your profit should be the remaining extrinsic value of your long call - the debit you paid to open. Note that if this happened before expiration of the short leg, the profit would be larger than what your position is showing because when you're assigned on the short leg, you got any remaining extrinsic value of that leg for free.2. **Exercise your long call to cover the shares**. In this case you're buying back the shares at $135, and you were assigned at $135. Hence you only lost your debit on the trade. This should be your last choice, since you forfeit any remaining extrinsic value on the long call.You should ask your broker how they handle this situation, most brokers will let you handle it and if your account can't take the 100 share short, you'll be put on a margin call and will be given a few days to resolve it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-10 12:20:35'] 9/25 $20c08/14 $10pAt a ratio of 1:10 calls to puts.The way I see it, a highly volatile meme stock like NIO is unlikely to remain stagnant after an earnings release, however the movement is relatively unpredictable, so therefore I look to strangles in order to profit in either direction. If NIO moons after earnings tomorrow, the September call will gain in value, meanwhile the August put will drop. However, due to time decay and hype, the price of the August put contract is 1/20th of the September call, so I'm able to purchase 20 contracts for the price of one of the Sep calls. I chose to purchase 10 at half the price of one call, because the potential to gain is infinite while the potential loss is finite. If it shoots to $20, I'll lose $50 per 10 puts but gain much more than $50 per 1 call. If NIO tanks after earnings tomorrow, the put will gain in value and the call will rapidly become worthless. However, because the puts were so inexpensive, the percentage gain will carry that little $50 further than the $100 i lose on the call.While I'm limiting my profit potential by hedging my plays against each other, I'm doing so in a manner that limits my losses and almost guarantees a gain, so long as the stock moves. The only way I'll lose my entire investment is if the stock remains stagnant, in which case the puts will expire worthless and the calls will decrease in value the longer I hold due to time decay.I've been burned on plays like this before, by not getting the ratios right (investing equal dollar amounts to calls and puts), buying both contracts with an under 30 day expiry date, etc. so just remember that any strangle is still a bet and does carry the risk of maximum loss, its just a bet on movement itself rather than in one direction or another, which to me is a safer way to play speculative & volatile options.Hope this has been informative, I'm hardly an expert myself.

	COMMENT: ['2019-07-08 08:04:14'] The August call will have more delta than the July call as they are both OTM, but the August one has more time so it will have a little bit more delta (slightly bullish, but mostly negligable). You get biases with calendar spreads when you go deaper ITM because the short option more closely mimics long or short stock, which  results in a higher net delta than the long option.Bias | Spread1 | Spread2---|---|----Bear| OTM Puts | ITM CallsBull | OTM Calls | ITM PutsNeutral| ATM Calls | ATM Puts
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-09 09:07:40'] The reason it's bullish is because you debit into a bullish position. If the stock stayed neutral or bearish, you'd lose. If you wanted a capital efficient way to be bearish, there are other options for you. Similar to a covered call, you don't want the stock to drop, but have a little room for it to drop. The best case is a gradual move upward where the short strike isn't breached.Short term expiry has higher gamma and you can profit from the near-expiry short option losing greater value than the farther long option. Additionally, the increase in IV will benefit you, too. Remember, there are better positions if you're bearish.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-09 10:48:21'] At or near 200, you are delta neutral.  If you move up or down, the delta will change.Positive theta so time will help you and the vega should add to the trade nicely.  Theta swap occurs around 195 or 205 on either side, which is where your greeks will invert.You're using a common tactic for neutral conditions if you expect vol to build. What's your trading plan?

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-21 05:43:47'] Yes, as I understand it, in this case, the options are being split as well, so you can just ride through the split. There may or may not be issues with trading on the day of the split, so if you want to get out around split time, I would do it before.Sometimes when a stock splits, they create a whole new series of options based on the new price and the original series becomes the adjusted series. It can all get very confusing, so I am happy that it is being handled the way it is.

POST_TEXT: b"I need some help understanding if I executed this scenario correctly.\n\nI sold a 177.50/182.50 $AAPL call spread with 5/11/2018 expiration. My short leg was assigned  in the after-hours last night at some point before I got up this morning. At this point, I'm short 100 shares of $AAPL. I called Schwab to exercise the long side to cover that short security, but the rep was offering me a trade to capture some of the remaining premium in the long leg that I'd be losing by exercising before the end of the day. I chose to close out just to avoid issues as it was only roughly $0.35 of premium, and I didn't want to deal with trying to exercise late in the day on the phone with a busy rep.\n\nCan someone explain if there was a better way to handle this scenario?"
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 07:20:15'] The best play is to sell to close the long side and take that plus the cash from the assignment to repay/close the stock position.  As they told you, you're giving up premium if you exercise.The only time you should exercise is if there's no liquidity in the long option.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 06:26:08'] Yes, he could have saved you a few bucks that would have covered the cost of the exercise.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 07:56:16'] I had the exact thing happen to me at a different strike! I ended up setting up a Buy-Write order where I bought back the shares I was short and then sold to close the option i was long. It ended up saving me $0.27 per contract due to the intrinsic value($1.77) of the option being greater than the price difference between the strike price ($187.50) I could exercise and the price of the stock($189). (189-1.77 = 187.23 < 189-1.50= 187.50; 187.50-187.23= $0.27) Schwab was very nice and walked me through the whole thing. The broker told me that the exercise happened yesterday and the alert came out after midnight once the options clearing corporation chose me as a lucky participant. The other party likely exercised to catch the dividend execution. The broker said that I would owe the dividend ($0.73 per share short) later this month. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 07:56:18'] I imagine getting exercised early is usually in your favor as a seller (excluding dividends) unless there's a large move against you overnight between the exercise and come morning when you close the long side.  Chances are the free extrinsic you gain will be in your favor in the long run though.However, AAPL's ex-dividend date is today so this was the risk you took for cutting it close.  Think it's 63 cents per share, so you had to account for that.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 06:32:34'] Usually exercising the long call will be exactly the same P/L as just selling the long call, and covering the short stock. If there is still extrinsic value left on the long call, you would lose money by exercising early. I'm not sure about Schwab's fees but most brokerages have exercise fees so its just better to sell your remaining long position. Just closing out of the position was the best way to handle this scenario. The other option is to just let your long call expire ITM, and it will be automatically exercised at expiration. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 07:56:31'] I’m curious why someone would early assign here.  Would it be bc they want to be able sell today rather than wait the weekend? No dividend to worry about.  Only thing I can think is they saw it basically at its consensus price target and said fuck it, exercise before it drops?Sorry OP, don’t mean to distract from your question, but I find it surprising that would be early assigned.  Am I missing something obvious?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 19:02:51'] The analysis you equated was, because everything is up, it is going to continue to go up. It's been a month, too soon to determine a market trend for 2023 1 month in. I agree price action in Dec - present has been bullish in the sense pull backs are being bid higher versus sold lower. It's too soon to confidently speculate honestly, most people are taking risk off, some adding bearish positions, but most are absolving the positions in a 17-18 VIX environment.Direction is 50/50 - so you could be right - but I see the "analysis" as euphoric/hysteric
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 19:26:29'] These are just speculation and beliefs. What happened to using technical analysis combined with short interest changes... The only thing that move prices up short term is huge buying of shares, or buying to cover shorts position . If short positions are increasing, you'll see nothing but price pressure & consistent fall... This is what happened to Tesla few weeks ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 19:47:21'] Well this is dumb.I think the market is much more solid this year as well....but there are 11 months left and markets rarely just go straight up. You gave yourself no wiggle room for time and we got a shitload of bad news thurs Friday. Still seeing bullish price action but you should at the least be in march or April dated if you want to go long
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 05:49:33'] New bull market lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 18:39:11'] I agree with your sentiment, and I am also playing 2/10 TQQQ calls, but at $27. My analysis suggests a pullback begins well before 2/17. Good luck.
