POST_TEXT: b'Hello folks,\n\n$GOOGL  stock is now in a new dip at around $91.79. I already bought some with avg $96.5. I am planning to hold off for the long term. Is it a good buy now? -  considering the AI and supreme court win.\n\nMy portfolio is mostly tech stocks like AMZN, MSFT, INTC, and GOOGL. But more than 50% is in GOOGL. I was planning to buy some stocks in AAPL too and start investing in ETFs for diversification.\n\nI  just started in early January 2023 with the intention of long-term holding stocks but I would love to hear from you in this volatile market.\n\nThanks!'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:11:27'] I can’t believe they’re so low. I’m long and down 10-20%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 16:15:59'] The entire market has some more pulling back to do
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 14:45:31'] Actually im considering going hard in on GOOGL and AMZN. GOOGL: people saying Bing will take over, its a joke. ChatGPT is great and i have used it a lot, but i have not used google less. Completly different use cases. Google has had insane growth rates over the years, and even if its going to slow down a bit its not going to stop anytime soon because of chatGPT. If anything, ChatGPT will just boost MSFT when they integrate it to office and azure. AMZN: behemoth currently valued below 1T, which in reality should be the valuation of AWS alone. They are catching up and surpassing competitors in so many categories: distribution, advertising, entertainment etc. Im really hoping for a bigger market crash so i can go in hard, but just in case it doesn’t come i have started averaging in both these companies
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:48:14'] Both I think are great buys, but of the two--  which one do you you use more and there isn't a challenger in sight?  I think Amazon.  But with GAMMA I think you can't go wrong over the next 5 to 10 years.  Google, Apple, Master Card, MSFT, and Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:26:32'] Amazon is a great stock to buy and hold for the very long term, even as its short-term prospects feel slightly murky. However, Alphabet is undeniably the better buy today. The digital advertising market may have suffered from poor macroeconomic conditions in 2022, but it's unlikely to be down for long.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 02:50:03'] It's difficult to see how these stocks don't recover long term, I recenlty bought some more but will probably hold off from buying again unless there is bit more of a dip, I don't want to over expose myself too much in 1 stock.But if I hadn't recently bought I would definitely be buying more now at this price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 22:18:52'] Ooof please don’t include intel in that group. Not even the same class of company. I’ve honesty not seen a company fuck themselves over so many times and continue to still get their lunch handed to them. They LOST money on data center this past year and still struggle to compete with AMD.GOOG has a ‘23 FCF yield of ~6.5% at $95/share - math tells me that’s a good long term hold level. You may do math differently though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 16:03:29'] I bought some google today at around 92. Amazon, I'm waiting for a bit more pullback before I enter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:19:43'] Waiting on it to be beaten down just a little bit more before slowly adding to IRA. Been patient so far this year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:59:24'] Just buy the QQQ’s. But wait till NASDAQAnd Spy bottoms a bit more. Cause there is pain to come.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:38:18'] I think it's too early to jump in. Amazon didn't show profitability last year. And google been showing poor earnings recently too
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:09:13'] If you want to buy and hold, why not buy the index, which will weight you heavily in these stocks anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:17:36'] Like AMZN, not a fan of GOOG and haven’t been for some time. Wayyyyyy to dependent on search revenue to make me comfortable, would like to see some diversification before jumping in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:32:03'] Personally invested a decent amount of money from my HSA into just GOOG and AMZN past month, they might go lower for all we know but I think they’re great long term investments
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:17:43'] Amazon is a fantastic stock to invest in and hold for a very long time, despite the fact that its near-term prospects are a little hazy. But today, it's clear that Alphabet is a better investment. Even though the macroeconomic environment for the digital advertising market was not favourable in 2022, this decline is not expected to last very long.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:26:18'] They still have another 15-20% to drop before I’m interested
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:22:50'] 1 ) they are good long term stocks2) but I wouldn’t buy ANYTHING right now. Future doesn’t look clear for a bounce. Let them bleed a little more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:51:20'] No, imo. Not advice
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:56:04'] Just DCA and try to use ETFs instead of individual stocks. Things are red now and everyone’s scared this continues on for awhile… which means it’s better to buy this week than last week. There is no way to be perfect.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 06:50:06'] I honestly think Google has been slipping for a long time. Dud after dud product and their search business is looking like it’s going to be in real trouble after chat gpt takes off. Also they over pay their software engineers by a lot and then have them goof off all day at their offices. Amazon I agree on though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:33:17'] No, they are not good buys. Roughly the top 10 companies change every decade or so. They will remain as companies and slowly grow into blue chip and dividend stocks, but it is unlikely they will ever be growth stocks again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 16:24:49'] [removed]
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:03:43'] I’d say yes. The prices are pret good rn to invest in the long term. I plan to dca into them as the market pulls back here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:08:39'] I like them but I would personally never have any stock taking more than 10% of my portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:21:08'] Held back today. Waiting for another -5% to start adding to my position.  Down about 10% on each position.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:10:19'] Just buy QQQ and VOO and maybe some XLV
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:47:22'] I’ve been doing a few swings with good results eith Google. Bought at 97 and sold at 105.00 I’m actually long in the stock but thought this was a small rally that wasn’t sustainable. I’m planning on reentering at 90
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:03:29'] no one knows. having said that if you want validation I did scoop some up today at \~92ish. if it keeps going down I'll probably just DCA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 22:10:44'] They are great. Unfortunately all my stocks are down so i can't sell them to buy more google
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:04:10'] Nasdaq going back to 12k is a joke considering the current economical context. Im short QQQ.You need to start looking at the FED’s balance sheet. It’s not looking good. Rates up or down it’s become a clear impasse that can only end up with a default or hyperinflation.At the current rate level it’s costing 25bn a week of loss for the treasury … that’s massive in case you’re asking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:08:29'] Yes they are
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:35:54'] Get some shares in ETFs like VTI, VOO, ect. You seem really tech heavy and if one of the FANG tech stocks go down sometimes the other tech follows. If you can stomach that then that is not my place to judge, but I would diversify more into other sectors just in case of a dip. Again it all depends on your own comfort. I am also a little tech heavy, but I’m young and now re-diversifying into more stable etfs over individual stocks.Maybe take a look into QQQ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 00:34:09'] The AI wars will probably shaken the relationship and position in the tech industry quite a bit. Google has the most to loose since it's already the dominant search engine and has the majority of income coming in through ads, a business model which new Ai search engines or chatbots might threaten quite a bit.Microsoft has the most to gain since it has a very diversified income stream and has aligned itself perfectly with OpenGPT, which it will further incorporate into Bing and its other office products. Amazon has large cloud service in its AWS segment, which other companies who develop AI tech will need. So even if retails keeps falling, AWS will continue to hold them up. So I'd put AMZN above Googl. Saying that, nobody really knows and it's all a guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 01:21:08'] I been building my google and Amazon positions steadily. I think the macro conditions will remain bearish for a while it is going to take a long time to get inflation down imo

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:51:54'] Long-term definitely. DCA is good to go, however i do think there is still a room for few% drop in tech sectors for now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:56:02'] No worries about a further drop cos of bing and chatgpt?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 04:57:58'] More to bleed so probably good to be conservative for 6 months maybe. I can see Google going to high 70s as it peaks and valleys down over the next quarter or two. However I do believe it’s a good long term hold as behaviorally it’s too Entrenched with internet behavior and synonymous with search for most. Will it have explosive growth… maybe maybe not but maybe it’s just in a new phase and has evolved into the MSFT DELL INTC level of stability I am Less certain on Amazon. They are about to run out of available workers for their warehouses which will snarl Operations. As inflation continued and unemployment gets larger people will be more cautious with their spend and so the purchasing throughput will also slow down. But in general you are way to overindexed on tech and should consider diversifying even if it’s just at a minimum putting 30% of the port into VTI or VOO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 06:08:01'] Under 100$ I would say is a decent deal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 06:17:47'] The stock market is to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient…. Yes, these multibillion dollar companies (that are continuously growing) are buy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 06:18:34'] P/e is the usually the best and currently Google is a lot better buy than amazon

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 08:16:13'] Just investing on mega cap tech stocks not seems to be a great plan. Try to diversify. take your time to analyse and find mid cap & small cap stocks with potential long term growth.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 08:31:19'] No

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 09:00:01'] I wish i could invest more, but I’m in for two stocks. This feels like a good time to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 09:21:23'] According to the model I use, Assuming growth between 8-10% a year revenue/FCF/profit margin estimates are close, we’re at about fair value now for a 12-16% return.  I sold a put at $88 and would be happy to get assigned.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 10:17:58'] Learned long ago I'm no good at market timing so I go the ole skool route and just dollar cost average. I decided not to buy Tesla in the beginning when they first went to market when I had a good feeling about them and skipped Crypto when it was like $20. So no, don't take advice from me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 11:27:21'] Not yet.  I expect Amazon stock to be around $70 in a year

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 05:46:26'] The good: Revenue +9%, and many numbers moving in the right direction (they’re burning less cash! Yeay!). The bad: Online store +0%, SBC +46%. The ugly: AWS now only +16%, with its first EVER q/q rev decline 😱, and a further atrocious guide (-500bps Q2 to date 😳). YIKES! While EBIT improved +30% on last year (+$1.1bn), TTM EBIT was still flat. They’re also paying more stock, less cash! SBC now $20.6bn trailing 12 months. That’s a LOT of new stock supply to be sold to public investors! As a private company, this wouldn’t be sustainable…

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 07:31:57'] Anybody ever figure out how to factor in the retail growth?  I see new absolutely MASSIVE amazon wearhouses being built all over my state and a new major retailer going out of business every year(bye bye BBBY).  Its got to cost a fortune to install those mega structures and will just improve their revenues in the future.  But unclear how they account for that massive spending they must be doing.  Is it just hidden on the numbers so they dont have to pay taxes?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 16:54:08'] Honestly this will change a lot on AmazonHere in Brazil the three biggest Amazon competition it's gone.  Americanas, magalu and viia it's definitely over this year, the biggest competition now it's a Latam business called MercadoLibre. Everyone is buying now on Amazon and Ml because of this crisis, I think still this year the business of Amazon here in South America will grew a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 07:34:58'] Honest question: Why are they saying basis points instead of percentages?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 08:52:52'] Excellent display of stats. I was wondering why the stock sunk. Key is control cost as the sales side seems to have saturated. Need to be more innovative developing AI, ML based technology while cutting the fat. Outsource shipping more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 10:25:12'] AWS is essentially a barometer for economic activity because their revenue is dependent on customer use. Companies are trying to get through the next year and are trying to tighten the belt on tech spend. I expect this is is only going toast for a few more months and the trend will turn. AWS will be a $100B run rate business by end of next year for sure
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 08:59:50'] aws and azure are really the only cloud services i see large companies use. And where I work we use azure and even with that there are some major cost reduction initiatives mandated because of the economic climate. I wouldnt worry about the decline in aws, it will all pick up eventually

For such an industry leader, revenues will be boosted due to AI implementation and expansion investments made in India. \n\nNot only their shopping platform but the use of Alexa I believe will be in most households within 10 years.

So a way better and upgraded version of the Alexa there is now. \n\nThey just offer endless utility for other things as well such as their super popular streaming service Amazon Video, and their cloud computing services for businesses. \n\nFor such a good price at $118 due to the recent hit they took, Im buying. \n\nAlways love to hear your thoughts and feedback!'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 04:15:06'] Everyone and his uncle is using AI nowadays. Don't get me wrong: Amazon is a great company. But before taking a position on Amazon, I would ask myself, to know if I'm paying a fair price:* Will Amazon benefit more from AI than his competitors? Compared to Microsoft Azure for example (and there are many others)?* Why would most households want to buy Alexa? Many people are fed up with large corporations intruding in their lives. Will most household want to have such a device in their home?* For those who want that, will Alexa really be so superior to alternatives, such as those from Google and Apple?* Will Prime Video benefit more from AI than Netflix, Disney or anyone else in the streaming business?* It seems households will be spending less for consumers goods in the coming months, because of rising interest rates. How will that impact Amazon?* Will AWS growth remain as strong as is has been in the current economic context?* How well will Amazon compete with Alibaba in India?If I had a positive answer for all the questions above, I would go ahead. If not, maybe I would wait to see if the stocks goes back in the 90-100$ range, or commit less money for a position on Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 14:49:17'] As a user of Amazon to buy stuff I find the shift from Amazon selling things to Amazon being a storefront to be a major negative on my user experience. We see in the sales data that Amazon 3rd party seller revenue is up 14% but online stores are down 1%.My Amazon feed is heavily filled with ads on the opening search pages. It's so bad I downloaded a plug-in to eliminate them and it instantly made searching better. And I ditched Amazon Prime because the value just wasn't there.I can't speak for others, but Amazon has definitely reduced the value proposition of their services to me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 23:30:32'] Man, amazon trades like a tech company in low interest rate environment, but it's so capital instensive. I can't wrap my head around it, how is it valued so high when it has extremely high expenses eating into the profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:13:54'] I’m confused, where’s R&D?

So they need to hire more drivers, pickers, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if they raise Prime cost to 19.99 from 14.99 to help offset the costs.

I kept my business also in hope of future value, things are getting better, slightly better. I once had incredible numbers, but those doesn't count, because it was during pandemic.

POST_TEXT: b'## Amazon ($AMZN)\n\nAfter eight years of profitability, Amazon lost money in 2022, weighed down by investments like its 20% stake in the EV maker Rivian, whose value plunged in 2022. Between the punishment doled out by investors over the last year or so and its soaring valuation during the pandemic, theres a lot of noise affecting Amazon shares. After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.\n\nTo deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths arent invincible.\n\nHowever, when we look more closely at Amazons valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 23:34:21'] They are both overvalued vs other retail companies, so I don't view either as a top investment choice right now.  Kroger is a much cheaper e-commerce play if you want to buy a US company investing in delivery and growing their e-commerce capabilities, such as by opening warehouses for online delivery in Florida (where they don't have any retail stores).  International e-commerce options like MercadoLibre are growing faster than Amazon, giving a chance to get in at an earlier stage in their lifecycle.  I'd also look at niche retailers, like sporting goods, that are getting into e-commerce such as Dicks Sporting Goods or Academy Sports.  It is much easier for these niche players to grow revenue by double digits, while Amazon's size is starting to slow down its ability to grow or succeed in new ventures.

If you can select arbitrary start points you can select the slope of perceived gains. It occurred to me because meta is in there and i bought the dip on meta.Meta had this huge covid income surge that swelled it's price followed by a "let's spend billions on vr that nobody wants" (dip) followed by a "thats dumb let's not do that" which resulted in gains. The percentage gain to now can be manipulated a lot by just moving a month or two.  When your list is down to 5 stocks, and one of them is already noted to have that issue, how you selected your start point matters allot to interpretation.Was it selected to maximize the percieved gains of those 5 stocks? If so that is a bias not predictive of future performance.

If equally weighted the big tech performance will be even greater than the performance of the S&P 500. I think investors see big tech as all-weather stocks with enough cash for a recession and as the leading drivers of growth in our country. Some of the valuations are quite high like NVDA and AMZN, which could very well mean that the rest of the market is significant undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:26:31'] A lot of tech company revenue comes from targeted advertising though, right? How is that revenue stream so strong when the S&P500 companies that actually make products are not performing well and consumer spending is overall down? How can tech be so strong if material goods retailers are not doing well?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:37:26'] That's the point of a broad based index like the S&P, it captures all segments.  If tech drops, energy rises.  If energy falls, maybe financials takes it place.  If a company does so poorly that its a burden to the index then it gets dropped.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:07:10'] The thing I don’t like about this is that while most of the big companies have run up it doesn’t really show an accurate picture. This is implying that ALL 493 stocks have done nothing other than the big 7. But look under the hood more, Eli Lilly has run a bunch which means some companies have gone down a bunch. There are several of the 493 that are up 20%, there are plenty of companies that are down 20%+. So it’s just not a great way to look at it in my view. If the chart showed all financial sector together I bet that would show regional banks -50% or however much it would be for their collective shit performance

Going forward tech will be the main driver of GDP gains through increased operational efficiency, and I think we're seeing people allocate investments accordingly. Prices are likely to get ahead of themselves in the short term, but I still think tech is king long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:47:41'] As an AI language model, I cannot directly view or analyze specific graphs or real-time data. However, predicting whether a recession is imminent or not based solely on a single S&P 500 graph is challenging. The S&P 500 index is influenced by various economic factors, [market conditions, and investor sentiment](https://efimarkets.com/), making it difficult to make definitive predictions.    It's important to note that predicting economic cycles and market downturns is a complex task even for experts. Recessionary periods are influenced by a combination of factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, interest rates, geopolitical events, and consumer sentiment, among others.    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the economic outlook, it is advisable to analyze a wide range of indicators, conduct thorough research, and consider expert opinions. This can help provide a more informed perspective on the likelihood of a recession or potential market trends.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 07:44:42'] Amazon's operating performance has declined significantly over the trailing 12 months compared to the prior 3 years. Buying now is hoping that performance can return to 2018-2021 levels and maintain a long term consistency. As a sucker for long term high Return On Equity I avoid stocks like Amazon but I also miss out on a lot of moonshots as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 11:39:47'] maybe at 10 year lows
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 15:54:05'] Yes it is
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 22:15:50'] It’s a mistake to think Amazon is just a website to buy things. To start: they have the most advanced warehousing and logistics system in the world. They are working on last mile delivery robots. .They are working on “just walk out” technology that allows you to scan into a store with biometrics and then take whatever you want. It detects what you’ve taken and charges your card. They are the backbone of most of the internet (AWS). They are working on autonomous driving (Zoox)They are working on satellite based internet (kuiper). They make a ton of tablets, smart speakers, cameras (ring and blink), tv streamers, and wifi mesh systems (eero). They have an entire R&D division called Amazon Lab126.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 15:32:52'] I bought 9 shares of amazon at 100 dollars, now it is worth 81.89 dollars. I still do not sell them and I believe that the price of amazon will rach thel lows ar 65 dollars in the next year. Should I sell my stocks and buy it back when the price reach 65 dollars?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 15:22:47'] Amazon owns the planet. Its stock is finally affordable, its defiantly a buy. Get it while its cheap!  Its the fear.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 20:25:51'] Here is Disney’s problem, they decided against licensing Disney content and decided to do it themselves.  Do instead of getting a royalty check each month they get more but now also get all the costs associated with running a streaming service.  So far they are not doing well.  The space is crowded and other streamers are providing better value to customers.  Unfortunately they also picked a needless fight in FL.  Agree or disagree with Disney’s stance is irrelevant, there Orlando location is a cash cow and they decided to take a stance that aggravated at least some base.  With that said, they have been dropping for awhile due to lagging profits due to poor decisions.  Iger might be able to turn it around, but until we see a quarter or three of sustained growth like they had previously I wouldn’t go to deep on shares.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:57:15'] Do your own research. This is Not financial advice. As someone who works in finance, I learned it's great to get your first $100K-200K in some broad blended stock index fund before being cute and silly with individual stock picks. VOO tracks the S&P 500 so it's great core holding that fits the above mold. Your other stocks are the top holdings within the S&P 500 so all you're doing is concentrating or tilting more towards the current best companies that everyone agrees are the best in this current day and age. Sentiment, fundamentals, and management teams change shifts over time for companies so it's not guaranteed the top companies will stay the top companies.For that reason, investing in something that changes with the times makes rational sense. Index funds periodically rebalance to add winners and losers without you needing to analyze individual companies. That said, my single stock pick gamble at the moment is 140 shares of GOOGL and that comprises 5% of my total portfolio. I like to gamble with maximum of 5% at any given time. The rest of my stock exposure comes primarily from S&P 500 (FXAIX), Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), total international stock index (VXUS).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:57:40'] Diversify from big tech.Take about 10% of your holdings and put it into something smaller cap and riskier. The companies you’re invested in are all mega cap, the biggest of market caps. They are all over a trillion in market cap so you will not see huge gains over a long period of time. Going from 10 billion market cap to one trillion is 10,000% return. Going from 1 trillion to 2 trillion is a 100% return. The higher a companies market cap the less amount of total return you can expect to see going into the future. So your investments are very safe but you are already invested in well established companies that already had their big runs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 18:31:12'] Sell it all. Buy otm call options on mstr that expire 2yrs from now.  Do that after a steep downturn in mstr (probably tomorrow) Sell fewer otm covered calls to offset theta decay AFTER letting mstr swing back up and your portfolio shows gains (10%ish gain). Mstr basically equals btc. Try to get as many year+ otm naked long calls as possible within next 6 months. Mstr probably will be breaking 300 again within next few weeks, if not months. Revisiting ATH is what we're after with next 2 years, that's over 300% roi on the stock alone. Sure you could buy the stock,  but why not go big? I pulled out a loan to do this 6 months ago. Already paid back the loan and I'm up 300% already.Play the theta decay game and you'll go positive during stagnant times. Portfolio will look like a Rollercoaster without having covered calls, BUT each covered call limits your upside potential while softening drops.(After selling covered calls, keep cash as dry powder to buy more otm call options after price drops)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:36:50'] I’d dump AFRM, BABA, Cresco, and RDFN and put most of the proceeds into your VTI position, using the rest to average down on AMZN, DIS, and GOOGL. Better advice would be to dump all your single company stocks, do a lump sum into VTI or 2-3 similar funds with half the proceeds then set the other half to DCA. Add a couple low-fee diversified ETFs if there are 1-2 fields you think might outperform if you need to scratch that itch. I was in a similar situation years ago, and I remember after I rebalanced into safer holdings the feeling that my finances were finally healthy and headed in the right direction waaaaaay outweighed the shitty feeling of taking a loss.Edit: typo

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:38:52'] Homie I hate to break it to you, but your AFRM stock may not last the decade to recover. Their financials are rough at best. Already highly leveraged, have about a year of runway in cash, and are losing money every year, with minimal cash they can raise (especially in this macro environment) without issuing stock. And to top it off their interest their paying is quickly rising.  Edit: If they had a positive macro environment ahead, I'd feel more comfortable holding, but not right now with how leveraged they are, and how high interest rates are
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:09:19'] My non financial advice would be to sell Affirm and Redfin. Baba is a gamble, I have no idea why Disney is such a turd.I have faith you will make money in Google and Amazon long term.No idea what Cresco is.Not financial advice
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 12:09:31'] Personally was in that similar position a while back and all you could do is just average down because 22 was a bad year for stocks, averaging down and picking up cheaper shares will definitely help you regain some as it goes back up and balance out your losses. Remember it's not a loss unless you sell so if you are a long-term investor you'll be fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:52:32'] AFRM is painful to look at - the chart looks exactly how you expect a company going to $0 to look.Your \~$37 entry is hard to figure out. You could have been buying the March '22 shelf after a huge drop, or the retest of that zone.Either way when you buy retests, the retest has to pass to stay in the trade. Otherwise get out immediately.You didn't and found out the hard way. Welcome to paying tuition in the school of investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 16:08:14'] TL;DR about AFRM -- I really don't think it'll ever see $15.50 again let alone $20. But I don't typically short because shorts can become very surprising.But I explain a lot below why I think that. As painful as it is you'd almost be better off just taking all of AFRM and putting it into TLT or something for now. UBT (2x TLT).Not financial advice.But the psychology of "wanting a stock to go back to some price" is punative. It's not rooted in strategy, rationale or pragmatism.That stock hurt you and you want to hurt it back, you want to make \*IT\* specifically pay you back.Even while AAPL ripped 30%+ in that time.Had you just cut your losses on AFRM and put it into AAPL you'd have done better. But you want to punish AFRM for what it did to you.That's the psychology costing you money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 18:23:25'] A very tough decision to make . I will First sell Cresco labs . I will Hold my nose and get out of BABA, Redfin , Affirm and Disney .

I woundnt  chase it or try to get back in or try to buy another stock in hopes to recoup loses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:23:01'] You need more diversity. There are multiple individual stocks and only 1 etf. Although you are diversified with VTI, it's not the largest position in your portfolio. Take a look at investing in the asset classes and I would consider leaving the individual stocks alone for at least a decade if you can stomach it. If you invest in more asset classes, you can weather the storm when different assets classes underperform or over perform.1. Large Cap Growth2. Large Cap Blend3. Large Cap Value4. Midcap 5.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 10:12:34'] U guys need to get off that buy and hold shit. It doesn’t work like that. Look for stocks that are in uptrends and sell them when that uptrend ends. Look at things like market breadth i.e. how healthy the market is. There is a lot more to it than just buying shit and holding onto it forever.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:40:13'] I evaluated your VTI, GOOG, DIS, RDFN entry possibilities.You're prone to buy tops expecting break outs. Start by correcting that mentality. I'd consolidate the worst into cash and wait for some good pull backs on GOOG or something. So sell DIS, RDFN and wait until there's a pull back. RDFN is probably as high as it'll go, if it didn't break out now while AAPL is almost at All time High, it never will.DIS is a turd, but it may stop shjtting itself. I really don't know. I abandoned DIS around $170 for a small loss at the time. Go woke Go broke, look at $BUD. It's imploding as we speak.If I had to bet on a racist slave owner or a transgender, I'd bet on the racist slave owner any day. They know how to make money. I don't care about the morals.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:47:19'] A solid portfolio is one you can hold without having the urge to make drastic changes. So maybe your is not solid yet.I don't understand why people insist on not following the advice from experts, to keep picking individual stocks, and to not diversify the majority of their portfolio. The information is easy to find about our biases, the impossibility of predicting the market, the almost impossible task to pick individual stocks, the emotions attached to long term investment, etc...

You can use trading strategies such as contracts for difference to reduce costs and reduce your current investment. Even if you will lose money in the end, it will not be so serious. After the exit, the decline of technology stocks will basically be stable. At this time, you can choose to buy and hold for a long time

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 19:20:52'] I would watch as many Warren Buffet videos as you can. Don't focus on what he says about what to invest in or how to value, but listen to his reasons for why. This is where you learn what he calls emotional intelligence.What is your reason for purchasing a stock? If the answer is as shallow as, to sell it for more later, then you will always be guessing and hoping your guesses pan out. These stocks could tank, they could go to the moon. For each stock I buy I have a buying statement that I save. I am buying X company because... That statement is my foundation for when and if I sell. I bought Intel at $32 on its way down, because I believe in the capex plan to increase domestic chip manufacturing and pivoting from competing with Nvidia and AMD to competing with Taiwan semiconductor. So, my foundation is no matter what the price does I'm in it until their pivot plan has a chance to succeed. I'll hold until a few years after all their new plants are built and reassess them then. Thinking that way is so much less stressful than panicking over the action of the price from day to day, and wondering if I'm smart or dumb for buying/holding/selling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 10:58:16'] definitely RIVN can go.  Also, put some rules in place so you don't hold onto a loser like this in the future.  If it starts living below the 50 day simple moving average it's time to hit the sell button.  That way you live to buy another ticker.  You have to be brutal and think of every holding like a temporary employee, if it's not performing it's got to go.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:40:06'] Where was this when Amazon was trading at $180, and everyone on CNBC and Wallstreet with their analysis said it was going to $200 ? It’s like those Wallstreet and CNBC guys who said oil was going to $200 a barrel , but we all know where oil is trading at …. Like analysts , they cut price targets when stock prices are falling and upgrade when prices are going up , meanwhile nothing has changed in the fundamentals of the company
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:11:07'] Recall pre-pandemic timeframe AMZN was looking pretty good at prices below $1600/ share. After 20:1 split that’s about $80/ share. With continued strong fundamentals, I imagine a lot of folks looking for buy signals below $80.

I firmly believe that the FAANG stocks aren’t the companies that will lead the market upward during the next leg up. They will be excellent companies to own but just not be the leading stocks. Somewhat similar to what Cisco is now. The beaten down nasdaq stocks I think will propel us higher in the next rally are the high growth equities: Palantir, Snowflake and CrowdStrike just to name a few. Seems far fetched now with the beating that they are taking, but that’s where I would invest once the sell off is over.

And some of those letter choices don't make it easy for creating rhymes to remember them by. I've got no stocks left now if I sell and no money to get  more. All of this was paperless.

I slowly worked my portfolio up to 20k through pretty much nothing but meme stocks. I somehow managed to keep 18k of that then decided to move onto options after seeing the gains posted on WSB. I mostly traded QQQ and spy options until I lost all but 6k. I think I'm done with that community and the brainless casino style investing. I'm trying to put together a stable and not so regarded portfolio. Any help is appreciated this is what I have so far and I also have 2k in t-notes/bonds that mature 6/31. Should I find some more stocks or just put that into what I have going here? Appreciate any help and feel free to insult me I deserve it."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 14:36:40'] I've read your other comments and wanted to pitch in. The index fund is the diversified portfolio my guy. Look up the holdings in any broad market index fund and you'll see they're typically more diversified than you'd ever be in a 15-20 stock portfolio. That's not the point of managing portfolio and picking specific positions. I'm not saying this to be mean but you lack even the most basic knowledge to build and manage a portfolio yourself. The fact that prior to now, your entire trading strategy was based off of stuff you read on of reddit is proof of that. It's your portfolio, it's ultimately your fault if you surrender control and take the advice of randoms on Reddit who may or may not have dropped out of high school -- to be clear, you have no idea. Everyone wants to pull all the knobs and levers so they can convince themselves they're geniuses when they pull anything resembling a profit. There's nothing wrong with ETFs as long as you continually put money into your position. Otherwise you're going to need to do a lot of reading and paper trading for a hot minute. Like a year or more. Don't worry about missing out on opportunities, if you truly know what you are doing it should be easy to replicate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 14:39:05'] Read your other comments and wanted to offer my 2 cents. The index fund is the diversified portfolio my guy. Look up the holdings in any broad market index fund and you'll see they're typically more diversified than you'd ever be in a 15-20 stock portfolio. That's not the point of building a portfolio of stocks. I'm not saying this to be mean but you lack even the most basic knowledge to build and manage a portfolio yourself. The fact that, prior to now, your entire trading strategy was based off of stuff you read on of Reddit is proof of that. Ultimately, it's your portfolio so it's your fault if you listen to some random on Reddit who likely has about as many qualifications as you do.Do you read (actually read) companies' financial statements? Do you look into their competitors to get an idea of the industry as a whole? Do you assess their capital/debt structure? How's their C-suite looking and what is their history and qualifications? Do you know how to read credit ratings? Can you make these assessments in the context of broader market conditions and systemic risk? I could go on, but the point I'm trying to make is that I don't think you'd be making many the trades you've been making if you had been asking these kinds of questions.Everyone wants the feeling of pulling all the knobs and levers so they can convince themselves they're geniuses when they make anything resembling a profit however this often leads to a fallacious lines of thinking. It's how you can give yourself all the credit for building 20k portfolio but then feel completely fine shifting the responsibility for the significant losses you incurred onto some un-named "WSB moron". You are not in control, at all.There's nothing wrong with ETFs as long as you continually put money into them. If that sounds like something you absolutely cannot do (why?), you're going to need to do a gargantuan of reading and stick to paper trading for a hot minute. Like a year or more. Otherwise you're going to be paying for some expensive lessons. There's no way around it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:20:50'] Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Since your portfolio is relatively small, you won’t create much of a tax event by selling everything but VTI (or VOO). If you want to do the dividend thing, then sprinkle some SCHD in there. You won’t be far from the total US market. It’s hard to do much better than that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:52:04'] VOO is SPY. In Each it counts Google two times because of Googl & Goog plus Brk\_B counts two more times.  You also have Google.VTI has 85 pct in SPY slightly more diversified. So you got same stock 4 times. Amz, Adobe, AAPL, MSFT similar content is included.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 18:38:41'] The rest stocks are OK. Make sure the DIS is doing well. Lots of politics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:51:30'] You have a very high amount of overlap between VOO, SPY, and VTI -- four of the top five holdings for these ETFs are AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL, which you also have.The main question you will need to answer is whether you should sell everything else or try to create a more differentiated portfolio by putting more money into V, DIS, ADBE, and/or SCHD.If you would prefer to avoid the headache, leaving your portfolio as is would also be a perfectly reasonable approach.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:53:37'] I suggest VOO and SPY get merged as 1.  Rest are tech heavy except DIS and V.  Suggest add consumer staple for diversification.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:14:17'] I'm more into ETFsI tend to overcomplicate my portfolio but I know when I overlap, it is by choice. Just hope you know your overlaps. If you do, it's fine, it just means you wanted more weight in this or that title. In the end, the biggest allocation should still be the S&P500. I personally believe in more diversification than this on the long term, like international (also emerging markets to a lesser extent). I don't have any ticker to recommend since I buy pretty much everything in CAN$, but an ETF holding the whole world excluding the US would be a good diversification. It also tends to give more dividends than the US market. People tend to say to just invest in the US because of the higher return, but there's a lot of studies on bogleheads showing that adding some international helps the risk reward curve and can even provide a higher total return during flat periods. Between 5 and 20%.Emerging around 5%, no more than 10%.Your tech heavy, and concentrated in Google, Apple, etc... I prefer to buy the Nasdaq100.I also like to increase my exposure to real estate. Avoid ETFs with commercial right now. I don't mind paying fees for active management in real estate.They say to always have some gold, either billions or an ETF if gold producers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 19:32:55'] You can discover nothing about the future of the stock market or any individual stocks by looking at this diagram. If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year. If the PE ratio of the entire market is lower now that it has been in the last 30 years you may want to increase your stock holdings.However, I doubt that that making such adjustments to your portfolio will really help you. It is almost impossible to correctly time the market. I know that these statements will not hold you back. They do not even hold me back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 14:28:08'] Yes indeed.  I was going to buy 1 share lol.. but I think what I will do.. is I will wait for June 6th when they split the stock and its down to around 130 ish as they are projecting..which can still change from now until then.   Even then I am debating I could buy Amazon leaps for 2 years out. I would think they would just appreciate over that time frame.. maybe sell covered calls PMCC once they become stable.  Just a thought.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:11:42'] The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

He didn't pick books because he likes books, he picked books because he saw the largest difference in value to customers was between an online books story and a physical book store compared to all other types of stores (online vs physical). His back story as a quantitative hedge fund guy makes sense, he followed the emerging internet market in an area he thought could provide the most value.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey everyone,  I'm about to go to university and have some money saved up. I'm putting my Retirement savings into ETFs, but with my tax free savings account I really want to hold these Chad companies like Google, apple, Amazon, etc. Long term.\n\nIMO these charts look very extended and I'm wondering if it's a bad time to throw my savings into these companies at all time highs after going parabolic. I know the companies look strong on paper but I wouldn't be surprised at a big market correction eventually. How do you guys feel about starting a position in these companies given these current market conditions?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-05 20:24:48'] the thing is, no one can really tell if they’re overvalued/due for a correction. While yeah they are “overvalued”, but what if it takes years before there is a big correction? you would miss out on all of those gains in hopes for a dip. My advice is to not try to time the market but do cost averaging. Periodically buy shares of the company instead of going all in at once. If it keeps going up you ride the wave, if it dips you can average down. I think that’s the best advice anyone here can give you (actually warren buffets advice, not mine)
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-05 21:05:59'] Possibly overvalued based on current information but these guys continue to surprise to the upside over the long term with new innovations and service offerings. Their cloud offerings are relatively new and have added huge value. Will they enter full steam into health? Or education? Or AI? They may no longer be rockets but I’m still happy to have money there as they’re a good mix of growth and blue chip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-05 22:24:36'] Honestly the best idea is to buy s&p500 index funds and hold forever if you’re serious about investing and want to actually hold long term. The index funds are pretty biased toward tech and bet on everything so you can ride the wave with little effort.

If MSFT has 38 pe, it should grow 19% annually to be justified - just very simple, so today MSFT is priced at being expected to grow 19% annually. The question is if you check their owner earnings (operating cash - maintenance capex) and you use historically accurate and reasonable numbers to predict future annual fcf growth (can it continue this growth?), then you can see what it’s cash flows will be worth in 10 years, discount it back for today and that is the fair value, you would want to buy below that.If you overpay for a fantastic business you will have lackluster returns.

It may be hard to time but I added MSFT on >5% from the high dips in March 2020, July 2020, Oct 2020, Jan 2021, and March 2021. It’s fine to start a position but I prefer waiting for some dips meaning don’t put all your money in at one time. For example if you wanted 5k in MSFT, add in 2.5k and then another 2.5k if it dips. If it keeps going up at least you’re in.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 10:26:16'] I feel like Walmart can compete with Amazon in terms of being able to deliver quickly because of the physical stores. But their website is clunky AF. So until they improve their website, Amazon is still king.

If you think of them only in terms of ecommerce then you are severely underestimating them. Walmart can't compete and I don;t think they want to, they just want to stay afloat.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 13:24:57'] Nobody is splitting consumers down the middle here.On top of everything else Amazon is already doing behind the scenes, they're well on their way to flat out owning the entire logistics side of the business. Once this happens it's game over for everyone else... When you own 'the mail', you own one of the biggest pricing factors in the conversation. And let's not forget what else prime gets you outside of shipping. Walmart doesn't seem to be including an entire streaming platform + music on top of shipping alone.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 16:35:18'] I'm a long time Amazon prime customer but for various reasons I have begun to use them less and less lately to the point I am considering canceling my prime membership.  Except for a few instances where due to the pandemic Amazon were the only ones with the particular item I wanted in stock I've mostly been shopping online with other retailers.   One of and probably the biggest reasons I find myself looking somewhere other than Amazon is they co-mingle their inventory with that of third party sellers and can substitute an item from a third party sellers inventory into your order, if any of those vendors is selling counterfeits it's possible to receive a counterfeit product with your order,( although the chances may be small) I feel like I can no longer trust them to deliver a genuine product 100% of the time.   Another big reason is other brick and mortar retailers like Walmart since that's what op mentioned have begun to catch up by matching their competitors prices also offering fast often free shipping for online orders, and the option for same day pick up at your nearest store making it much easier to shop with them and compete.   I can't speculate on the exact tole this may take on Amazon, but given these options I do see Walmart and other brick & mortar stores being more competitive with Amazon while taking customers away from them.   Just my two cents.

Approx $500-700b of the stock is from the commerce platform. Walmart is $350b without much of an online presence. Coupled with their shopify partnership for 3rd party - don’t be surprised if they capture $100-200b in market cap from AMZN within 2 years.Edit: not to mention Walmart’s physical presence advantage. Amazon may try to parry this by acquiring Macy’s or another retailer.

Also Walmart website is at best, clunky and dated.  Walmart has been trying to be a significant player in e commerce for at least 7-8 years that I'm aware of (although I don't think the majority of consumers are aware of this which speaks volumes for their marketing).  I don't see them ever taking any significant market share from Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 13:49:53'] IMO this is too little, too late, too much $. Amazon started Prime as a way to get 2 day shipping. Now everyone has 2 shipping, but people are accustomed to Prime being part of their spend... oh, plus Prime video. I think people won't leave Prime for this and won't want a second one. Like, sure I can get Amazon music for less than Spotify but I already like Spotify and I don't need/want 2 music services. I don't need/want 2 Primes. Plus, I think there's a segment of WMT's customer base that simply isn't going to pay $98 for this. Source... www.peopleofwalmart.com

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 13:54:26'] Speaking as a non US person, Amazon is a global ecommerce company.No one in Europe or the UK (my country) is going to shop from Walmart online and Walmart here is Asda which already has their own online store which doesn't compare at all to Amazon.I don't see it having much of a dent unless there is a huge response from US citizens.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 14:04:52'] Let’s see how Amazon stock fares as competition heats up. Though retail doesn’t contribute to Amazons bottomline, competition will make Amazon bleed in this segment. AWS already has stiff competition over the next decade on many fronts

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 14:49:09'] For people already using Amazon, what incentive would they have to switch? This is no better than Prime, but without a huge media library and other perks. Most of this seems like things Walmart already does, just with an annual fee.  Amazon also has plenty of room to respond. Especially given how profitable their other businesses are. They could relatively easily cut the fee for Prime without a major hit to the bottom line. This feels a little to me like when Blockbuster went into DVD delivery. It was a competitive service, but it lacked any good motivator for people to change. I don't think Walmart is going the way of Blockbuster anytime soon, but at the same time I don't think this is going to take a lot away from Amazon.Though this likely will convert more of their existing base into less costly online shoppers. Like with Prime, many people who sign up won't use it enough to be worth it.

Amazon also offers a larger variety of goods I can purchase. Walmart is beneficial to me only in the sense that if I need something ASAP, I can run down to my local one to grab it. Also, I usually only go to Walmart for consumer goods that I always need to replenish after they run out like conditioner, razors, shampoo, toothpaste, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 15:37:14'] I think the fact that Walmart already has the locations in place and within drone distance of everyone's house, they'll win.Could be wrong but I bought calls this morning at the announcement. Will probably buy more tomorrow as the news digests.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 17:18:51'] The only way I see Walmart splitting eCommerce in half with Amazon is if Amazon has massive supply shortages that Walmart is able to fulfill.  Or if Walmart can offer the same products for much cheaper, the only thing there is the consumer needs to be aware of these cheaper prices somehow.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 17:31:08'] Amazon prime membership is well priced. Not only does it come with shipping, but it also ties in with all of the company’s other additional offerings Eg Audibles, Amazon Movie Streaming service, Twitch Stream, etc. Amazon also hires contractors for 1/2 day deliveries. Unless Walmart prices their “+” much cheaply than Amazon, there are obvious reasons why one would go with Amazon than not. Also, Walmart doesnt have nearly that many items to offer “ecommerce” wise than amazon. Anything you find on Walmart can be found on amazon, and if not, an alternative can be found. The same cannot be said the other way around. That said- why would anyone want a continuous Walmart+ subscription when they barely have a reason to go in first place? Walmart’s move to ecommerce is 5 years too late, unless the provide smth else thats innovative with their + introduction.

However Amazon real money spinner is AWS and it is the subsidiary which essentially bankrolled the purchase of Whole Foods for 14B. The e-commerce market is very competitive in USA already and Amazon is actually making an operating loss on the e-commerce business.Amazon Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh is already behind Walmart already. Walmart has bascially won the fight for groceries and by extention online grocery services. Walmart is already the 2nd biggest online retailer and given its vast brick and mortar business which is still large Walmart can scale their operations as quickly as Amazon in e-commerce.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 20:45:47'] Walmart has shitty customer service Amazon has supreme customer service
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 20:58:41'] Walmart has been so slow to embrace e-commerce in anyway that meaningfully competes with Amazon. Only in the last few years since the Jet acqui-hire have they seemed to take it seriously. They are also going to have a lot of trouble getting to same day and 1 hour delivery. Amazon is investing billions into its own planes, vans, trailer trucks, etc. they are in every neighborhood daily or multiple times a day. Walmart isn’t going to be able to compete with that because fedex and ups can’t match that which is why amazon built its own deliver network. Walmart has retail locations but those locations have to still spend 95 percent of their square feet being crappy places to shop. But the biggest reason Walmart isn’t going to be able compete with Amazon is because Walmart needs to fund e-commerce with profits from regular retail which their shareholders are not thrilled by. Amazon on the other hand funds e-commerce with the profits from AWS which it’s shareholders celebrate. Walmart will be fine because the rest of retail is collapsing and they are positioned to take advantage of that but I don’t see them keeping up with Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 23:15:58'] Gonna go against the grain here. I think this is a game changer for Walmart. I pay the $98 per year just for Walmart's grocery delivery service. Haven't gone to the store all year. Well worth it to me, considering that Amazon's grocery is so overpriced because it's from Whole Foods. A gallon of Milk is literally $6 from Amazon grocery. At Walmart it's under $2. Also, it's great having same day delivery. The selection isn't as vast, but for common household essentials, Walmart is my go-to now. Whenever I need something, I just add it to the cart in my Walmart app and place the order when I hit the minimum for delivery. They're also pushing Sam's Club heavily lately, and I canceled my Costco membership in favor of that too. I actually prefer Sam's Club too. More variety and better value. I bought a shitton of $135 August calls when I saw this news pop up. Between the parking lot drive in movie theaters, Shopify integration, and now Walmart+, I think the Walmart 5 years from now will be a vastly different and modern company. They're innovating at an astonishing rate.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 23:58:49'] Their last earnings report, even before Covid 19 saw them right there with Amazon with their e-commerce. Their website and distribution is just as capable, and I see Walmart+ being a great success. The only thing that I can see maybe standing in their way is the fleet, but I imagine with all the Walmart owned semi trucks, that they can easily hire and maintain small trucks and crews as well. Should be interesting, and could even spell more jobs which of course will equal a healthy stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 04:31:40'] Search on Walmart's website is so bad that I can't find what I am looking for.So I am not interested.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 04:38:57'] AMZN has competition for everything but shopping.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 05:27:13'] Man... A lot of bitter people in denial here that bought overpriced Amazon stock...RIP
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 05:54:29'] They’ll charge people monthly to deliver worse products slower using subpar delivery services and a notoriously bad customer service department.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 06:52:16'] The profit engine for $AMZN is AWS. Margins are very low on retail. Ads are becoming a larger part of revenue. I order from $COST and $TGT and my items are here in 2-days or less now for the most part. Amazon's delivery advantage is eroding in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 07:08:06'] Short answer is no. Mainly because their catalog isn’t growing and their business is in being a mart, not e-mart. Not once in the last 10years has Walmart had ANYTHING worth creating an account that I didn’t just buy from amazon or other online retailer. Now with plague and right-wing nut jobs, no brick and mortar is safe. Not only that, shopping isn’t fun anymore. It’s dangerous.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 07:38:04'] As much as I disdain WMT. This is good for AMZN now it gives them a faster approach to world domination
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 08:08:47'] S Z,!!
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 08:34:06'] I doubt itll make a big difference. I saw that Walmart offered a similar 2-day shipping last year, but on like 0.1% of the products that Amazon does. If people are gonna have to chose between an AMZN prime sub or Walmart+, theyll most likely pick Amazon. More products, also includes Video streaming, probably other stuff that i dont know about. I really only see them taking market share in urban areas where people have more discretionary income and can afford 2 subscriptions. Maybe years down the line theyll start taking up more share, but Amazon is constantly working to improve their experience as well. Disclaimer: i work for Amazon
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 08:55:16'] Even from the picture you can tell Amazon is still on top. The tape and crushed box show sloppy work and amazon rarely ever has that.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 09:02:11'] Great. One monopoly is now another monopolies competition. What do we call this new economic system we have replaced capitalism with?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 09:58:40'] I won't switch especially for Walmart. In my mind they represent lesser quality. Also, I browsed their website recently and it wasn't a pleasant experience.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 12:33:56'] I started selling stuff on the Letgo app, so yeah, I’d say their days are numbered.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 14:10:34'] The real reason this isn't gonna do shit to Amazon is Walmart's brand image. When you think of Amazon, you immediately think of efficiency, class, technology, forward thinking, mass surveillance of minorities, etc. When you think of Walmart, you bring to mind images of Meth, Obesity, Iowa. Nobody shops in Iowa. Nobody will buy from W+
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 14:10:57'] I would rather buy razors from Walmart than the fakes ones in Amazon. Actually a lot of other products too
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 15:05:33'] Walmart sucks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 15:06:57'] Does Walmart have video, music and books? Oh didn’t think so..
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 13:10:22'] People should actively try to damage Amazons business in favor of businesses run by people favourable towards the human race. Those with a demonic god complex often appear to be charitable but you have to question their true morality of beyond their apparent goodwill.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-07 11:12:00'] Walmart is strictly american is it not? And amazon is a global delivery service so I see them being in a completely different ball game.

DCA is a fair way to invest long term. but remember to take profits... today was the 2nd time I had to stop loss in the last 3 years because I wasn't paying enough attention and found out late they were liquidating or filing chapter 11, which leads to 2) don't get into more positions than you are ok to track, and keep up with the news otherwise you are holding for the sake of holding. if you're doing that just get the indexes... literally I do that on a monthly basis to avoid the extra research 3) look at the 5yr and 10yr...we are at levels now that we're seen back then in many places, so we are hitting a cycle, but the fed and govt are doing some shady stuff too so who knows what will happen.nutshell a) don't invest what you cannot afford to lose B) make sure you are ok with the choices to act, don't act, or do something else.

And happens on multiple stocks. This is some sort of derivative or something. Nobody can figure it out because data is being skewed and withheld (cftc). Our markets in absolute shambles right now regulatory wise/abuse wise.Just like the NYSE 'glitch' the other day at open. They left the dang Disaster Recovery system on. That's not a mistake. It's never happened. And suddenly, t-2 from Jan 20th Swaps rollover we get some insane market 'glitch'. If you were smart, you'd have bought options and banked instantly in all that stuff that tanked.APs and MMs submit orders that are place on the opening bell the first second via a matching system which determines the opening price of stocks. Then of course they manipulate trades premarket on low volume to shake out weak investors.They are even using the glitch as an excuse to stop the SEC from switching from Payment for Order Flow to the new Auctioning system in March.TLDR: certain market participant manipulating and using it against the sec decision to change PFOF in March.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/nyse-glitch-caught-up-in-fight-over-sec-rewrite-of-trading-rules

What type of products they makes or what service they present. and is there a demand on the products or the service's. is the business makes a profit and is there a demand on the products or the service's. then you go through the financial statements and do basic financial analysing to see is the company keep growing and makes profit or otherwise. This is how you do it if you really want to  make money and build your wealth and do it like i did. other then that is just a waste of money and time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 05:24:07'] Three possible reasons I would consider the same right off the back:1. It's expected that the Biden administration will not be as forwarding of tech as during the time Trump was in office, thus the high profitable tech era may slow down.2. The positive outlook on the end of Covid and lockdowns due to the recent announcements in vaccine trials and related...3. The flow of stock market money away from tech stocks into other industries and away from those currently overvalued/priced tech companies.If you wanna buy low and sell high, well it's the time to sell after a long bull run on tech and buy what is currently cheap as a result of the pandemic. It's a gamble that may pop y off.For those quoting the past disastrous performance (portafolio value down from $17.52B to $12.92B), SoftBank just learned a $4.5B lesson. Having worked in corporate settings, I can suspect that they have adjusted their strategies and dumped the previously not working one.

POST_TEXT: b'\n\nAfter the splits in June will own about 700 shares of GOOG, 800 of AMZN and 600 of NVDA (not splitting). My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan. \n\n\nWhat are potential downfalls to this strategy? I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each. If the price falls thats ok I still own the premium. Best case is that it missed the strike by $1, I keep the premium and the long position gains. \n\nThanks for any advice!'
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 18:52:09'] The only negative is you loose out on upside. At 15-20% your premiums are pretty small…well small compared to the investment. Since you have millions invested the actual cash value is good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:26:28'] Solid plan.  I wouldn't limit it to 1 CC in total.  1 per 100 shares.  Just stagger them so you never have all of them exp on the same date.  Sell on big green days and always leave a couple close to exp and some un covered so you have a couple to sell when they are way up.  Buy back CC on down days.  I frequently set a trailing stoploss on my CC once they hit 50% profit at like 10 to 20% of the remaining value to account for volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:34:19'] Great plan; I hope it works for you 😎

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 06:46:09'] Nah...  I think we will be range bound/sideways from here for a while.  I doubt we make new lows unless unemployment starts rising.  We won't make new highs until the macroeconomic situations improve (inflation subsiding, FED cutting, economy growing at a higher rate).  This will probably a long way off though. The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse.  Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed.  You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them. Catalysts:Small FED rate hikesSlowing but not contracting economy Slowing inflationLow unemploymentEarnings falling but not as much as feared. Bond market still pricing in rate pauses and cuts in the medium term 12-24 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 03:45:23'] Being in the data warehousing industry for 25 years, I can say Snowflake offers a lot of easy, quick benefits for 'some' specific applications; however, this is not the save-all system that people are thinking it is.  Its faults are starting to become apparent with a handful of customers becoming much more vocal about the product. I will not be a buyer of this product at this price point, that's not saying it won't go up, it's saying I have low expectations over the next 5 years based on my industry experience.

It all depends on your individual risk tolerance, what is in your current portfolio, and the time frame and goals you have set for your portfolio.Any stock advice without taking into account your personal situation is just sales talk.

POST_TEXT: b" The stock market rally had another sideways week, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all drifting lower in continued tight action. Investors await a flood of earnings headlined by **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and Google parent **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**). \n\n \n\nBuying opportunities haven't been plentiful, and many have fizzled or failed.Earnings season will hit full force in the coming week, offering the potential for the market rally to break out of its rut.\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Meta and Google are especially important. Microsoft and, arguably, Amazon stock are actionable now. Google stock is close to a buy point while Facebook parent Meta is pulling back after a massive run.\n\nBy themselves, they have a big impact on the major indexes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 04:32:42'] Honest question: do premarket trends and futures accurately predict the trend after the opening bell? Based solely on my observations, it seems like there is no real correlation between pre-market trends and the action during the trading day. But media outlets always talk about whether the indexes are up or down before open.

Doesn’t matter how much you gained or lost, if you’ve come to the conclusion it is overvalued then you sell. Do this for all the stocks you own, don’t have a weight of more than 10% for each position. After you did that then make a list of other stocks and evaluate their fair value. When it reaches at least 25% below the fair value then you buy it, otherwise just sit on your cashIf that seems like too much work for you or you don’t think you can handle the stress of watching your positions drop, then sell all your stocks and buy VTI, there’s no shame in it and you’ll probably do better than buying individual stocks while also saving time The worst thing you can do is to just HODL, especially if you have no idea on the financial health of the company and the risks associated with each position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 10:25:35'] Evaluate whether these stocks  will be able to rebound in these market conditions. Markets want net income and future outlook positive companies. If your research shows they can rebound I would hold because it will most likely be hard for you to trade those gains back. Otherwise sell and move on or sell half and move on. It looks like you risked a lot more on some stocks over others so it seems your risk management is off. Never load the boat on one stock. Always have a plan for up and downs so in this case with nvax say a 30% dip you sell. What do the candlestick charts show? do they show potential bottom? buy signal? more downside? what about the news on the stock? The stock needs to convince you of why you should hold it. if you cant find good resons sell. or sell half to mitigate potential more downside or possible rebound. Loses are the only way you truly learn. Your paying yourself a education. But if you dont have passion for trading...longterm investing will be better for you and then you can focus on something different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 10:33:41'] If you were going with nvax you might as well swap that out for something more exciting like a promising company using shrooms to develope medication that helps treat/cure depression. Lot of potential and almost more feasible than nvax doing anything.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 11:16:03'] Hey there, consider to close your positions and spot some companies that have potential upsize. 1. You have to cut loss for NVAX, and all the penny stock that are of no potential growth unless you want to trade it but looking at the loss you probably can’t get over it due to emotion when you are losing.2. You have to be mentally strong and discipline to make the cut. Learn to close your position and start switching to potential stock that will give you profit in 2023. Forget about 2022.3. If you are here and reading this, close off NVAX and FUN. We are in post pandemic and NVAX is not going to climb back up and if you are going to invest in FUN. I rather you look into RCL. They have potential to get into $100 as soon as 2023Q2.4. It’s good that you’re honest about your losses prolly because no one know you here. That’s the first step to profitable. Remember to look into the time period you going to trade/invest— more important know your risk appetite. 5. Message me if you need more help to adjust your portfolio. I’m more than willing to help.6.

That isn't going to be an easy decision or even an easy process to figure out.You're going to need the research quite heavily to determine your next step, but most importantly take time to really think about your actions before you do anything. No matter what you do, panicking is only going to make the situation worse.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 12:06:42'] The best advice ive seen is:Throw money into something like VOO, auto reinvest dividends and stop trying to pick individual stocks (or at least treat it like gambling and only use a very small % of your acc for individual stocks).With that out of the way:NVAX has earnings tomorrow. Its just been going down. I would probably try to see if I can offload on someone during a pre-earnings/pre-open price spike or something if one happens.But if you think the company can rebound in a few years and can push out some amazing 'products' in the future, then you may want to hold onto it. Either way the choice is yours, neither is a sure thing and its up to you to decide.

If you are unhappy with your investment or think it has a limited chance to recover, than sell. Buy something a bit more solid, now is a great time to buy long term investments.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 14:27:15'] Right now at least hold for another few months. Historically split gov does best for most assets, so far it seems like gop wins house and perhaps dems keep senate. So just hold for another few months as the market sentiment likely improves a bit. Also seems like more and more companies acknowledges that they have to start cutting costs aggressively, so that could help a igniting a small rebound as well. Id say it’s almost impossible for many to hit all time highs, but a swift and small rally is likely for the next few months. Another thing is that crypto likely does best in split gov, biggest fears on crypto is more regulations.  For  stocks though, biggest fear is more US inflation. Sentiment for crypto is high across the globe, places like Vietnam actually has lower inflation numbers. As for India, while their inflation is even higher than US, their gdp growth is in double digits. People in those places really love owning more crypto. From the inflation estimates, seems like US inflation will continue to be high which will put pressure on stocks again after any midterm in the midweek.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:04:07'] The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don’t understand what’s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn’t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don’t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.       This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out.

What is your new thesis for why it will not just work out, but work out even better than your original plan? Why else would you throw more money at it now? Is it really the best opportunity you can think of for investing new cash currently? When AMZN does turn around you will still have plenty of time on the way back  up to add to your position.

Stocks are a long term game and as they are down now… they’ll be back up. Don’t get mad and blame the fed for doing it’s job. People commenting on here seem delusioned that stocks will always go up and the fed is some terrible government entity to make people lose money. They have literally been saying for the past year we have to tame inflation and raise rates. You can hear the recordings on YouTube. See the meeting minutes on government websites, and go look at the news.. it’s not some evil scheme

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 00:13:17'] It's ridiculous and hypocritical that all these narcissistic dweebs took advantage of the Robinhood platform to invest in crypto, Dogecoin, and meme stocks and then got all salty when they halted trading which is exactly what all these crypto platforms do constantly, many of which are going bankrupt before Robinhood. Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place. The stock market literally doubled in less than 2 years. It would be a complete policy error mistake to not scale that delusional overvalued BS down a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 11:51:09'] You can thank the republicans for giving a massive tax break that went into effect right before a global pandemic. This caused the government to have to issue massive amounts of paper which led to very high inflation. The tax break would have caused inflation, but the pandemic exacerbated it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 13:58:58'] IMHO- it would better serve Powell and Biden both to just come out to the public and say, “it may get pretty bad in the next year or so from the things we are seeing in the market. Don’t freak out, prepare, save your money and invest in reliable companies and we will get through it”. But that would require them to be responsible and honest

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 15:49:53'] Ooof this is hard to look at.  Not so much that it pisses me off, more cringe that you are flaunting your juvenile portfolio like it’s an own to indexers.  Seems like you are new, we all had portfolios that have looked like this at some point which is why it is cute to look back on now.I don’t think you need to go full passive index but for Christ sake load up on an index and make really specific choices for anything else you will buy and only hold a few you follow closely.  Seems like you have just bought every name that retail has piled into at different points throughout the past 3 years, assuming for poor entry prices.Edit: your selection is actually not that bad, I would focus more on concentration if you really want to outperform the index.  It will force you to make higher conviction choices too.I think you won’t see the hidden expense that comes from cognitive/emotional biases.  There is also a cost on the time it takes to manage your positions, not sure that a $100 in tractor supply and lululemon are worth it.  Purge that Roth and pick 5 highest conviction names imo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 09:28:35'] No, you won't piss off the bogleheads. They will be living their life and accomplishing their goals with a simple 3 fund portfolio that virtually requires no time to maintain their diversified investments. Some people don't care to "tinker" with their investments in the pursuit of chasing higher returns, which the evidence shows that it is in exercise in futility for most investors.

Keep in mind that without leverage of some sort you’re not going to be creating wealth much faster even if your picks do pan out.

POST_TEXT: b"https://www.yahoo.com/news/amazons-highly-paid-tech-workers-225300345.html\n\nSome Amazon tech workers say they are ashamed of the working conditions of the company's warehouse workers.\n\nThe tech workers are openly sharing words of encouragement to those warehouse employees, who are planning on a short strike during Amazon Prime Day.\n\nThe striking workers want better pay, more reasonable work expectations, and better chances for advancement.\n\nAmazon says it already provides all of this to them.\n\nHowever, warehouse workers tell a different side of the story: They talk about the constant pressure to perform and how the company's automated systems track them, and can even automatically target them to get fired."

	COMMENT: ['2019-07-13 06:26:14'] They'll be automated soon anyway. Won't be anything to complain about at that point
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-13 06:47:26'] Of course it's easy to sympathize when your working from home typing away, and making six figures. But most folks who've never done real hard labor (construction, warehousing, farming , logging,etc) don't understand the physicallity of it. Most folks in those warehouses are not the.most fit, now add standing on your feet 8hrs to someone who was a couch patatoe, and you got issues.But the real problem isnt just the work it's the incessant nature of the metrics that are constantly monitored by Amazon and the incentives the managers have to keep the worker bees moving.  Sorry to say it, probably 90% of the two delivery orders can really be 3 or 4 days I'd prefer a slower pace for the warehouse staff, I can wait an extra day or two for my cheap Chinese tchotkies.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-13 20:11:03'] Spent four years working nights at Amazon.  While experiences may vary from building to building, it's a good company that takes care of it's people.

	COMMENT: ['2019-07-13 06:47:34'] Keep complaining and you won’t have a job.  I️ can’t imagine warehouse conditions are great anywhere.  It’s a low level job that requires little to no skill.  If AMZN I’d really working on Drone ships, you don’t think they automate warehouse production?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 18:10:46'] If you plan to hold then you may want to consider selling covered calls against ur position. I’m sure someone else has mentioned this but I didn’t see it in this thread. When you sell calls against your position you collect premium while you wait for your position to improve. If you buy 15 more shares of PYPL you will be at 500 shares and can sell 5 contracts. The at the money Jan ‘24 contracts are selling for $1680 each. Those 5 contracts will pay you $8400 just to wait it out. You can do the same with your AMZN shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 19:41:45'] Do you have any gains elsewhere? If so, sell before Dec 31 and harvest those losses. If not, you can write off up to $3k of total losses for the year against your income. So sell enough to do that. The rest of any losses will carryover to offset future gains. If you sell to harvest losses, just remember to wait 31 days before buying the same stocks to prevent  a wash sale. What’s your time horizon and goal? If it’s 3+ years out I would suggest cutting your losses and reinvesting in a broadly diversified etf like VTI.

Even if they could fix the courts in their favor, they wouldn't be able to afford insurance on their buildings. It's a society breaker. What is wrong with you that you are holding this garbage. Do you enjoy the self hate and rage that you get from failure? You needs to understand that the power and confidence winning feels so much better. If you can't win at this then find something else to win at, but take your loss porn to that other sub, they will be happy to drink your tears with you.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 23:51:34'] Make a wash sale, and reinvest into and continue to dollar cost average into an ETF like VOO and VTI or JEPI. Stop picking individual stocks; the data is against the long-term success of such a strategy; you’ll be screwed in a beer market, significantly, when the stocks are overvalued. Just continue to dollar cost average into an ETF in 15 to 10 years. Those growths will compound, especially if you time the market and continue to invest heavily during a recession. Be patient and invest with a plan. You will be fine just learn from the experience.

Zero reason for this to go up Saudi Arabia and Russia cutting gas in oil to the United States oil stopping their reserves at the end of the month inflation I can almost guarantee is going up a little bit I mean absolutely ridiculous. I will say that for whatever it is worth looking at the 2008 charts it lines up perfectly along with the rumblings of Central and investment banks beginning to crack and fail.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 05:14:32'] Bear Market timing is what is wrong
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:23:50'] I wouldn’t take specific advice from anybody on here.  Really from anybody anywhere.  Nobody knows when the market will enter a bull phase or how stock a vs stock b will do.  This is why experts tell us amateurs to invest in index funds.  We don’t have the data or time to do individual stock investing.  It’s a game where you are trying to outsmart other people who are smarter and have more time and experience than you.  So you are gambling to get lucky.   Diversify and play the long game.  It’s the only thing that works for individual investors over the long term (unless you have insider info).  Don’t try and time the market, but instead invest more during down periods to cost average down.  The market always trends up over long time horizon.  Lastly, everybody thinks they are a genius when they are doing well, which is very common during bull markets (last 12-13years).  So most of the advice you’ll get is from “kids” who haven’t been through multiple cycles.  Those older people like myself have and know better.  Good luck and don’t be stupid/greedy/impatient/emotional or else you will lose.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 01:27:43'] How beyond meat Make money? 🙈 There’s no answer lmao
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:22:10'] Classic the only stock making money you have only 1 share of.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 03:10:46'] you picked too many risky stocks, if I were you I would only hold amazon, alibaba, paypal, warner brothers and at&t and use the money you used for other stocks to average down on these companies, since these are the least risky of the stocks you hold given the history of the companies and their size. I myself currently only hold 2 stocks right now, both have market caps in hundreds of billions, loads of cash on their bank accounts and I still keep half of my money I plan to invest to average down my positions in these two companies depending on the progress of the recession in 2023, when the companies could get even cheaper.buying stocks is not for everyone, it takes years to learn how to tolerate risks, so you may want to start with safe ETFs following the main indexes for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:22:20'] I can spot what you're doing wrong right away. You don't make valuations for the stocks you buy and if you don't intend to do so you really should look at ETFs instead.Also you seem to have been tricked in to high flying stocks and ark for some reason. Even the best gets tricked ones or twice, the differense is admitting to yourself you've been duped and move on.Also looks like (haven't made a deep dive) that beyond meat only loves one thing and that is torching cash, if they burn the cash they have on hand now there's little to no chance they'll get refinanced in a market like this. I'd dump that crap right away.ARK funds shouldn't be invested in because that woman haven't had a good idea since she was born and that's honestly taking it easy on her. Dump that crap and buy s&p 500 etf instead.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:54:49'] Your companies are not bad, you even have great companies I would say. It only seems you bought at the height of a bull swing. I don’t want to give you advice, as I am not qualified for that, but what I would personally do in a situation like that, considering that your portfolio has great companies, is wait it out. I would continue to add to my portfolio during the coming months, as many experts believe we will enter a bear market. You could use a sort of dollar cost averaging strategy. Again, seek advice from a professional.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 07:27:35'] You have like $20k? You shouldn't have more than 1 or 2 positions to be honest, because having a position means you're following a company and it's not a good use of time to track a company for just a few hundred bucks or a couple of shares.Do an index ETF as your primary position and then have small positions in 1 or 2 companies you like enough to go thru hell and high water with more for fun and to stay interested. Remember investing is not so much a matter of hitting home runs, but actually it's about avoiding striking outs and pop ups.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 08:14:53'] Beyond meat Not terrible? A company that states it is a purely nutritious product when it’s contrarily shit food. Besides that though just bad timing. Market is bearish and probably will stay bearish
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:07:01'] If you can give an example of how a palantir product is used, I’ll give you an award. If not, you deserve to lose money on the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 17:19:28'] I'll pick one to comment on and abstain from the vote on the rest - I think BABA can come back up - by a fair amount even if it takes many years to retake the ATH.  The COVID restrictions have reduced economic activity in China.  When they finally admit they are being dumb and let people live a mobile life with full COVID risk, a big weight will be lifted.  BABA should ride that in a good way.  It is a VIE that is really only a tracking investment vehicle and not actually a stock, but it is what is available so I think it is not bad to hold on to.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 17:35:52'] There's some green in there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 04:55:11'] The difference between you and the other post like this is the sheer value of the investment. The other post was at $120,000 originally and was down 80%. This looks like $15,000? And you’re down 34%. I would sell your biggest losers, especially PLTR. PLTR is a stupid meme stock. It’s been around for 20+ years and has yet to turn a profit. The subreddit the tracks it is a GME like subreddit echo chamber that manipulates data and information to make it seem like very soon it’s going to blow up. These meme stocks and there subreddits are dangerous because they grossly exaggerate all types of news to make it seem really good and have managed to trick a lot of people. The people become bag holders and also become a cog in the system furthering the manipulation of data.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 01:43:14'] You need to immediately get rid of MTZ and NETI, these  2 laggards do not belong in your portfolio.  Apart from that it's top notch.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 04:04:42'] It would reduce PYPL and pltr. I would sell T, WBD, BYND, ARK and move it into BABA. (I have a 110 target on baba for the interim) Then I would double down on Amazon. Lowest it’s been in years. I don’t think being down 34% is too bad. You would be down just the same if you bought the nasdaq.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:58:32'] Your mindset is likely closer to trading than it is to investing. I’ve found this to be the most common issue these days because of these “investing, stock market” subreddits and the type of advice people give each other regarding stock picks. Trading is NOT the same thing as investing. I do both, they have different rules and timeframes.Given your poor performance on the year, don’t feel bad it’s a brutal bear market that has crushed most stock pickers, I would encourage you to reevaluate your selection criteria, consider diversifying more broadly, and ultimately consider indexing (bogglehead) for investing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:42:36'] “I feel like the companies I picked aren’t terrible” - this is your problem right here. A good investment isn’t just about picking a good company, it’s about how much you pay for that company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 23:36:07'] The most reasonable thing to do is to make sure 2 things ; is this company ever going back up? And if its more or less the “ dip “ at the moment.If the answer is to both questions yes, buy more to bring your average down and exit with smaller loss or break even or with profit … If I believe in the company , I always bring my average down by investing more and so far its been working out for me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 23:42:34'] The average company lifespan is now just at 21 years. Logic would say purchase an actively managed fund or etf instead of picking companies. Nothing is for the long haul anymore and the only ones I’d believe in for years to come are Amazon, Google, Ford, Coca Cola, and the other commodities that go up an average of 7-10% per year
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 17:04:15'] Honestly the only good companies in that list are Amazon and Baba. Amazon - still overpriced I would buy around 50 bucks. Baba - too hard for me with geopolitical risks but I can see why people could buy it. PayPal - fintech is too hard for me too much competition and it’s moat and market share is diminishing. Wbd - I see why value investors might be interested but too much debt for me. PLTR - would not touch with ten foot pole funny FCF with all that SBC. BYND - just no.

Nothing on TikTok or any other bullshit where it's anything other than just straight up information from the company or investapedia where you can learn what things mean. Once you have an understanding then start looking at stocks you might want to get into and practice all of the things you've learned. Don't just decide you like a stock and buy it for that reason or because you use the service. Actually look at where you think you can make good entry points and have a plan for how long you will be invested and why you will be invested for that long. Don't just buy a stock that is a well known company and assume it will do well because it's done well in the past.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 00:09:43'] Dude, analyst consensus is $3800 for next 12 months and I believe it can go beyond that. To think of Amazon as Covid play or an online retailer is just idiotic. AWS is raking money and not slowing down, the company is constantly expanding in new domains (recent case in point - Amazon pharmacy). The machine never sleeps.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 05:47:14'] Topic creator I'm kind of in the same boat except I got in at 3215. I'm thinking it rallies hard mid-late december. Covid cases spiking + the vaccine temporary side effects are going to force states to have lockdowns again.Could be risky to hold into the new year though because of the georgia election and biden cracking down on big techI'll probably sell it before the end of the year, unless it's like 3400+ and then I would hold and see where the rainbow goes

(Based on my TA and ER analysis)So keep holding, unless u are looking for moons like nio or tesla (which are pumped up already), in that case sell it. Amazon is something you hold for long time.

NVDA deserves to be on that list more then TSLA. Teslas aren’t the only EV vehicles anymore and I don’t see AS much potential growth due to competition and price. Also from a personal opinion, the cars are big pieces of plastic! The quality is subpar to the price. But hey, that won’t stop investors.

They are going to have tough times as more and more the chip making moves to the companies using the chips instead of a third party.Google is already there with their TPUs which are setting records as being very efficient."Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records — And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsSaw that Cruise is now going to do their own.   Tesla is already there.This trend will continue.  Plus crypto will less and less be based on proof of work.   Two trends I do not see changing.   Out of this list the one I like by far the best is Google.  Just has a massive runway to work with built on all their assets yet fully moentized.  Should be able to fuel double digit growth for at least another decade.   Plus this is just amazing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avdpprICvNI

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 19:00:33'] TSLA and NVDA probably don't belong on this list unless they transform themselves into being much more than what they are now.RIght now I'd consider them similar to Netflix and Facebook: leaders at the time, but not enough moat or diversification to truly stay among the megacaps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 19:13:38'] You misspelled GME 😎
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 19:18:00'] I thought they were FAANG because of the extraordinarily high salaries they paid, not because of market cap. Hence Netflix and Facebook should still be in and Microsoft out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 21:20:49'] Yeah FB and Netflix suck. You know FB sucks cause they changed their name after the Facebook paper and are nowhere near a metaverse. Fb offers booking but digital addiction. No real service or value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 12:11:14'] For years, the FAANG fraternity represented big tech players that included Meta Platforms (earlier Facebook) (NASDAQ:META), Apple, Amazon, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),   and Google. Wang suggests dropping Meta Platforms and Netflix from the   list and adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia to the group. The analyst’s comments have come amid the underperformance of these mega-cap stocks in 2022. Not only this, the fact that Netflix and Meta   are struggling more than the others to stay relevant to their   stakeholders may have somewhat shaken Wang’s trust, triggering his   suggestion to drop them from the FAANG list.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-17 22:15:02'] Good thread and you make some great points.  Here is my "negative" opinion on the stock though:It's not done shit in 7 months.  July 10th 2020 the stock was $3,200.  It opened yesterday at $3,270.  Compared to other tech stocks, many of which have went up 15-50% in the past 6 months, AMZN just hasnt performed.  And yes, I know it gained around 70% last year...but I'm talking about the past 6-7 months specifically.Now with that being said I think that the stock is due for a breakout.  Price targets are high like you pointed out.  The past 3 earnings have blown expectations out of the water.  As a company they are still growing and management seems very capable.  The technical charts are also showing a pennant pattern which indicates that a breakout will most likely occur.  The questions is "When?"  It could be in the next few weeks or it could still be another 6 months from now.  Overall I still think the stock is fantastic for long term holds...but dont hold your breath for anything amazing in the short term because it may not perform.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-18 10:34:49'] So today the NASDAQ is off and AMZN is up .75%I have been watching this stock forever. $3700 by May. Let’s see if I’m right.

Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started "investing." The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  edit: downvoted for being a loser i already know

Plus, we use it all the time. I also bought some shares of apple, Microsoft, square, capital one, tesla, nio. \n\nWith Bezos stepping down, I was hoping to get some insight if selling this 1 stock is a great idea so I can invest it in other companies. Considering getting few more apple shares  then adding INAQ and PLTR to my portfolio. \n\nIve always heard that you dont sell Amazon, just let it grow but I feel like Im missing out on these new companies that could jump 30%++ in just a few months.'

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 10:07:59'] It depends on how much time are you willing to dedicate. You could make more money selling Amazon and swing trading other socks but you will have to keep an eye on the market everyday.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 08:39:45'] Agreed plus yes he’s stepping down, into the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors spot...make no mistake, he’s still in charge 😁
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 09:35:58'] Yeah, Amazon isn't going anywhere.  The pandemic also isn't going anywhere for a while, and Amazon is literally an integral part of society (that's not meant to be disingenuous).A stock like that, though, does go with the market (point being, if there is a crash in two months, which is reasonably possible, Amazon will go down with the others)
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 10:49:30'] take your profits and cash them in,buy some other tech stocks thathave a good track record like microsoft, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 12:54:46'] AMZN is expensive, and if you don't have a ton of cash why not look into LMT (Lockheed Martin) they are currently Undervalued, low volatility, and a fraction of the cost. It won't be explosive growth, but it will give your portfolio some stability / free up cash for other opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-11 20:38:44'] Amazon is pretty big and has all the money in this world to invest in whatever they want. Thing is though, they’ll get competition from other companies (Etsy, Shopify, etc.) and those companies will take some of their market share. I read somewhere that online retail only accounts for 16% right now. Idk how much of that potential growth reflects in Amazon stock right now. That’s the reason I wouldn’t bet my life on the stock but should do fine long term

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-11 21:36:58'] Breaking up Amazon's future expected growth, In the medium term it had a few more drivers - AWS, retail in emerging markets, advertising among the major ones. US retail probably stay flat out go downhill from here post covid and hopefully the other areas fill the gap. In the longer run, I am excited about the companies management to be a catalyst for the growth engine, they have bet on certain trends and got most of it right ( device's, streaming etc)  ( compared to a Google, .. ) . Something tells me they will be in self driving cabs or space mining etc when the timing is right. Though without covid they might have struggled to push through that short term high growth targets and would have been flat for a few more years.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:18:27'] It is going to remain an economic powerhouse.But the stock performance may or may not outperform because of very high valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-19 23:24:45'] It will absolutely NOT fall off in the short to medium term. CAGR % is amazing and Jeff Bezos said he has a vision of another 75 years for Amazon to thrive as a business. I would not bet against him. It's pricey but look at where the ball is going to land. Already close to $1 trillion in revenue (albeit with short margins lol!). Unless Amazon willl be regulated to the ground by the government, I don't see Amazon underperforming the market long term.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-11 21:17:40'] Amazon's *stock price* (company will still be a juggernaut) will suffer downward pressure from the law of large numbers over the coming years. Trees don't grow to the sky and you'll be better served trying to find smaller market cap companies that still have market cap room to run +5x or +10x  than bet on Amazon doing so. Apple, Microsoft and Google all suffer from the same law of large numbers issue. A break up of some of these companies might actually be a blessing in disguise for shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-11 20:15:24'] I don’t. I wouldn’t invest in it, on Buffet’s principle that you shouldn’t buy anything you don’t want for 10 years. The radical left is going to eat Bezos eventually.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 09:24:01'] It’s not about the speaker. Why don’t people get this. It’s about the AI. Apple has garbage AI in Siri. Anyone can make a good speaker, they are all over the place. Amazon and Google are now light years ahead in terms of the AI until Apple decides to try to really make something happen with Siri
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 06:12:53'] It’s not actually the same market, and I think that was a very deliberate choice from Apple going in.  The HomePod is focusing on the high end, and of course a $350 HomePod is not going to compete against a $50 Echo Dot.  A better comparison is against higher-end systems from Sonos & Bose.

A company called Energous (WATT) was rumored to be pioneering the technology. Check it out. If this is an announcement next month, I’ll buy one.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 10:40:45'] In addition to things others have already suggested, there is probably also a bit of a disconnect between this type of device and Apple's pursuit of (at least minimally) privacy-conscious consumers. *Everyone* has been railing on the Echo and things like the Xbox One's Kinect feature for years.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 11:43:48'] I just went through the process of getting a smart speaker and between all of the options I went with a 3rd party (Sonos One) so I could utilize all of the big 3's systems (Amazon, Google, and Apple). My takeaway was that Apple is missing the boat. Apple's speaker is focused on their music service and not integrating more tightly with the rest of their ecosystem. I actually might have considered Apple's speaker if it allowed voice control and integration with Apple TV, but even something as basic as that was missing.  No regrets going with Sonos for the multi-platform support.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 23:37:23'] I like your bull theory but please consider we are coming from the 3800 level, companies like Netflix, Nike, Shopify, Tesla, Coinbase, Lucid, carvana, etc., (a swing is a swing not all mentioned stocks are the same) have made a big run. I personally closed some positions and took profits. I am still optimistic but the 4080 is a resistance and we could also have a correction. There are still some swings but people should do stock pickings and avoid fomo
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 08:49:17'] I feel like a read a marketing newsletter and all it was missing was the sales pitch, “subscribe now and get our top 10 stocks to buy”.  I am with many already commented.  Too bullish for what’s coming in next two weeks.   There maybe some buying opportunities in a few areas of the market but definitely not in tech.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 04:51:04'] I’d take some profits now before Elon takes them for you. I just heard from Professor Galloway, that Twitter’s falling revenue may be “barely covering Elon’s interest payments” on his crazy floating rate loan to buy it. The fed is going to raise rates again in a few days, & my guess is the rate hike will be higher than what people think & it’s going to hurt Elon. Falling margins & dropping market share spells out another correction for Tesla stock. I’m sorry but Tesla was always priced for perfection & it simply fumbled one too many times. LMAO!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:35:03'] Tesla surges because of over-publications and high trading volumes rather than actual value.    It's overvalued as heck. It's real value is somewhere around $90, and I agree that it's not a good buy point atm.    Btw, I'm bullish for $TSLA for long term. It's going to double its revenue by 2026. I wrote a whole bullish analysis on it here [https://www.jika.io/post/7928ec3a-8c11-11ed-8080-800116f9b46e?rdttech](https://www.jika.io/post/7928ec3a-8c11-11ed-8080-800116f9b46e?rdttech)but current valuation is too much.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:22:03'] Apple was overbought by people who wanted to get into the market with no trading experience.New traders buy companies they know.Apple, Tesla, Google, Facebook and Amazon were all perceived as "safe" stocks so, as rhe market started to tank, scared money ran from new/growth companies to these bigger companies (as is typical in a rosk off event).Now the reality of earnings and sales projections is apparent. People are learning there are no "safe" stocks.When these stocks tank it will be a sign of retail trader capitulation which is a requisite for an overall capitulation in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 07:18:08'] The Apple business model doesn't justify forward PE of almost 25.  It's growth just isn't there like it used to be.  Perhaps the price is resetting down to a new normal befitting a more stable grower.  If this is the case the price is going down until the forward PE is in the teens.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:42:20'] I’m expecting a red week overall again this week. Might be a green day or two, but still red overall. Interest rates are going up again this week and it’s just a matter of time before consumer spending does really start slowing down. The Fed doesn’t give a shit about an incoming recession and has all but guaranteed it will happen in order to return inflation to a normal level. They’ve said so themselves. The implications of the increase interest hikes won’t come into full effect for months still. If you have unlimited investment money, keep DCAing on the way down. I’m waiting for shit to really hit the fan before I plop some extra money in myself.

That high growth of theirs is almost guaranteed to slow down in the near future (my opinion). They are all priced too high for low/no growth.I will start buying Apple when closer to 100$Microsoft when back under 200$I’m not certain about when to buy Google and Amazon yetObviously if these predictions are true the whole market will drop by a lot more (S&P is largely held up entirely by these companies)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 08:14:02'] It depends on your personal situation. When will you be forced to sell? Apple stock will face continual resistance along with all other stocks from  the macro headwinds of the current bear market.We still don't know if the bear market is short or long term. It may be over in a few months or maybe a few years. How long can you afford to wait? Selling early could lead to permanent wealth destruction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:42:22'] Nothing is wrong with Apple except they realize that people don’t want to shell out a grand for a new phone. There’s a recession coming (it’s been in all the papers) so what do people do? Hold off on big ticket items especially if they can use what they need for another year. Apple saw the recession ( why do you think they didn’t raise prices ) and decided to play it cool (why do you think they’ve lowered the volume for phones from OEM’s ) and now it’s just the markets reevaluating a recession priced Apple.  Wait for your price.  ( $125?  ) maybe
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 11:17:08'] Interest rates are going up.  People will have less money to spend.  Profits will go down.  But at some point interest rates will go down.  Apple has great products and services.  I like to buy when prices are low.  Most be willing and able to hold and wait.

However, NDX100 just needs to close with a 1% decline next week and it confirms it too. If next week is red, next 12 month projection is confirmed at most a 53% decline, at least a 33% decline. I wont predict a crash, because a 30% decline in a week is a crash.On the flip side this could be a bottom lol

In hindsight, I wish I unloaded all of it then.  Buying and holding Amazon, for me, has been an absolute disaster so far.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 18:23:00'] Stock market still has far too many companies trading above prices that their earnings dont actually support. I will share this that I’ve learned about the stock market during bear markets and high inflation. The stock market has never found a bottom until the rate of inflation and PE of the S&P 500 equaled to less than 20 when combined. It’s called the rule of 20 you can look it up. The average is around 18.2. Also, in 2021 the S&P doubled from its pandemic bottom, marking the fastest bull market rally since WWII. You don’t just brush off that kind of irrationality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 19:35:44'] As usual everyone isn’t looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn’t mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won’t care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what’s going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be “prudent”.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 16:22:49'] Yes, price traded lower today across all the majors; however, price still remains within the micro-trend's bullish consolidation zone. I provided a brief technical analysis on [SPY](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498279743) and [QQQ](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498292941) heading into the week; in short, nothing that occurred today impacted this analysis -- and in terms of upside potential -- could even be viewed as a positive. That said, even if this bullish consolidation does breakout to the upside, it will be limited due to so much resistance over head.

I expect a drop tomorrow and I'll rebuy.Just like I sold all my IP at 3:59 PM after the 10% increase after the earnings report only to see it drop 3% the next day and I bought my shares back.Similarly, FIBK dropped 10% for no apparent reason on its earnings report so I bought $3000 and made 6% in two days and sold that lot.All of this in the last two weeks, too.What's up with the insane price swings around these earnings reports?

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-23 20:35:11'] If I'm being honest your best choice since there are fees involved would be to put your $2000 into a good mutual fund with small fees. With 2000 dollars you cant really diversify and if you do pick more than 1-2 stocks your risk not making much if any at all because of trading fees. I'm no stock broker, though I did major in finance. Unless your wanting to take on more risk by choosing a few stock and not diversifying is fine, better to take more risks while your younger than when you're older

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 07:31:24'] Buying hype stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:38:04'] Doing a lot wrong.Read my investing bible1. Buy good companies with strong financial statements.  Companies with low debt, and companies that show a trend of growing and increased net income and revenue. Once you understand how to read a financial statement, you can make 70% of your decision to buy based on the financial statement, even before knowing what the company is. 2. Only buy companies that has a competitive advantage, one that would be had for another company to overtake them.  A company where you can envision that 50 years from now, they will still be relevant. 3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation. 4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don’t know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle. 5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn’t matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It’s hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.   6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money. 7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it’s only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run. 8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases. 9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don’t invest in the story, for example “marijuana stocks” is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.   10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don’t be prejudice because you don’t like investing in oil, or because it’s from China you don’t like Chinese people, or you don’t like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going. 11. Never sell a stock when it’s low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.   12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it’s life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it’s in the 7th inning, there’s not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow. 13. Do not options trade, it’s gambling.  It’s hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.     Written by Ethan Lee

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:56:03'] You are buying/holding stocks that heavily depend on cheap capital for their expansion - this is an excellent strategy when interest rates are near zero. Since this is not the case, tech orientated stocks are likely to drop. There are of course microecnomic factors at play (think of Meta e.g.), but generally the rule is rsthwr simple - the cost of money will determine the price of stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 06:55:46'] I would balance out the big tech stocks. Amazon looks to be a heavy percentage.I would swap out VUG for VTIAnd I would scrap Intel / Rivian . Intel is trending downwards, if your doing it for growth I think AMD/NVIDIA/TSMC is a way better play, especially at the current valuations. And it seems like your portfolio is heavy growth so I don’t know if you care much about the dividend yield. Not very bullish on Rivian, but also not to read up on them. So I can’t speak to that company as much. But my ignorant perspective is that there are much better, unprofitable risky stocks than Rivian. (Personally I like SOFI at these prices) Would probably scrap Berkshire too and put that money into some of the big tech or VTI. Doesn’t really fit the overall portfolio IMO. This is me bored nitpicking though, totallyNot advice lol . I actually dig the portfolio

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 17:54:04'] It seems no one is paying attention to interest rates. Banks are going to tell the tale next week when the story of no new loans, paying higher interest rates to customers and everyone wants to send money for free to everyone else becomes the realization that an over 4 % ten year may not be the top. A strong unemployment report (whisper 265k) will mean -we can afford 5% rates.  Killing inflation is hard. Turning the boat around when a recession starts is painful. A potential nuclear situation is a black swan October event. Take your pick. There’s too much money around. Cash will still be king.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-06 10:08:04'] It is really normal being late for a Retail Trader, having a lot of money like insitutionals makes it easier to be the first to the party because in some way they create the party. Without volume any stock goes up and only with a really massive quantity of retail investors you could make a similar % of the volume in the market. Also a retail investor has less information than institutionals (it is their job xd) and less hour to being informed.

Bunch of bullshit guesses of a pivot or a pause or any stupid wish that we could go magically higher. Too much F’king money that every one has trying to make something happen. We are going lower as rates go higher. I’ve mentioned before we need to see a 40 % down Nasdaq, a 28k Dow and at least a 3400 SPX where everyone will get scared shitless and get out and then the long term players can finally get back in.  The Fed is finally taking the punch bowl away and letting the gamblers lose their money.  You could see this coming a mile away. Just too many young investors never dealing that yes, you can buy the dips as long as you realize you may bloody your hand on the falling knife. I don’t know what kind of holiday season we will have but the consumer may either buy because there’s no tomorrow or save their money for the high priced groceries, doctor bills, high gas prices and losing their job.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 13:42:40'] No better asset to launder and transfer money
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 14:03:01'] That's the problem with bubbles. You look at the back mirror, and you say: "this is perfect".  You have to see what is sutainable and what not. For example when stock offer their true earnings to the shareholders, and the price goes 50x through the years, their earnings also go 50x. Sometimes in history you see some multiple expansion or contraction. So some good years, promise lower returns, and after some bad years, the promise is better than average.  However, when you are something that doesn't produce any value, the price is just a fuction of supply/demand and speculation. No real value produced there. The price can do whatever, but this is not sustainable.  I am not impressed, but nice that you share.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:24:30'] The only reason this went up was interest rates went down. Second day of “falling rates” if you count a few basis points as falling. The middle day of profit taking showed me how easy this market will go down as the hucksters took the profits of the schmucks who think wow, this market is great it’s going up, hell I’ll buy!!!  There is no long term growth. Disney showed us tonight. So has Affirm. The buy now pay later routine was the same deal as the housing market which was the same deal of 5% down in five days for a margin account in 1929. The clock is ticking. Still to many kids with too much money trying to make a quick buck day-trading, options playing, and trying Forex. I don’t know where or when the time bomb is going off but trust me, in every bear market there is always some stupid capitulation event.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 17:44:13'] Decent pullback today (by volatile, 2022 standards) on near-average volume across the majors. Both SPY & QQQ remained within what could become an inside bar if the pattern matures -- more so than a bull flag at this point.    SPY's price action was more interesting by comparison due to its pullback coming close to the minor support trendline -- 397.90 will need to hold tomorrow for the bulls    QQQ has more room below at 279.97 for the bulls to hold its inside bar. Regardless, the bulls do not have much room to the upside on either SPY or QQQ, so any breakout will likely be limited, if one comes at all.    IWM pulled back a full percentage point more than SPY. Often a 'leading indicator,' the IWM fell to nearly close below what still may be an inside bar pattern, but given today's price action, more likely suggests a break to the downside. Bulls need 180.70 to hold.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 13:04:29'] I invest in VOO & BRKB.  I only add new money to BRKB when it’s been underperforming VOO for some period, 3 months, 6 months, etc. BRBK ended up being a good place to park money when FAANGs were blowing up and VOO was getting too over valued. BRBK is designed to work best in this environment and should outperform VOO next 3 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 13:40:43'] VOO has outperformed BRK in last 12 years of total return. VOO 285%. BRK-B. 279%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 14:02:47'] Just buy VOO, so you don't have to think about it so much. AMZN and BRK.B are the 3rd and 4th holdings of VOO already, so you already own them. As time goes by you will find other stocks you want so you will constantly be buying and selling, paying fees and taxes along the way. Just buy the index fund and keep it simple.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 19:16:43'] The micro-trend's bullish consolidation on both the SPY & QQQ pierced, and more importantly closed, above their flag's celing, but much more so on the SPY than the QQQ.  As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY).  Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.The fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.Critical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.  Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 17:03:43'] My suggestion is to start with an index fund such as VOO, VTI or similar.  Do that while you learn about investing.  Most people will not beat the market regardless of what they claim.  Once you have a good working knowledge of stocks and how to invest, consider moving into individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 21:09:59'] Your first investment should be in paper trading so that you don't waste real money trying to learn how to use your brokerage interface and tools.Then, continue paper trading as you learn about the different investment types you can make, and what type of strategy you want to learn. (Buy and hold, swing trading, day trading, options trading, futures trading, ETFs and Index products, etc.)There is a lot to learn even before making your first trade, and you need to have a plan to manage your risk, which is key to longevity in trading.Start with paper, then once you understand the basics of your trading platform, and are comfortable with your chosen strategy, then graduate to small amounts of real money.Once you find that you can consistently be profitable doing that, then up the stakes incrementally. Don't jump the gun. It doesn't usually end well.Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 10:40:28'] I’d honestly say choose your own stocks wisely and do your research on the company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 22:44:19'] If you're looking for consistent long term growth I would recommend looking into mutual funds, they're basically groups of stocks in various sectors so generally speaking they're a bit more stable in growth than single stocks. Good way to put your money towards industries you support/believe in without having to pick one single company

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 09:11:14'] QQQSCHDA mix of dividend aristocratsPick a reitPerhaps jepi for a covered call ETFQQQ over the long haul will perform great for you but has a bigger downside risk than SCHD. The downside risk is basically that if the market plunges ina single year qqq will likely plunge further than SCHD but on the flip side it has better growth on average.Between those two you will have a somewhat riskier approach and a somewhat conservative approach. Both are good choices and both are worth putting money into.The dividend aristocrats will provide additional stability to your account. The reit will provide a monthly dividend that can compound. Over a very long period that can add up to a sizeable revenue stream.The jepi or covered call ETF will also provide a regular income stream that is different from the reit. Again not a bad idea.As for how to balance between those that depends upon your goals and the tax status of the accounts you have the money in. The longer the money will be held the more attractive qqq and schd will be. The more you want it to assist with bills in 5 years time the better jepi looks. The reit and dividend aristocrats are somewhere in the middle.

Anything above 275-285 is a good report which requires some partial lobotomies to accept the negativity ( or be happy for those who have jobs.)  interest rates are still key to our ups and downs. We gave a 50% retracement of the 4% high down to 3.60 and now back to 3.82 on the 10 year. The same retracement on the dollar, the Pound and my brokerage account. There is a wide old axiom for the stock market that goes back to since the Federal Reserve was created. It’s simple. After the Fed raises interest rates after 2 or 3 raises GET OUT of the market !!! You will save a lot of money doing that. You don’t go back in until the Fed gives the all clear and starts lowering them. Trust me. The market is always lower by the 3 or 4th raise.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:00:44'] Well a semi interest week over run by Fed announcement at 2 PM On Feb 1st.  Expected to raise .25 but could it be .50 instead? Why several .25’s over the next four to five months as opposed to getting to 5% and sitting there. Of course unemployment out on Friday and if there is no sign of an increase or if wages are still increasing then the Fed will have wished for the 1/2 point.  There are nothing but 50/50 people’s who can’t figure out where we are going.  “Things are getting better!”  “We are IN a recession!” “Fed knows NoTHInG!” to “Earnjngs are dropping!”  Each day is an up and down seesaw which means something has to break. It always does from 9/11 to Housing bust to CoVid and Y2K and Gulf War. Complacency is a dangerous world to live in when you have money on the line. Be prepared for anything g because something always happens sooner or later. Such is the essence of our world and markets

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-04 09:02:51'] Bullish on Amazon. I think we will definitely see an upward trend leading up to earnings on the 23rd. FedEx has an upward trend leading to their earnings report in June, and it jumped nearly another 20% after reporting positive earnings. I honestly can’t think of a logical reason as to why Amazon wouldn’t have a positive earnings report. 20% may be a stretch, but a gradual upward trend is not unimaginable.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-05 05:00:39'] Never buy calls timed with earnings? That's the best advice I can give. Implied volatility goes down and you might lose big. For a more thorough reasoning see this  https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms

Might get a rally then but if the GDP is good, unemployment strong and no downwards in CPI and PPI and PCE and we will get higher rates, 5-6 percent in the next two quarters.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 17:58:19'] Tomorrow looks like another bloody day. Breaking that 3900 dam means a retest. The head of Fed Ex told his people a World wide recession is coming. I’ve heard others begin to say that. You got bullish analysts predicting 46-4800 eoy which has been a foolish prediction for months. The reason for no capitulation? Not enough pain. Will Dow 29,000 be enough pain? Or will it be Dow 25,000. Imagine that and SPX 3200. These sound like really pain points because there are too many idiots saying buy the dips and that’s the reason for no VIX spike, no fear of 70-120 SPX drops, and the bullish believe of pivots and low gas prices means no inflation or recession. The last 20 years has too many young analysts who have never first handed a real true recession. 2001 was almost a recession but the black swan event (9/11) turned it into a market crash. 2008 no one saw coming. Most of these old time analysts who still work for Financial firms are trying not to scare any clients which is why no one tells you to get out the first time the fed raises interest rates. Of course the smart money knows how to make money in a bear market, which we are in. Are you the smart money or just a novice investor ( few years or less).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 08:43:00'] Add that those gains are multiplied by the number of shares of these companies in the fund, then divided by the number of existing shares for the fund itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 09:45:43'] Why do you have those dollar signs near the green/red arrows? It just suggest that every share of every company is worth $100 on day one, which is a very weird thing for anyone who knows anything about investing. It would be better if it would be shown in percent.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 00:26:24'] What’s also nice is that the fund keeps adding winners and rotates out the failures.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 05:57:36'] The only issue with Index Funds that are market cap weighted is that it banks on stocks that are already heavily invested in. So, you do get diversification but mostly among the 5 to 10 market cap heavy stocks. If all of them perform poorly...the whole index tanks. Whereas, equal weighted index funds do better but not by much. You have to diversify even between index funds in your portfolio. If you are tech heavy in one, you need another thats utilities or consumer staples heavy and so forth. This is in addition to large cap, mid cap and small cap distributions in your overall portfolio. Will write a blog on this some day. :-)

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:48'] Yeah.  Warren Buffett’s point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    If you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you’d obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.  Most people can’t and, as a practical matter, don’t really have the time for any of this.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 08:02:28'] Off course they will... The question is how soon?
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 09:36:46'] AMZN definitely. They have shown they can be a player in basically any industry. AAPL I'd be a little more worried about. They've pulled themselves out of holes before, but they aren't as innovative as they once were and I'd be worried about people's brand loyalty with so many new competitors. Also, whenever we do get a recession, I wonder how many people are still gonna be buying their premium prices.
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 16:46:21'] Apple’s core business is iPhones.  Even their other lines of business (service, warranty, watches, AppStore) are all directly tied to iPhones.  Even Mac sales are heavily driven by people developing apps.  I know a lot of people that have an iPhone and an iPad.  I know very few people that have an iPad alone.So Apple needs to come up with something new to drive growth.  We have reached peak smartphones and this means all players in smartphones will now see margins squeezed in the coming years.  I like Apple products.  I have an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  In facts I have more than one of each.  That doesn’t mean I think their stock is worth buying right now.Apple’s is supposedly going to go into the video streaming business.  My concern there is that space is going to get very crowded in the next few years.  Seems like everyone is planning a new streaming service.— I think Amazon will eventually recover.
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 08:07:02'] Amazon will but Apple is going to start trending downward over the next decade. Look around the office/classroom and see that less and less people are getting the new apple products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 18:10:56'] I was thinking the markets look like they want to go up but there’s too much money realizing we are heading for a recession. That’s why the bond market rates are going down. Not because of future lower rates but because a recession is coming. Sooner than we think. Imagine TWO (2) too rate hikes of .50 in December AND in the first week of February.  Wait for the markets to try and wrap their heads around that idea.  I’m starting to DCA on investments I like.

	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 04:52:52'] If you're investing long-term, just get in now
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 06:50:51'] If you have done your DD, and believe the company is a good investment, the best time to invest is yesterday. Time in the market beats timing the market. In the long term, buying in at $1000 and buying in at $950 really isn't a huge difference.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 19:06:26'] The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time would be now. Don't try to time the market, nobody has a crystal ball. As mentioned by someone else, if you're looking to go long, invest now. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 13:59:31'] I can't get in because it seems so expensive.  That being said, I do own a retail stock and I can tell you that Amazon is only continuing to swallow up market share.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 14:11:13'] Thank you for all your feedback - I waited a little and got in at 996 this afternoon. With the WholeFoods purchase and AMZN's pharma possibilities I just wanted to make a move sooner than later.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-20 14:17:43'] >What approx target price should I be looking for on a down day?lol wutIf you're buying 10 shares presumably you have the financial means to hold long (that doesn't necessarily follow actually, but AMZN isn't much of a daytrader stock). If this is the case I don't see why you'd want to wait for AMZN to hit a price target on a down day.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-30 13:42:34'] They also tell shareholders to “take a seat”. How will that also affect the market?
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-30 13:47:31'] Does anyone think Amazon won’t continue to gobble up markets? They haven’t even begun to dominate IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-30 15:01:35'] What happened with that sudden 5% drop after hours? That wasn't normal trading. Who sold what?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 15:39:18'] The one that gives me the most dread is the long, soul-sucking slog between 1966 and 1982 — in other words, the 1970s. The stock market went up and down and up and down, but in the end went absolutely nowhere for 16 years.So there's a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for 10 years, sort of like this ‘66 to ‘82 time period.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 12:49:26'] Reminds me of “Blade”….Bloodbath!! Minus Traci  Lords
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 20:49:34'] Just looking for a + anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 18:31:42'] Is this what winning looks like?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 19:09:49'] Decide what the bottom is then invest some..especially dividend stocks. Is this the bottom? Or do you think it goes lower? You decide. But this is not a get rich quick market. Ride it out. I have been investing in stocks that pay a nice dividend..like CAT. DOW,Inc..and even a sleeper in KULR.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 21:00:40'] I remember a few years ago go this was all green.

POST_TEXT: b"I think it's going to rally soon. What's your take?"
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 16:44:05'] Without a doubt, it will rally, barring that it doesn’t.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 16:42:37'] Maybe. Could go down though.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 16:45:35'] It’s probably gonna blast off. But then again it might not.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 16:49:05'] Some would say it's going tooSome would say its not
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 17:13:23'] There’s a distinct possibility we could rocket to all time highs tomorrow. There’s also a really good chance we won’t.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-10 23:40:35'] Junk.  Crappy and incredibly poorly run company with a business model that isn't even remotely viable.  Even the profitable parts of it are under heavy competition for which they do not possess an enduring long-term proprietary advantage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 21:35:14'] Another opportunity is coming to create wealth. If one has to time the market to buy, then September's a no brainer. I can 100% guarantee Sept will be a negative month, especially the 3rd week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 13:34:58'] But.. i guess more upside incoming. Dxy about to top. Index got pos div weekly rsi.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 22:38:27'] Print a bunch of money and send it to all the companies in the red. Surely the consumers will find a way to survive the inflation. We'll be back on track for a balanced functioning economy in no time at all. 50% of the time it works every time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 23:06:20'] Can anyone tell me if they believe target would increase by September? Wondering because I have a option open on it. Currently down bad.
