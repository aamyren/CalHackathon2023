POST_TEXT: b"this stock just tore through yesterday and blew past my strike price today. Guessing I overplayed my hand . Has NVDA done this to anybody else?\n\nTrying to learn from this experience. I understand its a volatile stock but I couldn't understand how to price these events or scenarios in while picking a strike price. At the time of selling, the prob of ITM was 18% and today its 50%. granted its only an indicator and not surity, but can you provide any ideas about what other metrics to look at while picking a strike price.\n\nI own the stock but didn't want it called away if it comes to that. Lesson learnt. I will make a profit if its assigned so profit is not the worry.\n\nwhat should the strategy be with volatile stocks? Do we always close our position before expiration? Trying to learn the mechanics here\n\nAny input is appreciated."
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 11:58:42'] You are selling at all time high, isnt it? Is that really a problem? I guess you can either buy back or sell a CSP.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:35:48'] If you are not comfortable with the stock getting called away you shouldn't be selling covered calls at that strike! Either way congrats on the profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 09:39:12'] What does this even mean??? Why the hell sell an option then??? SMH Let's get this straight. When you sell a covered call, you are AGREEING to sell that stock at the strike price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:26:57'] Why on Earth would you sell covered calls for NVDA?If there's one thing virtually guaranteed here, it's that this company is not going to trade flat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 15:46:14'] Just let it go and  switch to  cash secured puts with 415 strike, play both sides and be patient
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:47:32'] bought in december 2021, was under water until the AI boom, now up 40%, of 6 shares, but up $750.   I usually have terrible luck, on options that I hold for longer than a day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:15:06'] You can rollout for a future time to increase profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 04:49:26'] I had 400 shares and sold out.  Take your profits and don‚Äôt FOMO the gains you missed in the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:20:07'] Put it this way. NVDA will not be a $1.5T company in 12 months. Getting your shares called away during this insane mania rally is going to be a smart move in hindsight. Maybe not within the next 30 days, but definitely within 6-12 months. You can never sell exactly at the top, but just get it close enough. This is a company where one mediocre earnings report will tank it -20% minimum.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:18:36'] Number one rule of opitions is be 100% ok with the strike price
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 10:01:09'] Nearly every stock I sold a covered call on got called away recently and everything I haven't sold one is doing nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:18:41'] Why would you sell covered calls during the start of a bull market  + AI craze. Read the room.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:38:09'] Here is what I did. It didn‚Äôt make the situation any better but I got out of the CC. I was in the same situation. Sold CC when price was $180 for $270 strike (my cost basis) but 1.5 years out to get a hefty premium. Then the market rocketed. I waited till it got to $285. Bought a long leaps to release collateral from CC as my leaps became the collateral making it a debit spread. Sold NVDA for $285. But now my long call is up and short call is way down. My long call‚Äôs breakeven is much higher also. I‚Äôm fretting now if I should exit long call and profit about $12k and leave short call naked hoping it will come back to earth. Not sure what to doü•µ
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:50:10'] Picking a CC strike price is ultimately saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to sell here‚Äù and letting it play out. If it happens, you live with it being called away or you collect the premium. I only ever close them early if there‚Äôs only 5-10% left with too much time still. You had no ‚Äúhand‚Äù, just being greedy and moved away from the original trade. CCs aren‚Äôt just free money. And NVDA just moved $80 in one day from an ER less than a month ago and your surprised it moved $20 in a day? Maybe zoom out? Momentum is only trending up since then, so no idea how you thought it is in a downtrend. The strategy here is when making a trade, stick to your thesis and don‚Äôt get emotional. If you weren‚Äôt willing to sell there, why‚Äôd you sell the CC? You can either buy to close it at a loss or let it go get called or see what happens by expiry. If you really want back in, you could sell CSP at 415 strike for break even entry, if it comes back down or eat a small loss buying back in at 420/425. Loss at 420 would be minimal. But at 425 probably same cost as buying back the CC. Be deliberate and stick to your guns. Probabilities mean nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:25:24'] Roll it out to next week or just take the L..not a big deal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 22:12:18'] Has happened to me few times and learnt my lessons that I can share,1. Roll before the option is deep ITM (- but hard to plan for sudden events like this - the big order NVDA received)2. Have a SL - yes you can have one for options.3. Let it be called away - profit never hurts and wait for pull back4. Option selection - its a combo of things, what‚Äôs your PT for the stock, geeks (e.g look for delta of above 30, see a fast decaying - theta et al).5. If trend looks positive you can ride the wave as well by exploring atm options. (Many of these strategies on YT).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 05:28:41'] I would let it get called away. There are other plays you don't need nvda. I don't think fomoing back into a play you already sold out of is a good idea. (A covered call is selling, you can't count on it never hitting)Nvda may go up, nvda may go down, but buying back your cc is taking an unforced loss.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 08:17:00'] Trend following, classic pull back(shorters wants the top) now trapped and stops triggering, higher we go. Trend following. Simple game of how to punish traders who are emotionally based. Same for longs, trues to buy bottoms only to get lower bottoms. Be aligned with market action at all times and know your next trade is INDEPENDENT of your last trade. Your equity is good as your next trade. This is a business if you think edge exists in knowing formulas. It doesn‚Äôt, it exists in you(your behavior) analyze it, see what works and see what doesn‚Äôt and do what more of it what does and less of what doesn‚Äôt..95 percent of trading is psychological, 10 percent mechanical/technical/funnymentals.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 08:51:38'] Why did you sell a call on the best stock in this market? You need to learn a lot before putting money to work. You should learn and then trade, otherwise you are paying to learn shitty habits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:58:26'] Just roll out and keep on rolling out every week if u have to. Edit: ignore the negative comments, its all a gamble in the end.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:59:10'] Could've bought a much higher strike price call as protection
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:19:02'] Last year I got assigned on a single 250 put, which I rolled into two 210s puts. Got assigned. Needed a tax loss so sold covered calls as part of a wheel strategy losing both at 150. Average price with premiums was around 175 for 200 shares. Forgone revenues are in excess of $45,000. Fuuuuuck
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 10:56:39'] Whats with all the pseudo intellectuals and covered calls? Someone shilling strategies or something?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 08:58:12'] I mean this seriously - do not play options with Nvda; I continually get burned and finally learned in lat January to stop option trading Nvda as it follows few predictable trading patterns.Successful, Option trading is designed for low volatility, high volume bets.  I‚Äôve made more money option trading CARR in smaller payments than Nvda.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 10:51:58'] There‚Äôs no metrics to really look at.  Choose a strike where you‚Äôre willing to sell the stock (ideally above cost basis!).  Let it go if it expires ITM.  It‚Äôs simple, but not easy.  Imagine the poor fuckers who sold CCs at the beginning of the year!  Your timing was pretty excellent by comparison.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 11:05:33'] You can always sell an ATM P and keep your shares if it rises or double your position with an added premium if it dips. I do this often (rode Shopify and CCL up with CSPs)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 11:49:24'] Cover calls is a sissy play. Watch delta and iv, itm, or atm leap options‚Ä¶that will drive your sp. Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 12:05:49'] One other thing you can do (if you'd really rather prefer not to lose the stock), is to just open a CSP below that strike or wait until they do get called away and open a CSP next week.  Just remember that you need to take deltas with a grain of salt in high IV situations like this in the future, and you're probably better off not selling a CC unless you really, truly want to sell the stock.  In most cases, selling the CC isn't worth it if you really wouldn't be 100% comfortable selling the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:11:39'] Don't sell, only buy. Duhhhh
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:47:34'] Still plenty of time my friend
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:52:14'] I like to use the P/L diagram to determine which option position to take. I was on the right-side of an NVDA trade a few weeks ago, but the price dipped the day before expiration and I sold when the market opened. I was worried about liquidity if the trade didn't go to my favor. Since NVDA has been on a bull run, you might consider selling puts and buying an equal number of puts at a lower strike. would this be a bull-put spread?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 18:18:11'] Supply and demand
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:05:39'] I don't really know what your issue is here. You're making a profit on your call, right? Why not just sell a put with that fresh new collateral? The July 21 $410 is almost $1500 and you might just get lucky and get your stock back for cheaper than you sold it for.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:14:03'] > the prob of ITM was 18%This is going to get downvoted, and not everyone is going to understand this: the "probabilities" are abstractions to some model no-one knows (no your broker is not backsolving to black scholes). It does. not. reflect. reality.> what should the strategy be with volatile stocks? Do we always close our position before expiration? Trying to learn the mechanics hereYour options:1. buy it back or roll it out3. get assigned, recover with CSP. Be sure to factor in tax implications if you're long term capital gains.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:14:41'] You can‚Äôt ask non-billionaires how to predict best time/strike/price to sell a call at. If anyone could do this better than you (or better than an average person) then they would be on a private yacht getting a massage, not here on Reddit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 02:56:31'] Roll that shit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 04:42:01'] It's not over yet. Pulling back...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 08:28:25'] My 315 call post earnings which I sold when it was at 275 got blown by crazily. Ended up letting both get called away and took profits.I thought I was being smart and took some TLH last year when I sold at 140s when my cost basis was in 200s
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 10:00:17'] Value investor here.  Don't sell calls on a stock you want to own, \*especially\* when they are volatile. If that's too restrictive, only sell on a portion of the stock you're willing to lose.  Realize the short-term profit is nice but compounding is better, esp. at tax advantage through long-term capital gains rates.  NVDA's H100s are selling like hot-cakes right now, I don't know of any company better positioned to take advantage of AI, do you think AI is going to go down anytime soon? I'd expect NVDA to continue to shoot up for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 14:38:58'] Happens all the time, either close the contract on the 16th or roll it out longer
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 02:08:16'] Happens to me all the time (TSLA, NVDA), and I like it. Sell a CSP ATM or ITM with the same EXD- either get assigned and earn the stock again or earn an extra Premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 10:11:16'] Roll it up and out for a credit to capture additional profits would be my goto if the stock price hasn‚Äôt hit ITM  yet.   If ITM, you‚Äôll have to go even further out to be able to roll up and out.  How long were you planning on holding NVDA?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 09:19:31'] You have time, negative reaction to fomc and huge option expiration this week, you might be totally fine and be able keep the shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 14:51:51'] You can roll it to July for a small credit/even and hope it doesn‚Äôt stay at these absurd levels?

POST_TEXT: b'So like the rest of retail, I think nvda is likely overvalued in the long term but still has short term hype upside. \n\nGoing into earnings the implied move looks to be around $20 (7%) so Im thinking about opening an imbalanced iron condor where I have downside protection that covers the whole position on a miss but still has around 60-90% upside potential on an earnings or expectations beat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 06:20:32'] Iron condor on a stock like NVDA around earnings seems a terrible idea. I‚Äôd primarily see ICs for low volatility or channel trading ie within a certain range. Very wide ICs wouldn‚Äôt give enough R/R in my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 08:08:45'] This is going to trade like a short fly. It‚Äôs really a short iron fly not a condor. You basically wash on the short side if it tanks. Your break even on the high side is 326.61. Your max gain is $2750. Short flies are tough. They hold on to their value for a long time. So any intraday movement in your favor might not give you a good exit. The question is how likely you think the bear case is. Is that just insurance on a tank? There are structures that would give you better returns and a lower break even on the high side. Like a ZEBRA with +2/-1 (or +3/-2) 295c 310c. You can add a put or put spread to that for mitigating losses on the low case. A reverse-risk reversal where you sell a put to finance a call would also pay better and reduce your breakeven in the bullish case.If you think the bear case has a high probability, then I would try and tighten it up. You lose money between 298.39 and 326.61 which is a $28 range with a $20 straddle. The potential for a miss is there but there‚Äôs also the potential for a modest pop that doesn‚Äôt reach 326 or passes it but runs down the rest of the day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 13:08:32'] This might end horribly. I love it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 19:09:21'] Terrible trade. Since you're long delta, you're fighting post-earnings IV crush, and you need NVDA to move more than 6% in either direction just to break even. You're looking at a loss of about $500 if NVDA doesn't move much. This is why I never go long on short-dated options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 19:16:07'] This is a broken wing long iron butterfly. You‚Äôre long ATM calls and puts and short OTM calls and puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 05:41:18'] I love it when someone is willing to take a position with conviction. Reading through these comments, it seems that many are not understanding the risk in the trade.  You're risking 1,411. You need a pretty big move -- above 325 to make this pay -- and the expected move is right around 19.  NVDA trades about $4.00 lower in premarket, which is not too good for this trade to the upside. But you're also set up with a bailout to the downside.    Curious to see what happens with NVDA.  I don't have a position yet, but it owes me some money.  My instinct would be to sell the JUN 275's and JUN 340's, OR some kind of unbalanced fly in the puts.    Hope your trade works out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 13:26:08'] Huge beat by nvda, congratulations!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 06:17:18'] If it makes the implied move upward, it'll hit $330 and you won't be happy. You're betting against the continuation of a strong stock in a market uptrend on a very short timeline. I don't think this is a good risk/reward proposition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 07:47:15'] A debit trade with inflated IV costs needs a SUBSTANTIAL move in your direction to make it profitable with the IV crush you'll get. It's generally not a good trade. A better trade would be an in/out debit vertical reducing your overall cost basis... Even that isn't great.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 06:40:20'] That‚Äôs terrible trade.  Not even outside the expected move.  You‚Äôll lose $1000s.  If you thought it was overvalued then just do a call spread.   Lol don‚Äôt sell on both sides.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:14:49'] Don't be like me. I sold covered calls twice on NVDA. Once on the runup from metaverse. Lost out on doubling my gains from 30k to 60k. Second time I sold one 3 months ago and nvda rallied from my 300 purchase price to 380. I'll sell cover calls on stuff. But that's the last time I sell ccs on NVDA. Sat out on 30-40k of gains for a measly $800 I got from selling the CCs.Edit: Not double the gains. Double the amount in my account from 30 to 60k.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:32:03'] you could sell the NVDA stock to a round lot (down to 100 shares) and use that capital to do what you're looking to do. this would still give you the option of selling CCs as wellsince you're not going to play capital gains tax on the sale, there's no real downside to just selling stock here if you want to diversify more  FWIW, selling 8 shares would cover your entire cost basis for the position PLUS secured profit of around 300% if you've purchased at a $7.50 average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:09:36'] Just sell some to reduce the size down to your desired weight. No need to get unnecessarily fancy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:56:22'] I understand wanting to diversify. Can't blame you with Nvidia's current price either but If you have a longer term view I wouldn't completely liquidate. However, with Amazon I would much rather reduce it to a very small position due to the consistent negative quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:39:51'] If you want to diversify, just sell most of it. It's a tax free account so there are no capital gains taxes to worry about. I wouldn't bother with CCs in your situation. There is a very real chance that NVDA corrects. How would that make you feel?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:04:57'] Selling $30 OTM calls every two weeks would net $480 in premium ($420 strike right now). That seems like a very agreeable price to me even in the event of a run up. You‚Äôre free to do whatever you want, including selling now. But that‚Äôs a really REALLY nice OTM to premium ratio to me.Weekly would be about $240. This next week is a day short, so premiums closed Friday at $200. Either 1 week or 2 weeks would work
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:19:55'] What about selling some NVDA to buy them? Realize some gains and reduce the chance of losing more if you sell a call and the stock tanks or it takes off and you end up not being along for the ride.You can't just add to the other 2 companies you listed without selling?You want to diversify but you'd be almost completely out of NVDA if the shares get called away.PS: I sold NVDA just before this $100 run :/ and most of what I've been selling calls on has cost me a lot of unrealized gains. Of course all of my stocks I'm not selling CCs on are doing nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:20:25'] Bro! Me too! Welcome to the +2000% club!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 15:57:52'] Sell puts. This baby is flying

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:30:33'] If you're trying to get rid of the shares I would say just sell them, but if you're committed to a CC strategy you should probably sell an ITM CC rather than OTM
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:20:28'] What‚Äôs making you sell now rather than the 7 years you‚Äôve been holding?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:31:09'] Thanks for selling a call.  Now it will go up another 20 percent.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:06:58'] You could do what I just did: Sell a Jan 24 500 Call and use the premium to buy a Jan 24 310 Put.Yes, you end up basically even on premium, maybe you cash a couple hundred, but it gives you downside protection and if it gets called at 500 then you should be very happy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:33:59'] $20 out might not pay much....especially a week or 2 out.   It's a decent strategy if you truly want to sell, but if there's a runup, it's painful to watch on the sidelines as your contract becomes worthless and the shares you "kind of own" are worth a thousand more than they were 3 days ago and you can't cash in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:37:33'] Don‚Äôt waste your energy on the NVDA CC.  Make your decision to hold it for the price you want or have a stop loss.  At most, I‚Äôd do June 16 call 410 if you want to squeeze that $1000 premium right now.  Don‚Äôt cloud your judgment on your best trade ever.  Hold it or sell it and don‚Äôt regret it.  Context.  I crushed with AAPL in early 2000s. Average cost in <$10 dollar range.   In 2019, sold over 1000 shares for help with down payment on vacation home.  AAPL has gone up a lot since then.  So has that property and never regretted decision.  Currently have 1800 shares from remaining 2000 I had.  My goal was to sell off 500 and diversify.  I‚Äôve done that with 200.  The other 300 are in CC that shot past my CC on this last run from $130 up to 170s.  I don‚Äôt think about any of the other moves, but these CC for squeezing that last bit of gain before diversifying has tied me up while I‚Äôd rather make other buys with that money on my time frame and clear mind.  Wasn‚Äôt worth it.  Maybe for you it‚Äôs worth it but not me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 18:24:11'] 3 months ago the price rallied from 300 to 380?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 21:20:57'] Can anyone clarify the tax implications of selling covered calls of the same stock at vastly different price points and what that means for tax loss and gain?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:23:17'] A lot of these guys seem to be saying the same thing and I'm going to agree with them.So one or two shares to cover the purchase of a put of your portfolio and roll the put.If you really wanted to do something you could potentially purchase the put, and so current months or week 15% out call.You're just going to have to have alerts set up for the call, this way you collect premium in the same time that premium pays for the hedge of the puts that you're buying that will protect your investment for 180 days.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:48:36'] NVDA and AMZN are winners. Unless you feel the company is suddenly worse I wouldn't sell a drop.

POST_TEXT: b'My trading style dictates that Im always long volatility and the best way to do this Ive found is with back ratio spreads on volatile stocks. \n\nI opened a this back ratio onNVDA immediately after the large move up fully expecting it to keep going up but wanted downside exposure nonetheless so I opened this position 2 SEP 335 P and then -1 SEP 385 P for a small credit. \nSince then NVDA has gone up and the long puts are down 57% but those losses have almost entirely been offset by the short leg.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 01:20:06'] If your strategy is to always be long volatility on high volatility stocks, then you are losing money in the long run. It's a known fact that implied volatility is overstated on average.In the case of NVDA I agree that the stock will probably retrace soon. The problem with your trade though is that NVDA is not a classic meme stock that trades purely on retail speculation. It's an actual company making an actual profit. So the retrace may very well be small and/or slow causing you to hit max loss here.A put backspread is much more effective on a stock that is trading up but bound to fall off a cliff eventually, because there are no fundamentals supporting the price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 01:35:15'] Be aware that your trade will suffer in the "valley of death" - this is the range from 385 to 285. If you hold till expiry, your max loss will occur at 335.The best thing for this trade is a share price rise, or a quick and large fall. The longer you hold this, the larger your theta will be. So its best to get out with a small profit early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 18:33:20'] Ballsy trade. If it runs up you can expire worthless and keep your small credit. If it does to crash by around a third you are bleeding. Very interesting strategy. Keeps us in the loop on how this works out as I am interested.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 00:55:55'] What resistance are you seeing?  It keeps going up and up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 03:40:15'] Don‚Äôt ever double down on downside exposure in a fat uptrend/ bull market. Unless the entire market is at all time highs or Bear market rally. Those are both not the case here. Spy is still 30$ away from ath. Got plenty of steam to keep pushing. NVDA is one of the greatest tech company booms to ever happen. Money is flowing in like crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 00:55:02'] Interesting trade . Do you remember the deltas on that when you put it on?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 21:21:42'] Let me know if you lost money on NVDA. I am filing a class action on trading of May 24. Let me know Skipbecker1@gmail.com
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 21:31:53'] What is NVDA drops a little‚Ä¶like 10-15%?  It‚Äôs hard to use your numbers now because you opened it when it was like 380 or something.  If I model something similar now‚Ä¶perhaps it would be long Sept 370 P x2 and short Sept 420 P x1.  I like that it‚Äôs a net long vega trade, but there is a spot where the trade ends up losing if it ends up down like 1-20%
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 22:21:16'] I would‚Äôve just exited the entire trade for the small profit. It‚Äôs still hitting new all time highs and option traders keep piling into July upside calls with the 500 strike being the magnet. Frankly there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything at the moment that says NVDA or anything else in the semi sector should roll over let alone not continue higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 02:04:07'] Yeah but your losing money on the long putsInstead you could do a calender spread where you buy long puts and sell short puts month a partThat way your short puts will always pay for your long puts

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 15:46:10'] You‚Äôre not short nvda.  You‚Äôre short a call.  Depends on extrinsic value left in call whether u get assigned or not.  The deeper itm it goes the less extrinsic value no matter expiration. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt let it go below .10.  I‚Äôd just buy 100 shares to stop the upside bleed if I had the bp.  If it drops below your strike just sell the shares.  Preferably you want to buy the shares when your call gets breached. But better late than never.  It could go to 400. Who knows.  It can get assigned even if you have a long call.  Being part of a spread doesn‚Äôt prevent assignment on the short leg.  Buying shares is how you hedge a short option.  Or shorting shares on short put.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 18:04:00'] Earnings are coming could easily fall then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 15:27:08'] No.  This call has a huge $17.85 of time (extrinsic) value left.  If the trader exercised this call now that $1,785 would be lost . . .  The chances may go up based on the ER on 5/24 if the stock spikes and IV reduces the extrinsic value, so watch over that time.  Many don't leave options open over ERs as they can have unpredictable results.Read this to learn how extrinsic value works - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extrinsicvalue.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/extrinsicvalue.asp)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 23:00:57'] On May 16, 2023 at 11:53:57 ET an unusually large $1,214.90K block of Call contracts in NVIDIA (NVDA) was bought, with a strike price of $300.00 / share, expiring in 31 day(s) (on June 16, 2023). Fintel tracks all large options trades, and the premium spent on this trade was 1.80 sigmas above the mean, placing it in the 96.16th percentile of all recent large trades made in NVDA options.So yes I'd worry
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 03:11:19'] In short, yes, you should be worried about the 290 call being assigned.But you do have other options. You could cut your loss and close the position, as painful as it might be to do, you mitigate the risk of NVDA running even further into the money.If you have the means, you could buy another call with the same maturity but higher strike to cap the amount you can lose on this position but of course dependent on the strike, this could be quite expensive. You can still get assigned early on the short leg, however exercising an option early only makes sense in special situations regarding the dividend and amount of time value left. There is a div that goes ex 07 Jun 2023, although I am not sure how the optics of early exercise would look.You could sell some puts to collect premium and reduce your loss by collecting some premium, but this is a potential method for disaster as you're double short volatility.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:36:52'] In almost 22 years of trading I‚Äôve noticed about 80% of the time these big moves up are higher a month later but then give that back and half the move in the next 2-3 months. Call buyers get greedy and push the envelope till a big boy steps on them and they beat a quick retreat. My best guess is September/October Pullback we see $340 again. Until it hits that it‚Äôs a no touch for me other than Selling under $340 Puts. I‚Äôm looking at Selling the $325 if we pullback in a little big next week. Look at the insane amount of OI and Volumn at the $600 strike in next few weeks to months. I debated the 12/21/25 CCs at $600 for 63.60 but at current valuation high it could be $1,200 by then.

It could go up at $400 (currently at $390.22), and $400 is a round psychological level. From there I see it coming back down to 370-360 area in the upcoming months. Those who have been long will take profit and it's hard to buy now for many as they think they're buying at the top, which could drive the price further down. This is not financial advice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 04:05:27'] Extreme irrational hype bubble. Could pop tomorrow, could double again. A lot of people made this argument re. TSLA over 2020-2022, and got burned badly. George Soros has a theory called reflexivity ‚Äî that ubiquitous momentum investor mindset and FOMO (as well as bureaucratic issues such as fund managers buying NVDA now to show on their performance review that they bought the hottest stock in town, even though they didn‚Äôt make any money on the trade) create positive feedback loops fueled by leverage. The more people bid it up, the worse the hype gets. This will continue until something breaks ‚Äî eg, a binary event or bad earnings report. The lemmings‚Äô leveraged positions are forced to liquidate, then they have all this liquidity after the trade breaks, and jump back in, causing sharp rallies after volatile events. Markets don‚Äôt care about actual earnings right now though ‚Äî something has to shatter the irrational narrative that AI is going to generate billions of dollars in new market share value and that this is going to disproportionately flow to NVDA. That could take minutes or years. I personally have a long-term covered short position on NVDA, but I consider it a high risk play and have sized my position and hedged accordingly. Not financial advice, yadda yadda.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 01:27:08'] This is akin to TSLA in the last decade.  Ludicrous valuation yet makes only tens of thousand cars a year.  Toyota makes tens of millions of cars but valuation is below TSLA.Investors are banking on exponential growth from AI.  You cannot use linear extrapolation.  Valuation hinges on on big payout, but the probability is uncertain and borderline wishful thinking.  This is why there is a market for price discovery.  When things become more certain, the market will react.  But usually not in a good way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:28:59'] Sure, if you like standing in front of a freight train.All the reasons you state may be valid. The valuation is pretty insane.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 14:14:25'] Right now, best move is to stay as far away from NVDA as possible.  This thing goes up and down with big intraday moves with a well timed fart.The BETA in this is insane, and the market is volatile enough, without adding NVDA to the mix.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 04:01:40'] I bought 15 DTE puts yesterday 2 hours before the closing session. Can it go higher ? Yes. Much higher ? I really don't think so. M2 liquidity is draining, TA on NVIDIA I see a double top resistance. At 175 P/E It doesn't make sense. The bottleneck in AI is not necessarily the hardware but the software. Generative AI only needs high-compute power during the Neural net training, once it is trained you don't need nearly as much compute to run it for consumers. Also Meta will develop it's own in-house AI chip. Finally CUDA which is supposedly the main MOAT of NVIDIA has been open-sourced last year, other Chip manufacturers could simply use it as a base to develop their own chip interface.

Those bromides aside, if NVDA doubles it earnings in the next two or three years - not an impossibility - the current valuations will look fair.  NVDA has demonstrated an impressive ability to shift focus... adapting its chips from  gaming to supercomputers, data centers, automotive, crypto mining, machine learning and now, AI. NVDA could stumble, or economic conditions could derail the markets and NVDA, but the timing has to be perfect (lucky)  when betting against NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 15:03:25'] Nvidia is the only realistic GPU provider in the business. Sorry if you and I think their end user products are overpriced, our recourse is to spam Nvidia/Gaming subs, but businesses who live and die from doing researches don't care. They will buy Nvidia GPU is their consulting products rely on ML/AI. FOMO also has kicked in. People are pricing in cuts in Ameri-Canada. People are beginning to buy houses again. Why? Because they want to be the first to buy before cuts actually become the news. You are essentially banking on Powell not cutting this year. I reckon if he wants some credibility the first cut should happen next year around April/May. ITM puts is the worst you can do with something that could breach your ITM strike so soon. If this is a conviction play, go with 20% down OTM instead, like 280 or so, Jan 2024. Still overpriced as hell, but if you are right you probably make money by July.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 21:30:28'] Well, I was thinking a few days ago that a nice little call credit spread would make sense so long as I closed it before earnings. You know, thinking "wow, this company is super highly valued right now, surely any major bump at this point will come out of earnings." So I set up a nice little 8 point spread with 8 contracts. I can't remember the delta, but I was pretty far out of the money. Nice premiums you know, figured I was printing money.Then, about 10 minutes later NVDA started going up. And I rolled. And then I rolled again. And now my nice little spread closed the week about 5 points out of the money.With some luck this crazy stock will take a dive on Monday, but the moral of this story is don't fuck with NVDA. The End.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 23:34:42'] So I‚Äôm slightly regarded and use voodoo analysis to buy my puts. I own few 310p and 300p for June and both are down at least 15%. My 300p was rolled from 287.5 and already deep in the red. I‚Äôm thinking about hedging for earnings but that is to be seen. Same as you and as everyone else, I think it‚Äôs overhyped and overvalued, and unlike others here, I think there‚Äôs potential for disappointing words in the conference call even if they say AI in every sentence. My voodoo analysis consists of several factors - 1. Yes there‚Äôs an uptrend but I think there are statistical indications that it is exhausting - there are numerous bearish divergences on both weekly and daily timeframes; the rsi is getting too high and  I think the past few days have been way too optimistic. I use 2.25 sigmas on keltner for observations and everything that penetrates that raises and alarm for me. Voodoo, I tell you. 2. Their cfo sold stock just weeks ago. He wouldn‚Äôt give away millions. One director sold after him. This was march at 200, 230 and 275. 3. All ratios and multiples and industry comparisons are way too high in the stratosphere. 4. Option prices for earning expiration expect a c. 20$ move and protected butterflies are more than 2.1 for a 2.5 spread. This to me indicates high probability of ab outsized move. Yeah sure I may be (very) wrong and they can fly higher and destroy my summer plans and convert my Italy vacation with pasta, ravioli and pasta to camping with just bread and lettuce, but I think the recent higher buying was from more option participants which forced option sellers buy so they‚Äôre covered. The volume on Thursday was worrying for me. We shall see.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:43:54'] Because it's moving away from strike? June 16 is not a lot of time lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:56:40'] IVR is 2% according to TOS, so that has crushed the price.*Edit: Assuming it was a sold call* and provided the stock stays below the 415 strike by 6/16 the trade will eventually profit . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 11:11:21'] It's a combination of delta and vega.  About $20 of the move was the stock movement (1 point on a 20 delta option.)  The other $30 was a vol crush.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:05:54'] The replies are confusing. Did you buy the call or sell it? A covered call would mean you own at least 100 shares of NVDA. Do you?  And it's going down because June 16th is getting close. With every day that passes, NVDA will have to move further into the positive for the call to go up in value. When you're down to the wire, you'll find that *any* negative movement will kill the call, and even if the stock is flat or slightly positive, that doesn't mean the call will go up. It needs to go up by a larger and larger amount the closer you get to expiration because it becomes less and less likely that NVDA will hit your $415 strike by then.  If you sold the call, this isn't a bad thing. You'll get to keep the premium and your 100 shares of NVDA.   If you bought the call, then I suggest you probably cut your losses because the theta will crush you soon.

POST_TEXT: b"NVDA seems way overvalued with the recent AI hype, pricing a P/S of ~25 and P/E of ~150. This is absolutely madness and the upcoming recession riding on the back of inflation fears has made it difficult to justify this price. Hence, I'm thinking of buying Puts on NVDA but with longer dated expiration.\n\nHowever, I think NVDA will cross $300 in this month, fueled by a rally as CPI headline comes cooler on the 12th April. Which should lower the Puts premium. What do you think?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 20:34:42'] Beginner here. When trading options if I buy puts in this example and Jan2025 comes and NVDA Actually goes Even higher, is my potential loss JUST the amount I‚Äôm buying and turning into dust? Trying to understand the mechanics. Want to start trading with smaller amounts like $300-$500
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 22:39:01'] The plan is a bit numerically flawed, because of the following:A 4x to 5x profit that you're seeking, if you pay $3.5 for a 100P, occurs if NVDA falls to $80-86.  So it sounds like that's the price you're targeting.If you bought a 150P for $13.87 (today's last price), you'd get a 5x profit at $81.The reason you'd get a 100P is if you're envisioning the stock hitting a price much less than $80, such as $50.  That is when it returns a much higher multiple than a 150P.I am a fan of the thesis that NVDA is hyped up, and it will fall back to reality.  I'd be a bigger fan of the $150P if the target price was $10/share -- the idea that the stock would have a chance of proving itself to be a miserable, unprofitable, failing company that has no hope for the future.The problem I see is that NVIDIA ships a desirable product.  People want GPUs.  There are lots of reasons to want GPUs -- they're a general purpose product, and NVIDIA making enough profit to justify a $100 share price is very plausible.A total collapse in share price would be more plausible if there was a story where they got in direct competition with another GPU maker, like AMD, and drove margins down to zero.  But their product is not directly and precisely interchangeable.  A collapse in share price would be more plausible if businesses just decided, hey, they're giving up on machine learning, and self-driving cars are proven impossible, or the auto market has shown they will not use NVIDIA hardware/software in the future.I don't see a strong reason to believe that mindset shift would occur.  So I wouldn't buy the 100P or the 150P.I think if you do buy a 100P, you should be seeking a 10x profit or 15x profit.  You need a high payoff target to justify the purchase.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 20:00:06'] NVDA will go down when P/C ratio goes below 1
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 00:34:23'] Awful idea, I've been day trading NVDA options for the past 3 weeks...Theta is going to destroy your potential profit... I paper traded some LEAPs and you just don't have enough of a delta on them. Much better off with the few month puts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 05:40:18'] There‚Äôs no strategy in this, you‚Äôre just going against the trend. The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay hopeful for a crash.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 03:12:03'] Even if your scenario will prove right it is still not wise to wait such long time for such a return. Time decay will shrink your profits of your options. There are plenty other opportunities to multiply your money till then. Stocks can stay overvalued for long time. Nvidia rises on hopes and future earnings projections. When the first cracks will appear in their earnings you can think about going short.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 08:27:40'] Everyone talking about how it should go down probably means it won't.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 22:51:01'] The reason I wouldn't do this on NVDA is that people can be irrational with tech stocks and it could just keep going up regardless of how overvalued it is by our conventional understanding of valuation. And it's not like this is a bad business. It isn't a dog.But moving on with your plan, why would you buy so far out of the money and so far from expiration? Most projections of a possible recession suggest end of this year, but your put won't expire until January 2025.If this is a recession based strategy, I think the better question to ask is what stocks will be hurt the most in a broad-based market downturn? Banks? REITS with exposure to CRE? Insurance companies?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 20:27:03'] I would wait. Even NVDA does go down on April 12th. Unless it is a huge amount the 100P won't move much because there is so much time left on the option.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-09 14:30:06'] You are buying waaaaay out of the money puts and they are likely to expire worthless. Why not sell a vertical spread above the current price - so you sell, let's say a Jan 2024 300 call and buy a higher strike and just let the premium decay along with the price of NVDA. You cover the spread if NVDA crashes as you suggest. You should always try to sell option premium (extrinsic value) and not buy it. Selling premium is like swimming with the current, buying premium is swimming upstream. Selling the Jan 2024 spread gives the market a lot of time for the trade to work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:30:59'] I've been pretty much exclusively daytrading NVDA with small positions (<3%). It's gambling with the way these bulls hype it. Yet there's a a sizable contingency of a shorts and bears to knock the price down from its absurd valuation.Right at market open I've been having the most success when after hours mismatches the last close.I know from the 10-K that this is a ludicrously overvalued company, which trades at like ~340x revenue, and should see correction... eventually. But that doesn't help seeing as the LEAPS puts have a shitty delta and you pretty much lose out to theta. Probably not the kind of trading that anyone on this sub would condone. But I've been going off of market depth and SMA to make quick on the fly decisions about inverse momentum trades.$NVDS also has a shit delta to $NVDA.What is nice however is that the volatility means you can kind of hold on to small positions within your tolerance until they come back up/down. I've personally exited like 4 zoomers to 400% early.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:55:41'] Here is how my firm spotted it. We already had a large holding. Wanting to speculate on the volatility from the earnings call, we considered picking up more shares. We wanted to control 10,000 positions. That would have put 3,000,000 at risk, significantly more capital than were were willing to risk on that speculation. We would have been fine with a 5% loss, so we took 5% of that and bought out of the money calls with a June 2nd expiration.This way we significantly reduced the amount of capital we had at risk (in case of a major move) but still had that upside potential we wanted.We got lucky with how much upside there ended up being.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 22:28:38'] Selling calls around earnings is a generally risky idea. Sometimes you even get the news right but the stock does the opposite of what you think it should be doing after that news. Do you think the stock will remain this high indefinitely before expiration? Do you have enough buying power to wait out the volatility and time premium? A reason to roll immediately would be that you think this is the lowest it's going to be until expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:03:16'] > The Long call for the same duration looks to be more expensive. Is this the right reason to buy a bull call spread?This is always true because the short call helps mitigate the cost of the long call. A-B < A for AB>0. This in itself is not a good idea to enter a debit call. Apart from the classic "what do you know will happen in 3 years..." here is what:In this instance, you will keep 7000 of buying power just to make 23,000 that may not happen. This will not "mature" into anywhere close to 23,000 anytime soon, because the moment it spikes, the short leg will also increase in value. If you don't need the 7000 you can just buy shorter-term with similar risks/reward. A better way is to just go with quarterly or even 6-months ITM Leaps, selling calls weekly. ETA: Or if you are truly convinced, you could just buy and sell the legs at more reasonable delta, and then just buy multiples of them. You only make 23,000 if NVDA >= 750 on expiry. If they only finished 455, you lose money. If they finished at 535 you would have parked your 7000 for 20% gains. Almost three years for 20%... You probably can beat that easily.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 01:59:57'] This is completely equivalent to a cash secured put. You are literally reinventing the wheel.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 03:55:23'] If it works, you make 4% a month.  Projecting that out 12 months is wishful thinking.    During the October series last year, TSLA fell about 90 points.  Assuming that returned similar numbers as your example, it would take 3 successful cycles to make up that point loss.  But could you?    Suppose you bought at $300 and sold the $275 CC for $37.  It drops to $210. Your short call expires.  Cost basis is $263 ($53 loss).  Now you're either going to have to write a lower strike that locks in a loss or you're going to have to sell an OTM CC with a further out expiration in order to get enough premium to break even (60 days, 90 days?).  How many months does that take? This all works until it doesn't.    CCs and CSPs of the same series are synthetically equivalent.  Why do this in two transactions (stock + CC) when you can do it in one (CSP)?  Fewer commissions, fewer fees, less bid-ask slippage.    Wash sales are meaningless as long as you are out of the stock by the end of the year and you stay out for 30 days.    If you are fine with owning the stock at the net cost (stock price less premium received for the CC), go for it.  But risking money because the premium is high isn't the best choice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:29:40'] If you buy the shares for $196.48 and sell the 31Mar23 170C for $33.25 and share price is below $170 at expiration then technically your cost basis hasn't dropped.  You will have collected $33.25 on one trade and your account will still show a cost basis of what you paid for the stock, which, in this example, would be $196.48.For tsla to drop below $170 at expiration on 31mar23 it would require a 13% drop in value, which is nothing for tsla.  Just look at price change from 2dec22 to 4jan23 to 2feb23.  It went from $194 down to $108 and then back at $188. So it drop 44% from 2dec22 to 3jan23 and then rose almost 75% from 3jan23 to 2feb23.Never sell covered calls on stocks that you don't want to own.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 06:17:51'] The problem I see is you are taking on the downside risk of it dropping 50% but limiting your upside to 4%.  If you own Tesla you are taking on a good amount of risk you want the chance for a large amount of profit too.

Write the 11$ call.  They are out there.  Mostly on the stocks that have just had big moves.   This way you‚Äôre only on a 3 day period and there will be less time for a major move.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 04:07:45'] Another thing to consider is whether or not you‚Äôre using a cash account or margin account. While the return may look better using a cash account, it will look much different using a margin account. Just take a look at the margin requirements for both. The premium for the put is smaller than the premium collected for the covered call, but the margin requirement will be smaller as well. Return on margin capital will be very similar.

That's standard credit trading mechanics and can be accomplished any number of ways, most of which, IMO, have better risk/reward and other characteristics. For example, you could obtain a similar rate of return by rolling OTM short puts, only the puts should have less opportunity cost.> Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the "loss" of the shares).As long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, this is a non-issue.> There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.Yes, but that's true of all credit trading and/or delta-neutral strategies for selling overpriced vol. So not really a negative.> Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls).I understand why you think that, but it's basically not true. They both have the same downside risk on the stock side. In the ITM CC case, you got more upfront premium, but at higher risk of assignment with attendant higher loss of potential gains on the shares. In the OTM CC case, you have less upfront premium, with lower risk of assignment and lower potential loss of gains.> If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerablyThat's just a restatement of the previous "advantage".To me, the biggest negative about the scheme is that it is grossly inefficient of capital. There are more efficient ways to use that amount of capital or better ways to use less capital for the same risk/reward.

POST_TEXT: b'If I have 100sh NVDA and I sell both a call and a put with a 1/24 exp 280 strike, I collect almost $10,000 per contract. NVDA would have to be above 380 at exp for me to miss any upside and Im not a pig; $10k is plenty. If NVDA is down on 1/24, it would have to go below 180 for me to lose money, and Id probably just roll the put. So what am I missing?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 14:21:40'] >it would have to go below 180 for me to lose moneyYou are not counting your 100 shares. Downside break even on the total position would be about 230.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 15:49:47'] You‚Äôre not missing anything, other than having the correct breakeven on the downside. You‚Äôre selling a straddle and long shares. Your breakeven on the upside is 380, on the downside is 230 because of the shares. The risk is the same as ever‚Äîif it pumps way past 380 you don‚Äôt participate. If it goes way below 230 you lose money and either have to roll or possibly be assigned. Basically the same as doing the wheel you‚Äôre just using the same strike for both options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 16:35:30'] I wouldn't feel comfortable selling options on this long term. This thing was 108 a few months ago. It can easily go back there. My suggestion is to do 30 DTE. Things can change really quickly in this market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 15:41:56'] All very good points. Additional detail:  I have 1700 sh of nvda in my portfolio today, with an average cost basis of $210. I am not using any margin at this point, but I have a large amount of margin availability.  Yes, nvda is incredibly volatile. Last year I had sold 10 puts with a 145 strike and the stock dropped to 110, and I got assigned. Unfortunately I dumped those as soon as nvda hit 150. Dumb move. But this scenario does look interesting and I found I can buy a 1/24 185 put for $10 in case things go to hell again, leaving me with $9,000 per contract set. Appreciate the insights!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 14:41:27'] There are a number of names for that strategy - the one I hear most often is a "covered strangle".I do that strategy with weeklies or monthlies on a number of stocks.  In good times, it earns me a lot of money.  In bad times (like last year), I basically wind up rolling everything forward to out into the future.  (I'm basically right now starting to catch up with things I had rolled out last year when everything was tanking.)As is often pointed out on this sub, shorting a put is really the same - from a risk standpoint - as shorting a call.  And so a covered strangle is the same as simply doing two covered calls.The one advantage you get, though, is that it generally requires less of your buying power to short a naked put than it does to buy the stock.  And, of course, if you have $30k cash in your portfolio, that's enough to buy 100 shares without borrowing money, but not enough to buy 200 shares.YMMV, but https://imgur.com/a/3LjjUmC has the results I have gotten over the last three years with my mostly-covered-strangle account.  You can see it is far, far more volatile than the market as a whole.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 20:17:38'] if it dumps you lose on your shares and will receive an additional 100 shares because of the put assignment. Closing and reopening the put position doesnt change the fact you are losing money almost as fast as owning 100 shares. Not saying this cant work btw... Btw. If you dont hedge the short put with an otm put you will need to have capital ready to buy 100 shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 07:28:42'] I will buy that put from you.I too saw the crazy premiums on long term contracts but the problems are two fold.1) NVDA is uncomfortably overbought and overvalued right now. Most of the price increase is AI hype from folks that know nothing about it imo.Like 156x earnings.2) Selling the option that far out has a lot of theta, but you're nowhere near the curve of theta decreasing rapidly enough to benefit your risk. American style options can be exercised at any time, so a temporary dip/spike might just ruin your account (which has been happening every day).I think selling leaps is actually awful personally. I'm not sure how good buying them is either as the contract holds a metric ton of theta.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 10:37:05'] Sell the shares at this pump price and if you‚Äôd like sell the ATM CSP for 01/24 and let the market pay you to not be assigned, or retake 100 shares at a discount to current price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 13:33:10'] Are you selling a straddle or doing a collar (if you have 100 sh?) ‚Ä¶ the issue I had with NVDA straddles was that first this really stock jumps up and down, I never expected my straddles (Delta < 10) to be hit and they were hit hard every single time‚Ä¶ rolling is not as easy as you think , if you roll in a calendar spread it might not protect but increase the pain, lol‚Ä¶ if you roll in a diagonal, it might be costly or much extra time. Also, the margin required changes as you roll, also if your spreads are near stock price, your margins might be hacked up ‚Ä¶ then consider the margin amount held for 9 months, ‚Ä¶if you were doing the collar, then the 100 shares price action would have to be taken in account‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 16:17:17'] In addition to what others have said about your breakeven on the downside being higher than you thought, your post reads as though you think the outcome is a binary between 1) losing some amount of money, or 2) making $10k.  Don't forget that you only get to keep all 10k if NVDA is at *exactly* 380 on the expiration date.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 08:43:25'] If there‚Äôs a stock I‚Äôd expect to rise another 35ish% to 380 for whatever reason in whatever market condition, then it‚Äôs probably NVDA that is up 156% since the low in October.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 09:29:56'] Even if neither option gets ITM (loss for you) anytime before expiry, you should have funds to meet potential margin adjustments either if the underlying gets closer to either strike or if volatility increases. In both cases closing your positions would imply a loss and your broker would request collateral. If I were you I would have cash to cover your put sold, making that branch a CSP, the other one would be a CC.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 04:09:37'] You have 100 shares and 2 trades 1. Covered call with a strike price of 280 which is easy to understand for most people2. You sold a put at 280 which has the same profile as a covered call So your risk .reward is the same as if you bought additional 100 shares and sold a second covered call.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:05:39'] Buying short-dated OTM options across ER (especially the next expiration after the announcement) is one of the worst plays imaginable. The IV crush, except in rare cases, almost always puts your position into a loss once the ER passes, even if the underlying moves in your favor.If you are bearish on $NVDA, and wish to take a directional position, you could sell a call spread the day of ER, when the IV is likely to be at its peak.If you are just plain bearish, and don't wish to sell shares short, the next best would be a long-dated put that won't experience meaningful crush from IV compression post-ER.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:58:52'] I would advise against it. anytime anyone says they are going to invest in ai, nvidia makes money. they hold monopoly in cloud and ai GPU market. It sure is trading at high, but momentum might continue.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 18:32:22'] I used to swing trade it when it was $18-22 range years ago. Sold at $22 for like a $250 gain and have been waiting for it to drop back for like 6 years lol. A few years ago I had decent luck selling vertical spreads outside its general range wherever it settles after a big move. Premium is good but you're obviously at risk of any news moving it against you and you have to pretty much take off the month they post earnings. I would usually close positions at like 25-50% max profit because I didn't like holding too long. If it moved within a day or two of my entering I'd sometimes just take a hundred dollar gain and close it. I stopped trading it around COVID when it just became way too hard to predict. Took a few losses in a row and decided to take a break from it. Used to be like my goto option symbol for years but I haven't traded it for a while now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 03:57:08'] If it‚Äôs covered why roll it out at such a loss? Just let it exercise. Your underlying is up considerably
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:48:52'] You don‚Äôt want to sell‚Ä¶ stock has had a heck of a run up leading to earnings, you are entering last 6 weeks which means you benefit from theta decay more. Even if $NVDA beats and rises to 223ish, you still have time for IV to drop and your buyback price falling below..IV will drop post earnings, no matter what!!!! So benefit from it rather than selling now.  If you get called away, you made a decent coin + premium and then cash secured puts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 03:16:32'] It‚Äôs all about whether or not you have a better place to use the money. If not, keep rolling until you do.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 05:27:01'] You have to have  plan before you sell a call .  You have to know the price at which you are happpy to sell . I my case it is $480 a share.  If I am that lucky and I sell it at 480 I will buy it back hopefully cheaper with the next crash . I sold  a call while back with a strike price of  170 , bought it back at a lossthen I sold another call at 240 , if it hits 240 I will  buy it back and sell 300 callif it hits 300 I will roll it and sell 480 call and if it hits it I will get my shares called away and I 'l be more then happy with it .I don't think it will hit 480 in the next 2 years but if it does I'll be a happy guy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 10:04:44'] It really depends on specific math factors. I see a lot of people advocate for going at least 60 days out or 90 days out. It gives you time to be right and you can always sell before expiry which I believe is also recommended.I'm a moron though
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:50:26'] today the NVDA weekly $130P were up 230%+ and the March '23s were up 47%. If there's a huge bounce tomorrow the weeklies will probably lose 70%+ of their value and become almost worthless, while the March puts might lose 5-20% (estimation) depending on the size of the bounce
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 12:12:23'] The best way to return on something like this is to just short the stock.  A delta of 1 with no expiry and then sell OTM short puts to raise your entry basis.  Especially if you have a longer term outlook like a recession that can last months, if not years.  While you will pay a small % in short fees, you can let the stock do whatever, while you gather premium and artificially raise your basis, like an inverted covered call.  If you are targeting short momentum bursts (i.e. doing short term swing trades for a few days), you need to map out your target areas.  You can do this with daily/weekly/monthly lows, Fibonacci targets, longer term moving averages, crosses of indicators to signal that momentum has shifted on a shorter time frame (say the 4hr vs. the daily).  Since options can and will go to zero, you need to pay a bit more attention to your entries.  Unlike stocks where, as long as you have sized appropriately, you can theoretically let the sit on the position forever until it turns green, options have a finite window to execute and this is why most people have a defined magnitude or a certain % gain they make on the trade where they close it and move onto the next setup.  For example, I was short NVDA with a PDS from $163 or so with a target of $150.  I took my profits on Wednesday or Thursday last week with a 30% return on my investment.  Had I held, I could have effectively doubled my investment today, however, the future is unknown.  $NVDA could have bounced and turned that 30% profit right back to entry.  Targets are extremely important in options not to get awestruck by the possibility of 1000s of % return on $50-$100 input.

POST_TEXT: b'So I have 4,400 shares of NVDA at a cost basis of $212. Ive managed to reduce that cost basis by around $11.8 a share by selling covered calls so that brings my cost basis down to roughly $200. \n\nIm down quite a bit on this now and considering AMD beat earnings and the stock still took a beating afterwards, Im not very optimistic short term on NVDA earnings pump. I am however, optimistic long term. Not sure how long I would have to wait as this market can keep going down and NVDA is still not exactly cheap but theres hope lol. \n\nMy question is: how would you guys play this if in my shoes? Keep selling covered calls to reduce cost basis? I can sell CCs at my cost basis for decent premium a month or two out or I can sell shorter term CCs for higher premium at a lower strike. Or is there something else I should be looking at doing? \n\nThanks in advance for your opinions and thoughts!'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:23:58'] What percent of your portfolio is this 4,400 shares of NVDA? Your cost basis is worth about $880k which would be a lot for most people, most likely more than their whole portfolio. Unless you have a $5 Million+ portfolio I‚Äôd say you need to diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:06:49'] This is what going long feels like. At some point when you spent almost $1m on NVIDIA you should have hear the words in your head, 'I'm really fucking long NVIDIA' which should have made you think of a hedge against your longs. This is what long feels like. Short term ups and downs down bother people who are genuinely long. As you probably now know, you should have hedged at $212.  You still can, but it's not as pretty as you are 22% below entry price. **Hedge:** Sell the $200 October call for $17. Buy the December $150 put for $18. Sell the December $110 for $8.00You receive $8 in net premium. With the put, you are now protected from further downside at $150. **If Nvidia goes to $110,** your new max loss is going to be your cost basis of $200- $150 executed put + $8 premium which is a $42 loss. And you re-enter in December at $110. Better than $200 - $110 which is a $90 loss. **If Nvidia stays at $165** in October you just get kept $8 and you've also had insurance the whole time and you can ride it back up. **If Nvidia recovers to over $200 in October**, you are selling out at $200 via the call, but get to keep the $8 net premium and thankful that you rode out of it alive. You can adjust any of these numbers to your sweet-spot of risk/protection/reward by just changing the strikes. There are two fundamentals here. 1) You use the calls to finance the puts2) You are selling a put in later months (calendar spread) to help finance the purchase of puts in early months as that gets better premium and if you are long NVIDIA, re-entering at a new lower price in later months should not bother you. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:20:15'] Have you considered buying puts in the short to hedge? I own a few shares at $250 and I have been buying puts to make a few bucks here and there on down days, like this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:40:40'] I would sell weeklies at or slightly above your cost basis on green days. Even this morning, they could of been sold for 1.6 ish and bought back at the end of the day for .4 ish give or take. Which would of pocketed you a little over 5k and given you the option to repeat later in the week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:26:46'] I would sell 44, June 17, 2022 calls with a $200 strike - Bring in 30,000  Sit on the cash and prepare to buy back the contracts as time decays their value.  If stock goes up, be prepared to roll over.   IF stock goes down or stays flat, 1 - sell another 44 contract come early June. 2 - use the 30K to buy 175 - 200 more sharesThis is a great period in time to be selling covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:40:28'] Jesus you had nearly a $1MM in just a single company meaning you probably had couple million already in your portfolio. Why didn't you switch to safe blue chip dividend paying stocks and retire already?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:31:21'] Part of the reason it is going down is that it asked for a vote to significantly dilute the stock. Hope you voted. If that gets denied by shareholders, then it will probably go back up. I'd it gets approved, then it's going to be bad
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:56:53'] I‚Äôm long on both AMD and NVDA. This is the first I‚Äôve read that they‚Äôre trying to dilute their shares. If that happens I‚Äôm out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 13:23:38'] Selling covered calls is definitely a good strategy (and diversifying).If you are a risk taker, one thing you could also do is sell some NVDA, but then sell PUTs to get them back at a lower price. Though need to make sure to avoid wash sales. It is something I'm considering doing myself with AMD (I am low on NVDA, but have a large AMD portfolio).

Amd knocked it out of the Park on Earnings but the stock price didn‚Äôt move much and now it‚Äôs back down to pre earnings prices
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 16:55:39'] sell calls at lower strikes. It doesnt have to be at your b.e because the odds of it going there are low.ladder in. however, this is highly dependent on what your long term outlook is, but even then thats a gamble. The issue isnt that your position is bad, its that you have a large position in it, much larger than you are likely comfortable with.What I would do is sell off a portion that amounts to either break even or in profit from your covered calls. Dont look at the average of your total position, but the average based on a portion of your shares.For example, if you collected $5000 in premium from a covered call and your position is $10000, you can sell $5000 and you will be at break even.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:43:09'] Well, i have 6 shares of NVDA so you can take my advice as lightly as my position size (lol) but it seems to me two things: 1) youre overall position in one stock is probably too large and 2) since you are in it so largely selling CC‚Äôs to continue to avg down is not such a bad idea since it appears you can do so pretty easily. And who knows, at some point with this volatility we could see a short rally and you might be close enough to break even.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:52:31'] Sell the CC's in multiple OTM tranches.Utilize some form of "collar strategy."Use the premium for a split between long puts (to make profit if it continues to drop), shares (to average down), and short puts (to profit from time passage/also to average down).You have a literal money printer with that amount of shares and the current IV in the market.Try to sell the calls on green days or peaks of the day, and try to sell the puts on days like today.I'd lean more to selling OTM than buying shares, but don't be afraid to pull the trigger if you think you're catching a low. Try to buy the long puts when IV is low and sell to open OTM puts and CC's when it's elevated.  More shares will be more fuel to sell more CC's, time will take care of you.Don't stress about trading it perfectly (no one can time the call and put sells for the most optimal situation), just consistently do this and you'll be good.Just how'd I go about it, not financial advice.If you're selling the calls well above cost basis don't try to buy them back. I'd keep with doing that until you get a good feel and have confidence in going below cost basis and trying to buy them back.This can be as active as you'd like, or more on the passive side, once a week or month etc. Selling the OTM puts to open is more important than buying long puts IMO. But for sure keep the calls flying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:23:07'] If I were you,  I would sell calls on half the shares at a few bucks above the cost basis.   Not because I don't have faith in Nvidia but because $900k in a single stock is a little too much for my stomach.  When the shares get called away then I'll put that money in SPY/VOO via selling near the money puts (not all at once).
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 13:20:20'] Sell your shares, go on holiday for a month and buy them back when they hit $150. Then you can spend the rest DCA as the shares drop to $100. My god wake up people, look around you, the world is fucked and that is about to translate into the mother of all stock market collapses.Full disclosure. I hold no NVIDIA.Good luck fella
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 15:19:27'] Keep selling CC. The stock will recover. They just announced that LHR has been bypassed. So expect more graphics cards sold for mining. They did have to pay large fine to SEC for misstating they amount of cards sold to miners.   New 4000 series card will be released soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:11:40'] Sell way OTM covered calls every 1-2 weeks and relax
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:34:46'] The only time I recommend using covered calls is when (a) the stock is already at or above your profit target to sell shares, and (b) you don't mind giving up any additional gains.That is not your situation, so I would not risk missing the recovery phase by contracting to sell your shares at a discount to the market.Assuming I had dry powder in reserve (and you always should for just such contingencies), I'd load up on more cheap shares. DCA down to continue to lower your cost basis and be perfectly situated to exploit the recovery when it happens. Historically, many recoveries have their biggest gains in a single day up to a single week, so if you miss that day/week, you miss most of the value of the recovery. You want to be in a position to exploit every penny of that rise when it happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:42:34'] i'd sell the stock - take the capital loss and move on.  You will get another chance to buy at these levels IMO

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:12:28'] Sell a far out call - say Jan 23 - 180 strike (OTM), collect almost 30$ - that leaves u with a profit of 44k in the worst case scenario where your shares get called away.  worst worst case, is you collect the premium and still have the stock and your new basis is 170 after the stock has dumpstered even more.  I just picked this date randomly, but seems like like far out covered calls might be a good option.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:08:56'] I would write weekly covered calls ~10% out of the money and as it continues to fall lower roll the calls down and out to the next week. I you really think it has a good amount more to fall then buy the corresponding put to the call you write against the shares to construct a collar. 50% of your portfolio is a lot. Definitely consider the collar.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:21:49'] Long term prob just hold and continue to write calls bc due to volatility the premiums are very juicy - roll the proceeds from the covered calls into indexes

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:09:42'] Don't know what to tell you.  I also have a large position, at a higher cost basis than you.  My only saving grace is I exited all my calls at least in December and have just shares in them now.I can only hold.  The comfort comes from I've know they swing a lot more wildly then say a MSFT and I can stomach.  Also, they're going down a shit ton because it's getting caught up in the rest of the market.  Also they've done nothing but project upwards guidance and absolutely crush earnings the past couple of times.  With growing into more of a SW company vs. just a GPU HW company like everyone thinks they are, I am optimistic.Also If they had pulled, say, a FB/Meta on on earnings (where they crater like 25% in a day), then I'd be more worried, but that hasn't happened.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:41:38'] simp here. what is cost basis, ive heard the term being thrown around still not sure exactly what it is?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 22:17:12'] >I am however, optimistic long term.Then just wait!  NVDA is a good company.  They make real shit that we all buy.  Sorry you are in on a CB of 200...I think there is a reaosnable chance we hit 200 in the next 60 days as a bounce.  So don't sell calls right now...just wait.  and you'll be presented an opportunity to decide what to do.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 23:03:24'] I‚Äôd hold work and add to a different position given the sell off, this is a considerable amount and believe the company is going to be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 23:23:14'] Since you have 44 lots, you can probably sell really aggressive covered calls on a fraction of your position.Volatility pumps up calls too. So even if we rally you‚Äôll see some of the juice come out of these calls. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about shares getting called away, especially if you‚Äôre working in an IRA and dont have to worry about tax implications. From the looks of it, you‚Äôll have plenty more opportunities to replenish your shares at a much lower price
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 02:10:40'] NVDA still has a high multiple. If they earn $5 a share in 2022 then maybe $125 to $150 is fair market value. They earned $3.85 a share the last 4 quarters. I sold at $167 in 2021  for a solid profit and missed the epic run up to $320  Now we have higher interest rates and a nasty bear Market. NVDA May get back to $250 but it may take some time. Could be 3 to 5 years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 06:59:23'] Context is important. Age, savings rate, years until retirement might mean very different possibilities. Looks to me like a lot of terrible advice from young people with tiny accounts. These are the dominant group on this sub and half are gamblers not investors. Do not listen to advice from that demo unless you are saving a huge amount every year and have decades before retirement. Personally I would cut the position by at least 70 percent immediately. The rest you can do what you like. Number one rookie mistake is trading too big.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 22:53:28'] I think having a thesis and risk control metrics before entry is critical. In this case, defining the max size of the trade as a % of your portfolio, determining your exit point, and when you‚Äôd take profit to the upside. I also like to set a 5% move review where after a 5% up or down move I analyze the underlying and test my assumption. Hindsight aside, I think setting risk control is number one. After that, determining how you want to play things, you could try a collar to reduce additional downside - accepting the impact to upside, sell calls below your basis, etc.

You could do far worse holding a plummeting underlying trying to sell CCs.NVDA's P/E today is still shockingly high at 44 and these types of growth stocks are the first to sell off. Any stock where people justify it's valuation with future expectations of "artificial intelligence" is going to fall in these bearish conditions. The rate hikes are just getting started.If you're not optimistic short term but long term optimistic, why hold on to it? Repurchase the shares at a lower price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:00:06'] Get over the fact that NVDA is 50% of your portfolio.  You already did it to yourself, the next step is acceptance.You're only down if you choose to sell and selling now would be fiscal suicide as you'll lock in a 132k loss.  You're sitting on 44 contracts to farm and looking at the call chain, I'm not really sure what you have to be upset about.  Just farm them and continue to reduce your basis.  If you're able to get your basis within the striking range of premium of calls that are just ITM, start selling calls at that strike price.  If they get called away, whatever, you win.  You got your money back to diversify.  If the price drops and those calls go OTM then you farming fat premiums.  Play the long game for a bit, the premiums are great on NVDA, even with the IV plummeting.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:31:18'] We need to drain the swamp.  Amazing how governmental servants become rich in office.  Look at the candidates AMZN gives political donations to, while treating their workers like dogs.  As long as their contributions to the powerful government partners continues nothing will change.  We, the average men and women outnumber them - we have the power with our vote to change this.  No more allowing the rich to get richer at the cost of the working men/women who struggle to  pay their monthly bills, while politicians pretend to care.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:02:30'] Looking at the 1 year chart, it just seems like when $AMZN dips 200-400 points, people are buying calls. Doesn't look like anything nefarious.  My friend who is a degenerate gambler does the same thing, especially on a Friday if AMZN has been down all week.  Buys ATM calls +/- 2months and comes away with massive 5 figure gains. $NVDA , if she placed the trade when it was in the $500 range early May, would seem shady, but on 6/3 it was $678.  That's just a ballsy trade.

POST_TEXT: b'\n\nAfter the splits in June will own about 700 shares of GOOG, 800 of AMZN and 600 of NVDA (not splitting). My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan. \n\n\nWhat are potential downfalls to this strategy? I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each. If the price falls thats ok I still own the premium. Best case is that it missed the strike by $1, I keep the premium and the long position gains. \n\nThanks for any advice!'

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 20:38:00'] Think about it this way: Owning stock long term in growth companies gives you most of your return through the increase in the stock price. Those increases happen in ways and at times that you can't predict. They usually happen quite quickly. Lets say you bought FB in the past month at 188: [https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png)You figured it's basically a value stock at this point. You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. You made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. If you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. If you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. Selling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. There's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. The problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as "traders". YMMV. This is not tax advice or investment advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:36:29'] Alternatively, you could sell 3 contracts for GOOG and NVDA and 4 for AMZN at closer to 10% OTM. If the options get close to being ITM, sell calls on the other shares and buy to close the earlier contracts (roll up and out).
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 18:32:26'] First off, this is awesome - these are the exact posts I think truly help benefit the sub. People thinking through approaches well in advance and optimizing. Good on you. Onto your Q:>My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan.I think this is a great start to a plan but requires quite a bit more detail. It looks like some of it is implicit for you in your second paragraph but I'll mention some of the things I'm thinking about anyways in case you hadn't considered them:  \-Will you sell below your basis? If so, how would you deploy (how far below your basis, DTE, return requirements, etc)?  \-If not, is the plan to simply hold the stock? What's the downside risk management plan? Even if you intend to hold these forever, things change so it's still good practice to think through how you'd unwind in the worst case scenario.   \-NVDA pays a small dividend, does this factor into the plan at all?   \-Are you looking for any specific balance between these three? Rebalancing plans? A few initial thoughts for discussion, hope one or two of these may be useful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 21:10:23'] Problem is, when they run, they run.  I have/had four stocks I wish I never wrote calls on.  The run ups far outweigh what any premiums were collected.   The first was MSFT which was stuck in the twenties years ago.  I had about 500 shares off and on, wrote calls, sold puts, collected divvies, all good until Balmer was booted and replaced.  Then the stock went on a tear and I couldn‚Äôt keep up trying to roll the calls. Soon it was in the forties, then fifties, etc. Now $300 a share.   I bought 2000 shares of MOS about 3\~4 years ago after the sell off,  selling puts and calls when it was bouncing around back in the low twenties and mid teens.  I thought it was a really good trading stock for options.  The income was good.  Did ok.  Then it started to move.  Almost hit $70 recently.  I still have the calls in the low 30‚Äôs but missed out on about $80k of profit.  Had 1500 of OXY in the low teens and got called away in the low $30‚Äôs.   I have a $310 June call on COST.  It moved too fast to roll up.  Still hasn‚Äôt been called away, now collecting puny divs.  That‚Äôs almost $28k in lost profit.  Very annoying to say the least.  AMZN and Google I would accumulate.  Write puts instead.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:12:27'] Personally I would collect premium right now since it is so high, could prob collect 7-8k between all three for 5/20 .30 delta or less
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 21:00:39'] OK here it goes.  I would assume you are around you phone or computer full time to be trading options.April 29 Contract date (GOOG $3,100 strike = 21.00) (AMZN $3,700 strike = 30.00) (NVDA $315 strike = 5.76)GOOG - selling 7 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $700 per month. AMZN - selling 8 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $1,200 per monthNVDA - selling 6 cc's will bring in $3,420 per monthSelling 1 GOOG or AMZN cc will be a giant waste of time.  Take some more time and learn and practice selling covered calls so you feel comfortable selling all 7 or 8 contracts.   You will need some liquidity, but here is my opinion.Sell the April 29 contracts with strike as noted above.  Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date. If stock trades sideways, the time element is on your side. If stock drops, you can but back your contract for a bargain and repeat. (or just let die worthless and do again)  As long as you have liquidity, you can continue to roll over. NVDA is a different animal. Due to it's volatility, this stock will bring in premium.  Again, as long as you have liquidity, you can sell cc's and roll over those calls should the stock price rise substantially.  If trades sideways, you buy back cheap and repeat, or hold until contract is worthless.   I honestly don't worry about being assigned.  If the contract goes in the money, there's no guarantee you will be assigned.  I neve have been. I recently have a June 17th $150 call trading at $185 and I just bought back the contract for $5,500, pushed back the strike date a month and sold another for $5,500 increasing the strike price to $180.If, for some reason you get assigned, just buy back the stock. If you let it get to a spot where it's well over your strike price, shame on you. The downside is, you are a long term holder of stock. So pick companies you believe in for the long run.As for BABA situation, hopefully people were selling calls on the way down. When it rips up 30%, you roll over.  Remember, each time you sell a contract, you put premium in your account.  And each time a contract expires, that premium is yours. You don't always have to be ITM, as long as you have the liquidity to roll over. Roll over on the way up, take premium on the way down
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 02:34:55'] Worst scenario the stocks drop.. But You get downside protection since you have been selling those calls otm..2nd worst scenarioYou gotta sell those stocks at a higher price you bought them.. + a premium ( This is like an American with 1st world real problems such as no siracha left in the fridge) of course you can avoid this by daily tracking and rolling...
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 05:10:26'] ‚ÄúCovered calls are technically a form of shorting‚Äù.  Ill exaggerate - but is this short some of the most innovative and long term high growth stocks that have ever existed?It‚Äôs a lot of work to mitigate issues for dinky premiums.  Take notes and choose wisely so you can wash rinse repeat long term and limit damage control.  Keep track. Spread sheet, etc so you can learn and see if it‚Äôs working. You can paper trade them now to see what happens. Come up with a plan. Significant move up - are you committed to allowing assignment? Stock drops - are you going to later sell covered calls below your CB? And let them assign?Rolling‚Ä¶?Rolling eats up gobs of time, profit or makes you sit on zero gains for months. As premium goes up - yes longer DTEs are valuable but so is the one you have to buy back to roll out of.  They‚Äôre often equivalent so you‚Äôre just baking the initial dinky premium into a much longer time frame and higher cost for a strike that still might get surpassed. These might be dumb numbers but as an example:You sell a CC for $100 premium. Significant run up happens. Buyback is $500 and roll to a higher strike takes 6 months and a $550 premium for a $50 credit. You‚Äôve now got $150 of CC premium but the CC is valued at $550 so you‚Äôre down $400 and hoping it doesn‚Äôt keep running.  keep track and make sure what you‚Äôre doing is working like you think it will.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 17:23:30'] A bear market can rip your portfolio apart. When the big bad bear arrives is anyones guess. However it is mostly a when question not if. If it is Ursa Major a person might be looking at a decade to get back to break even. The premiums for those calls are likely to be modest. My wild guess maybe 2 percent in premiums per year. That‚Äôs a lot capital. The strategy would have been terrific going back ten or twenty years. Going forward? No one knows. Please understand that the leaders during one bull market may become laggards during the next phase. That is more common than the same leaders for many decades.

POST_TEXT: b'Nvda has earnings next week. Would you avoid selling/holding puts on AMD up to and after NVDA reports?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 13:25:21'] I'd sit on the sidelines and watch.  If AMD gets hit and drops below 90, I start looking at buying calls.  Bought some Jan 82.50 calls earlier this year, would love a chance to buy some more / longer term ones - but only for the right price.Regarding puts, I'd avoid those on AMD right now.  Stock seems a bit range bound and you'll probably end up having puts expire ootm or for minor gains if it drops a bit.  Either way, not a good risk / reward scenario.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 17:15:40'] My whole trading strategy is to look for the mistakes of others. NVDA front-ran their earnings, but rallied like mad with the rest of the market. I think that was a mistake. Its been a bumpy ride, had nearly the worst entry imaginable, but my puts finally were about $50 shy of breaking even this afternoon.NVDA will announce shitty earnings because they already told us they would. It will drag down all other semis, and it will take about 2-4 weeks for the market to sort out which semi companies are still growing like mad and which have some bumps ahead.When the smoke clears, i think we can scoop up AMD for $90, maybe $85 a share and get a solid run to $120 before the end of the year. Good chance NVDA starts trading at 30x earnings and AMD trades at 35x.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 15:34:22'] Competently cultivate clicks and mortar technologies.. Buying or selling options before earnings is generally beyond most peoples risk tolerance. Earnings are likely to be particularly less relevant lagging indicators for the sector considering the sector focused fiscal activity. This will probably somewhat mute even a negative print in my opinion. Corporate professionally commences commerce with alternative spirits to intrinsically maintain dynamic ROI.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 06:00:25'] I would hold puts on nvda, their earnings are probably going to drop. with the crypto crash and a new chipset release in a couple months there is no real drive for their product right now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 09:09:38'] Sell that shit for a loss and move on. Sometimes with options its better to accept the L early and move on to a new trade before watching your contract go to zero. Market took a huge hit and im expecting to see more red on monday and through the week. Only saving grace you may have in this one is NVDA earnings on Weds after market, you may be able to get some IV pump to bring your contracts back closer to breakeven. Just my 2 cents!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 10:10:20'] You could roll down by using the following strategy. I‚Äôm going to use this example with 1 270 CallSell the 270C + an additional 270c for a total credit of 9.50Then use the 9.50 to buy a 252.50c. This establishes a spread. This will limit your profit potential, but will significantly lower your breakeven point. Your new breakeven will be 261.25 with this strategy and you maximum loss will be still be the initial 8.75 since no additional capital was used to roll down. This strategy is only a better alternative if NVDA rallies above 257.25 (252.50 + 4.75) by Feb 25th. Otherwise  it would be better to just take the loss and sell your call for 4.75.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 11:23:51'] Ok. Here is the solution. Sell your call on February 16. Do this ten minutes before market closes. If you wait longer, you will lose more or make money. But that‚Äôs gambling because no one knows what the stock price will do after the earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 20:24:09'] You haven't told us the critical pieces of information needed.What is the total amount you can put into this trade/afford to lose?What was your trade thesis upon entering? Did you intend to hold through earnings?Are you able to day trade freely? AKA are you well above the $25k threshold?You used the 25th expiry, so you have time here- earnings reports have been crazy lately, AMD gaped up big after they reported. There most likely will be an IV increase this week.I think you have a potential winner here, or at least several escape routes. A lot depends on the results of the Fed meeting tomorrow.Either way it opens tomorrow, I'd immediately sell 4-5 $272.5C's. You seem to have lost conviction  and this will give you some extra capital to average down later if needed.I'm imagining a worse case scenario where these calls drop to .01-.02 a piece by next Monday, you still throw half of what you recovered from selling the $272.5C's into averaging down and come out with a profit it it recovers a few percentage points by next Wednesday.What are you using to visualize these scenarios? I like [optionstrat.com](https://optionstrat.com)I'm going to play along this week pretending I'm in your position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 15:21:10'] You can turn it into a butterfly and get back some of your losses.  You already bought one so you sell 2 and buy one.  Or sell 3 and buy 2 if you think it‚Äôs not going go up.  They have earnings on 16th.  You bought one at 270 so you sell 2 at 280 and buy one at 290.  Whatever that credit would be would offset your loss on the single one you bought.  Your protected both sides. If it goes up the 270 280 will cover your 280/290 credit spread.  If it goes down you keep the credit.  If it goes up to 280 you make another 1k then lose 100 dollars of that for every dollar it goes above 280.  So if you turned into a butterfly you would collect about $400 in credit.  So instead of losing 875 you‚Äôd only lose 475 if it doesn‚Äôt go to 270.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-13 16:07:39'] This isn't as simple as it sounds, sometimes a loss is just a loss, BUT, the question of whether you think NVDA will head, especially considering earnings are coming up? If you're still bullish on it,, you can offset some of the risk by selling a higher value call (you need to be approved for spreads by your broker). If you're not sure the market will support NVDAs move up, you need to look at unwinding on a green day. Earnings should be nice, but NVDA had a high beta, so it's fairly sensitive to market movements. If the whole market is sht, then it shouldn't fare much better, regardless of earnings. Goodness forbid the earnings are not stellar, it will be crushed. So again, you really have to decide whether you think the price is going to move this week. You're somewhat far on the weekly range, so don't take anyone touting the stick or putting it down in reddit seriously, but make your own decision.Not advice, just some ranting!

I dont think closing OTM will protect you from after market moves since I read you can exercise until 1.5h after market close on friday.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 16:33:10'] I show NVDA at 178 still so you "should" be ok.  If someone really wanted to exercise they would have to manually do that AH.  It doesn't look like it fell that much that someone would make the money off it.  They have 1.5 hours after close to do this and it does not look like it got to your strike.  You really should use this as a learning opportunity.  Never get yourself it this position again with a risk this high.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone, last week on wednesday (when the price was $235) I sold my first ever covered call on my Nvidia shares, with a strike at $272,5 expiring this friday on March 25th. After the amazing rally last week where the price got real spicy for me (happy and not happy at the same time haha), I'd like to initate a roll on my covered call to prevent my shares being called. I was thinking about waiting to friday morning and buy back the call and sell a new call 2 weeks out (in the same transaction), maybe with a strike of $285 with an expiry April 8th. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo just making sure the new call covers my transaction fee. Advice welcome, please take note that I'm canadian and using questrade, so it takes 1 day for me to convert CAD to USD so I have to take that into consideration if I have a negative balance. Thanks!"
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 18:43:07'] Wait til another day or two.  May never get to 272.50You have a few choices‚Ä¶1.) roll it out and up.  Longer date and higher price2.) close it out - lose money buying it back3.) if the price drops this week - buy a call at like 275 - this is protection.  Then  if you get assigned your trading platform will exercise your call to cover the assignment4.) buy the stock at 272.50 or less to cover the assignment
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 18:38:55'] If your call gets exercised just sell a put at the same price as the CC

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 08:34:43'] I'd buy back the $272.50 call and sell a 2022-04-08 $280 call (2 weeks and increase of $7.50 in strike). You'd net $1.85 credit. Alternatives could be:* 2022-04-08 $275 for more credit ($3.90) but more likely to end ITM.* 2022-04-08 $285 for less credit ($0.15) but more likely to end OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 16:51:15'] You get the most money from rolling when you're as close to the money as possible, as late as possible. But it's much more profitable to be on the money and early than of the money and later. In other words, current price matters much more than timing. So with only 3 days to go, if you see it touch your strike, roll immediately.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 19:50:27'] Assuming your cost basis is lower than $272.50:I also think you should do nothing. Decent chance it doesn't close above your strike price, and even if it goes above $272.50 before Friday, there is no ex-dividend date event this week so little chance your shares get called away early. If it does close above your strike come Friday, just give this volatile market a day or two and buy back in even lower next week (since your account is tax free). If your cost basis is above $272.50: I would say avoid this scenario, but it's not like I haven't done it a million times myself...so just roll it up and out until you get a credit for the transaction!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 20:11:54'] I would probly close the covered call since investor day is tomorrow and just wait to see where the market takes the stock before opening another covered call on the position. There‚Äôs been massive call buying up through the 25March 280 strike plus the QQQ closed right at the $350 resistance line. If it breaks that resistance we‚Äôll be at $357 fast and that‚Äôll take up NVDA and the rest of tech
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 20:39:05'] I'm not a fan of rolling personally, but if you do roll then you'll likely want to wait until the day before your call expires to roll (march 24th.) However in the future don't sell a call at a strike you would be unhappy selling the share for. If you do take assignment, just buy the shares back on monday with your stack of cash with a buy-write since you can't use a CSP.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 21:10:22'] I have sold covered calls before then rolled them only to see the stock price go down after couple of days and I have essentially lost money in this rolling business as I bought back the call at much higher premium then I got. So...I would say let it get exercised if it gets called. Why are you trying to hold on to the stock? If you're bulling on the stock then just buy it again when you see a dip. Lock your gains!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 05:35:40'] Do ya feel lucky?  Well, do ya punk?  1) Roll it out now and the stock crashes2) Keep it, and the stock crashes3) Keep it, and the stock moons4) Roll it out on expiry date.Depending on my mood, I usually do 4.  Minimum pain threshold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 11:55:47'] Honestly, I usually wait until the sold premium is all but gone, that is late in the day of expiration. If the spread isn't crazy, I'll buy back the option and sell another a week or two out. If the spread is terrible, I let it get called away, take profits and look for another trade. I don't fall in love with stocks or trades.

Question for the experienced here, should I be conservative and sell it for some small profit here before the Feb 16 earnings report, or is there reason to feel secure that it'll jump up and give me solid returns right before it expires? I won't lie, I dont have a ton of money set aside for investing and I kinda yolo'd a large percentage of that on this one call. I was sweating when it went in the red for a good while right after I bought, but its doing well now. I didnt go cheap, I bought what was just barely OTM at the time and I thought 255 was a very reasonable goal. Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 21:46:55'] https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/IV/  I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt exactly perfect but it helps. Your basically buying at an IV that is 23% higher than the 252 historical volatility (59.8 IV vs 48.4 HV).Usually you would want to seek when IV is one Standard deviation over HV (16% in this case I might be mistaken could be tho). If you are that bullish calls. If you want to play iv crush maybe a spread or something

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 14:06:08'] SPCE for me in May 2021.  It's been awhile but I got in around $28 and sold at $32 because it stalled for a few days at the 200 EMA on the daily.  I figured, whatever, I made a couple hundred, lock it up.  The stock hit a peak of $59.xx.  I think my stop loss was less than $2 at the time, so it would have been up at one point close to 15-16X at the peak,  which was huge for my meagre account.  Such is life, I still made money so not overly mad at it, but yeah.Back when I was actively day trading penny stocks there were quite a few I would sell for a loss only to have them be up huge in the afternoon or a few days later. I did have an epic win on $WIMI once though.  Got in around $9 and then it short squeezed up to like $15 where I sold for a nice $8500 profit.  I got back in around $21 and held 100 shares over the weekend and sold them on Monday morning when it gapped up and made another $1000.

Went down to about $5-$10 on Wednesday, so when it went back up to $35 on Thurs I cashed out worried it could expire worthless the next day. Contract got up to $7000 before close yesterday. So I left $6965 on the table, about 20000%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 02:47:34'] Only one I got out too early. CLOV June, 2021. My $1.00 call went to $6.00. seen it rip pre market. Health Care stuff always drops when the market opens. Made $500. Literally 4 months into trading. I'm a genius. Had I held, would have made another $1000. That's my worst. Now, here we are and yesterday SP up .24%. I said watch it rip over 1% to go into a holiday weekend. It did. My justification for NOT playing, I do index fund investing with about 65% SP 500, 35% small/mid caps. I'm getting those gains, so why Gamble and get greedy.

Big event misses/early profits like NVDA can hurt but just try to force yourself to focus on the next one. It becomes more natural with time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 10:48:58'] Buy 100 shares of nvda (27k). Sell a call at 300 strike against your shares. Best case you keep premium and shares. Worst case, you get your shares taken at 300 for a 3k profit and keep the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 09:14:12'] Sell to close when it hits your profit target you should have established before opening the trade . . .Exercising is rare as you lose some of the time value.Edit: You should also have a loss target to close if the trade starts losing so you don't have a full loss.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 09:07:48'] Are you telling you just bought $22k of call options with zero hedging and no exit plan? Is this a small part of your portfolio? I hope so because you are playing it like a YOLO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 09:04:35'] $22,000 on your first option tradeNot bad for a first trade but earnings can kill your options due to implied volatility You would need NVDA to be trading over 292 to break evenSince you have 10 contracts, I would sell some at 30%, 60%, 100%, and keep only 1 or 2 as runners for earnings. This is if the stock moves in your direction. The market can chop thru March until the Fed raises rates. If you hold all 10 contracts thru earnings, well that‚Äôs just WSB. Could be glorified gains or terrible losses
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 10:19:58'] Top three rookie mistakesTrading too big. CheckTrading without a plan. Check.Trading illiquid options. PushUnless you have a seven figure account, way too big. Many suggest a 3 percent to 5 percent of the account limit for any one position.You need a plan for up down unchanged. Way too many rookies focus 90 percent of their plan on a big move in their direction. The reality is this might be the 10 percent. You need to have a solid plan for unchanged and down before getting in.There is a chance we are all being trolled, looking for extreme reactions. Yawn.If not a troll, I suggest taking $20k and playing only with that for a year, doing one contract trades. Keep a journal, take that year to learn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 10:39:26'] When playing earnings announcements, you have to be aware of the IV Crush that will often tank the option prices right after the announcement, even if it is favor of what you expected.  In this case you also very little time value left (only two days) after the announcement.  So essentially your options will be worth only a very slight bit more than than their intrinsic value if you hold until earnings.So my play here would be to ride the lead up to week of the earnings announcement and then sell at least half or more to cover your initial 22k and maybe take some profit and then you decide to hold or exercise the remaining ones at expiration.  Of course this all assumes your correct on the stock prices' movement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 23:50:50'] Don‚Äôt hold until expiration. Unless the underlying shares consistently go up a little every day, its premium will decay. NVDA is a very liquid option. I trade it regularly. You should have no difficulty exiting out of your position at any time. As others have said, scale out. Sell 3 contracts on NVDA‚Äôs next $5 up move (happens almost every day at some point ). Do it on the market‚Äôs next green day and secure some profit for yourself. Then do it again on the market‚Äôs next 1% green day and you‚Äôll have 60% of your risk off the table with some sizable profit to go along with it. After that, it‚Äôs up to you. Sell 2 or 3 more on the next market green day after that and hold 1 or 2 and sell what you have left BEFORE the last close PRIOR to earnings. That‚Äôs what I would do personally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 09:18:35'] If the options prices go up (meaning that they aren't yet priced in regarding the earning) due to the earning approaching, you could sell some of the options to lower your break-even before January 25th. While I am no expert I wouldn't recommend selling Options with less than 30 days to expiration due to the theta decay acting faster and bigger 30 days prior to expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 12:10:39'] You'll be fine. Hold until NVDA hits $350 and think about selling. If this run up is similar to the last one, we should get there. You should already be up 10% if you purchased at $22. IV shouldn't kill you because you are in the money. IV should go up if NVDA spikes so your calls would be worth more.  If you can risk this money, I would hold for the next (4?) few weeks. But also continue to learn more about options. The worst thing is that if this plays out well, you will continue to take even more risks until you loose way more. So don't do that. Good Luck!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 17:32:44'] I do believe Theta will be knocking on your door long before you need to worry about taking profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-13 02:21:26'] If you are playing earnings, it's not about whether or not it will go up or down after earnings. Its a out how much price movement is built into the spread. If you think the price is valued inaccurately, underestimating volatility, then be on the buy side. If you think it is overestimating I'd be on the sell side. Also, consider on earnings reports, doing a ratio backspread to cover the downside more. Then if you lose its mostly because the stock didn't moves in price, not that it went the wrong direction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-13 03:53:14'] If you‚Äôre playing earnings then just buy the day of. No point in holding onto these for weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 16:52:35'] I suspect the debt ceiling won't get resolved until after the market gets scared, and both parties have found a way to declare victory for their side and yet how to blame the other side for something. This is too good of an opportunity to set a battle line for the 2024 election. Neither party will let that chance pass them by.After the debt ceiling deal gets signed, the market may be happy for a few weeks. Then it will wake up to the mofo big liquidity drain and Tbill supply dumping on the bond market from Treasury as it fills the coffers so it can pay bills again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 20:01:57'] It's all noise at this point. Stock market value is basically part of the money supply from a psychological perspective, and that's what counts. If it goes up too much they'll have to raise rates again, if it goes down too much they'll do something to prop it up to avoid recession. Directional bets are basically betting on which way the room temperature will go when it's being controlled by a thermostat. You can look at the outside weather and listen for the ac to kick on etc... but big picture there's still a thermostat.

Also, I know why $ADBE premiums are so high, but for them to be this high 9 days before earnings is very odd and I am wondering if anyone knows the exact reason?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 08:57:58'] The only way the Apple VR takes off is with an ADBE killer app.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:21:55'] ADBE vols don't look that insane to me. Right now they're at about 40% IV, which is actually on  the low end of historical vols around earnings (45%+). The IV Rank/Percentiles are also only around 35%, so again, not that high or juicy.Just be careful with those bid/ask spreads, they tend to get pretty wide on ADBE when things really start getting volatile. Speaking from experience.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:10:55'] When it comes to earnings I view it as there are 4 options:1) Buy ahead and ride the IV wave and sell prior to earnings2) Believe earnings will beat the implied move and hold3) Short movement/earnings (Iron Condor-ish)4) Buy options following IV crush and tap into the post earning volatility, with a lower entry price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 08:57:20'] yea, awhile back NFLX 0-4 DTE had ridiculous spreads, even near underlying price with lots of OI and volume.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:39:06'] Adobe has a habit of making left field announcements a few days before earnings. Straddle prices for the last 2 years have routinely jumped by more than 10% in the 10 day run up to their earnings calls. That's probably why.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 11:46:25'] The implied move isn't actually that crazy for options expiring the week of earnings. The implied move is around 7%.Movement for the previous week's of Earnings (most recent -> 1 year ago) \[Open Monday vs. Closed Friday\]. Obviously, there is intraday movement. Looks like, 2 beats, 1 50% miss, and 1 near 100% total miss.P1: +8.71%P2:  +1.12%P3:  -23.41%P4: -4.39%  Like all earnings plays its a binary event and you usually look like a genius or an idiot. Based on those number, the pricing is probably about right.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:07:32'] It's a large underlying with fairly wide markets.  Not really my cup of tea. But yes, agree- high premium.  Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 17:12:21'] Doesn‚Äôt look very expensive. But I‚Äôm not at my computer to look at IV rank.One of the ways I explained to a friend when looking at options of $4-500 stocks (he was appalled by the premiums) is to just imagine it‚Äôs a $100 stock and do some simple math on some contracts. Ex. the 6/16 450C is 7.65. That‚Äôs a 4% move. Now let‚Äôs just divide by 4 to get the stock closer to a hundred. But we‚Äôll also do the same with that options premium, and we get a $108 stock with an option that cost $1.9 for a 4% move expiring post ER. That doesn‚Äôt seem bad. If we look at the 6/9s that don‚Äôt cover the ER, pricing seems pretty normal. An AMZN contract 4% otm expiring this week cost .2. An Adbe contract 4% otm cost .84. But remember adbe is almost 4x the cost/share. So just divide by 4 (basically think of it as if they were to do a split). Adbe would be $108, with a .21 contract for a call 4% otm.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 09:31:22'] You talked me into a trade. BOT 4 OCT 600 Calls, sold the Jun16 400C. I figure ADBE around $470 should maximize my loss after earnings. Expect that.

I bought a leap for NVDA well before the stock split, and now, after selling off 2/5 of my options on the way up, I have 3 left. They are NVDA Jun17'22 175.0 Call(s).  \nNeedless to say, it has been gut-wrenching watch NVDA step lower and lower over the last month. I have lost 50% profits on these calls. Don't ask me why I didn't sell when NVDA hit 330. I just thought I had time, and each few days, NVDA stepped lower. Now that earnings are smashing the market (sorry NFLX) it feels like NVDA is suffering a similar fate.  \nThe only silver lining is that they are still very profitable considering my base investment. My question is now, what do I do? Do I roll the options up? Do I hold onto them since they are less volatile than OTM calls? Do I just give up and sell it entirely?  \n  \nReally appreciate everyone's insight."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:22:00'] good thing you are paper trading. the strike price you sold is 372.50, or, you are selling 100 shares for $37,250. This is well below your cost value of 100x406.38. However, you received a premium for selling the contract of $3465 ($34.65x100). Strike+premium=$40,715 is what you will have after you are called. Minus the $40,638 of what you paid for shares, you are left with a $77 profit. That is about .002% profit from $40k. You would earn the same amount every 2 weeks on a 5% CD,

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 06:24:04'] Let's do the math . . .Bought stock for $406.38 and opened a covered call with a strike of $372.50.  If assigned, and the odds are very good as the stock is well above the strike price, then this would be a loss as you will be paid $372.50 per share - $406.38 cost = $33.88 loss, or $3,388 per contract.The option side of the math is a $34.65, $3,465 premium collected which is all kept if the option expires.The net overall profit is the $34.65 - $33.88 loss = $0.77, or $3,465 - $3,388 = **$77 net profit before any fees.**There is a slightly higher chance of being assigned earlier, but will most likely be assigned at expiration.Note that the reason the profit is so small is that this is so far ITM.  An **ATM CC might have brought in a profit of $1,500 or more** as the extrinsic value would be much higher.  The risk would be that the shares might not be called away and the stock dropping would always be another risk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 16:48:12'] So you're paying 1.4k and holding 5k margin for a breakeven at 254, with a max payout of 10k for anything above 340. If NVDA shits the bed, you're out 6.4k. A little worse than 1:2 risk reward, but I don't know that that's necessarily terrible. I'd personally probably take profits on this trade off if it was worth 5-6k. Question is, where do you put your stop? You could easily be down 2k in a month if NVDA settles back around 230 or lower. Also the chain is super spready all the way out there Jan 23, so good luck getting filled at a decent price, both getting in and out. Overall I like the trade structure, but I think the spreadiness makes it tough.

Like the other reply that noted that the bid was 419.38 for less than 10 seconds, less time than it takes to enter or adjust an order.If (a) the bid was above your cost basis, and (b) you entered a correct limit order to sell to close at the bid (for example, if the bid is nickel increment, you set a multiple of $.05 as the limit, not $.69), and (c) the bid stayed at that price or higher for the entire time your order was put together, submitted, and went live, and (d) the quantity of your order did not exceed the quantity of the NBBO, it's very hard to believe you would not be insta-filled. All sorts of things would have to parlay to have your order hang fire, like some higher priority order got in front of you and took all the quantity at that price, if not swept the entire order book.

The broker doesn't sit there and watch your trades, deciding whether to allow them to fill or not.  On low liquidity options, they typically only trade in .05 increments.  Sometimes you can choose a different exchange which will allow the penny, but not very often.  There is some detail on this, but you'll have to look at the exchanges to see what they say about it.&#x200B;Lastly, your comment about being rarely profitable, blowing up your account, and having to add more money -- this isn't because of your broker.  It's because of what you are doing.  Stop trying to scalp trade options.  You are the person making the trades.

Backtesting is nice to look at, but what happened in the past is unlikely to happen in the future, so these tests are of little real world value.As with most long trades getting the market direction and move right is required, and since no one can predict the market accurately over time this is a very hard way to make money . . .

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 13:15:31'] People always overestimate downside risk. The reality is that just because something has moved up quickly doesn't mean that it's going to reverse direction at any rate similar to the move up. That's going to have a huge impact on your position as it decays. Especially when you start looking at the current put/call skew You're taking a very large monetary risk compared to a normal month or week. Things are very stretched and extended right now. If it were me I would look at a much more Delta neutral position that I could skew to the downside if that was my thesis but something that would help give me coverage if it comes back.Just my two cents.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 12:08:10'] You have to calculate EV: (probability of winning x amount you win) - (probability of losing x amount you lose). If it comes out positive, it‚Äôs a winning long term play.Now of course getting those probabilities is the tricky part. You have to model the stock based on all the variables that actually influence the price movement. It‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, it‚Äôs pretty much what those math PhDs at trading firms do. There are many hidden variables and many more seemingly important but actually not important variables. A simple backtest is a pretty crude way of getting those probabilities, as the error bands are enormous if you take the final probability you extracted and and test it with individuals stocks.Now here‚Äôs the kicker, once you do all the work correctly, you realize all options are priced slightly out of range of positive EV. That‚Äôs because the pros already crunched the numbers and sell at a profitable spread to them. You‚Äôll just be gambling if you do get in the trade. You‚Äôll never have the statistical edge.

I would then allocate only 10 percent to spreads,  and then 5-10 to buying calls/puts , or hedging your portfolio. Spreads are the hardest to manage as if one thing goes wrong, your back at one.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 09:05:42'] I been trading credit spreads since beginning of the year, I have 3 years' experience trading options.  Took an IRA account from Jan 1st 36k to today 163k, just trading SPY played a bit in SPX (better contract prices but the bid/ask is so wide, you basically have to wait for day of expiration to get out).  I have the same concerns, about losing it all, so what I have done is I set my max amount used for colleterial is 120K, worse case I lose the 120K, it would suck but I still have more than I started with.   I roll any spreads in the money at least a day before, or even earlier if way in the money.  I also try to collect 20/25% return on the money, but I am also going max 10 days out.  SPY almost did catch me last week when it spiked up over 420, had a lot of 416/417 calls so I just rolled them out, either for a small credit or small lose.  I will just make less money for that week, recent avg have been10k a week, this past week only 2k.  I been playing it close on the call side, sometimes I add puts sometimes not, sometimes I add the puts the day before if I get the strikes and premiums I want.  Right now, with this debt limit mess been very cautious when doing the put side.  Never been exercised on the call side even when over 10 dollars under, but I have been on the put side, before I really knew how to handle them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:20:57'] Your 90% success ratio is consistent with what you‚Äôre modeling with Black Scholes. That means you‚Äôve fallen in the dead center of the model‚Äôs probability density function. But if you‚Äôre taking a 20% profit on a 90% probability trade, sign me up for that, all day every day. I would expect to see ~10% profit on a 90% probability trade. Options held to expiration are mathematically a Martingale. There are strategies, however, that have a much higher probability of showing profits prior to expiration that take trades away from an even expectation. So you can consistently profit with options by managing your winners and losers appropriately. Given that, your concern should be about how you mitigate losses with the 10% of the losers. But honestly, if you‚Äôve got a 90% probability of a 20% profit, even if your 10% probability ends up with an 80% loss every time, you‚Äôre going to end up winning and you should be focused on getting as much volume as humanly possible.

POST_TEXT: b'A week ago I sold iron condor on NVDA 205/215/225/235. And of course NVDA closed slightly above 225, so I ended up with short 100 at 225. Well, as everyone know NVDA is above 300 now. Earnings are coming in 2 weeks. What are the chances that NVDA is going to retract back to at least 250 mark? Or should I just bite the bullet and close position with 8K loss?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 06:03:08'] Not advice, just personal reflection:If it were me, there's 2 options:1. Close it now and watch NVDA crash back to about 2122. Hold it and watch NVDA fly to 400
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 06:29:50'] There is no dilemma. You phuked up. Take the loss and move on
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 14:37:30'] I closed position and ate 8k loss. Lesson learned.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 06:38:59'] If you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll go up much more you could do a reverse collar. Buy an OTM protective call and sell OTM puts, rolling them like you would a covered call.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 14:32:49'] I think there will be an NVDA pullback, and I've been bullish on NVDA and cashing in on them for a while now.With that being said, there is like no chance NVDA sees 250 again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 20:51:48'] Sorry for your loss. We have all been there. Couple of opinions: I don‚Äôt sell Iron Condors ever, and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt sell one on a high flying tech stock. And if I was forced to sell one, it would be at .09 and -.09 delta spread. Also, look at the chart. NVDA was definitely in a bullish trend. Condors only work with sideways movement. I‚Äôm looking for confirmation of a pullback and it might come Monday. It‚Äôs overbought right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 11:56:06'] You should have cut your losses $7k ago (just saying for future posterity, if you're wrong about a direction then stop-limit your loss and move on to the next idea)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 01:45:07'] I personally don't think Nvidia will go back to 250. There are two major catalysts for price movement in coming weeks, one is the GTC AI conference that is happening next Tues (9 Nov) where Nvidia is expected to announce the launch of new products, The 2nd earnings announcement that is coming up on 17 Nov 21. These 2 events are likely to keep Nvidia pricing at its current state or push it higher. We have seen how AMD good earnings call has pushed it to the current price of 136. So it is likely that Nvidia will announce good results that will further cause the stock to go upwards.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 09:03:54'] Also keep in mind NVDA has an event on Tuesday, 11/09 announcing new products. The current theme running NVDA is the metaverse. If they announce metaverse related products expect an even higher run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 06:29:02'] I think when you're at the point of asking the internet for advice, your best off closing your position. That goes for gains as well as losses.  Don't look back at what could have been, but focus on what happened to you and use that as a tool to learn. One other piece of advice: Before you trade options like these in the future, write down what your acceptable gains/losses are and where you'll pull the trigger on either side if the stock behaves unexpectedly. Be ruthlessly disciplined about this. Every time I have violated my own rules, I've ended up getting burned. My personal rule is that it doesn't matter on the upside how high I think the stock will go or even if it is on a mission to Mars. I cash out at 100% profit. I've missed out on 200,300,and even 1000% gains before, but you know what? I took profit at 100% and never had one turn around on me. On the flip side, I exit based on loss velocity rather than on percentages, though percentages can change my mind. It's complicated, and it's hard to explain, but I use a sort of mental calculus to track accelerating price changes - especially negative ones.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 06:14:43'] It depends on which series you did this and how much margin you have. If you have margin sell cash secured Put or bull put spread to attract it down NVDA rallied due to possible tie up with Meta. You may consider buying it as upmove will give you money in the underlying and a crash if any will give you profit in your condor.

POST_TEXT: b"As I do here each week, here's a look ahead of some of the moves expected out of notable earnings. \n\nMy thoughts: It's interesting to see the much smaller expected moves of companies set to report this week (towards the end of earnings season) as opposed to what we saw a few weeks ago. That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \\~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.\n\nLet me know in the comments if you'd like to see anything added.\n\n**Last Week**\n\n* VIX closed Friday at 22.05, down slightly on the week and the lowest level since the Spring.\n* Last week's expected move in SPY +/- 1.2%\n* Last weeks actual "

If there was a volatility spike, that would be a different story. It's at  38% now in ToS after a major slump from 50% recently.On the other hand, you can use the low volatility for a strangle. With recent earnings move of -8%, 0%, 0%, may also not be a great idea.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:58:29'] Another way to look at it is from a new risk/reward perspective. What you stand to lose has gone up by 35% and what you stand to make has been reduced by the same amount. Is that new risk/reward worth it to hold for the remaining 29 days? That‚Äôs a call you have to make. Personally if I could make 35% of the max gain in one day, I‚Äôd call it a day and look for other opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 14:06:49'] The issue is not with trading options per se, but rather the lack of risk management, and trading far too large a position size relative to your capital. This is extremely common, and many, many people have blown up their accounts due to these issues.I did this myself a couple of times in my early years of trading (many years ago), until I learned that these are actually among the most crucial elements in being a successful trader.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 14:10:41'] \[being stupid playing with options\]First, you have to admit to yourself you were gambling in either how or what you were trading to lose this amount in such a short time.  There are many ways to trade options with defined or limited risks, but you either don't know how to do this or went with undefined risk strategies to cause this high of a loss in one week . . .Unless you know what you did wrong and how to trade in a way that won't make things worse, then it seems you have to quit or you will continue to gamble.  You will feel worse if you turn a 150K loss into a larger one.I've been suggesting to many new traders to read an excellent book titled **Trading in the Zone by Douglas**.  In this book he talks about emotions, discipline, planning and having a winning attitude.Download the book and read it this weekend as I suspect you will have a different view of things come Monday morning.Candidly, many new traders lose their house payment money gambling on options, so you are lucky in that you have a great job and high net worth, and at your age have plenty of time to make a lot more money.  Not your finest moment this week, but you will get past it and move on.  Just don't make it worse if you don't know what you're doing . . .

Consider yourself blessed that you even have 150k to lose and that making it back with your salary won't take long.My advice would be, pick a couple low cap projects that have good potential and HODL before the bull run starts.Grab a couple of the big names in crypto who are down quite a bit from ATH and HODLIf you like to get into meme coins I wouldn't put too much capital into those for obvious reasons.

Take some time off from options and maybe your day job.Then one day you will realize you still got your high paying job, a bunch of savings, and a roof over your head, life is not so shitty after all.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 14:13:42'] First, don‚Äôt buy options but sell. Wealth building is step process. Learn about charts, news for particular stocks, sectors and macro & micro economic conditions affecting that sector and over all (like careful during fomc, cpi print days etc). If you really believe the stock go up or down then try spreads or sell options (opposite side) & use that proceeds to buy the directional trades.   I said slow process, because just earning 4% per month (very hard to get this) will get you 50% gain. Option buyers spoiled by instant next day gain of 20-30% and assume its easy. Also, once you win or lose a good trade take a break. Clear your mind. Don‚Äôt look back on losses or runners you let go early. Also, learn about taking profits and cut loses with set targets (very hard to practice). And, remove emotions from the trade, meaning the stick continues to moon or crater. Thats where your learnings help. Its ok to lose $$ but try to learn something from this experience. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 15:36:34'] Are you trading short term contracts? I have learned to never play anything less than 25dte and those I hold for 2 maybe 3 days before I cut losses.

If you trade say 5k batches of options and close at 10% profit just twice a day is 250k a year (before taxes).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 15:53:25'] Everyone has had some tough patches. What I would suggest is really reflect on when you made money and lost money and whether or not that was luck whether good or bad or you thought you had an edge. If you come to the conclusion you were gambling and it wasn‚Äôt asymmetric, then I would suggest you use that as justification to stop. Or at least minimize your amount you will use options. For example, use 10k instead of 150 for trading and the other amount for just buy and hold assets

Also diversifies your portfolio because you will need more than 5 stocks to trade so you have to do a lot of DD. This will benefit you longterm if you learn from it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-01 05:43:47'] Apart from what has been mentioned already, it's important to note that corporate actions (like stock split) may affect the liquidity of an option. Post stock split the strike will be adjusted and can become a fractional number. In that case many big players (like pension funds) lose interest in that particular option and rather use options with non-fractional strikes for their hedging/passive income purposes. That can lead to widening of a bid-ask spread and as a result a worse exit price, although that should be a lesser concern for LEAPS.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 12:23:17'] Fairly new to this so hoping someone can provide some more context. From everything I've been reading the general consensus is that debit spreads are better in a low IV environment. When we are talking about a low IV environment, I assume we are talking about VIX and /VX, correct?My general understanding was that in a low IV environment such VIX being this low (it hasn't hit under 17 since January of last year), the market, in general, is more susceptible to a bounce or bullish trajectory. Why would it not make sense to utilize a bull put spread in a low IV environment? Why is a debit spread better in a low IV environment? My understanding is that you want to open debit spreads in a low IV environment and hope that IV potentially increases. Wouldn't it make more sense to open a bull put credit spread instead?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 06:08:32'] Theta decay that helps short options like CCs profit ramps up over the last 60 days, so it doesn't make sense to sell so far away.Looking at a 49 dte 305 CC would bring in about $8.65 or $865.  Assuming the above example could be traded every 45ish dte for about $850 each time it would bring in about $7650 over the same time as the JUN 24 call (that you found out you have to hold to expiration to make the full profit).  Trading every 45ish dte will also let you move the strike price to move with the stock instead of locking down at $305.  If the stock moves up slowly then the CC strike can move up with it.  This can mean a lot more profit if the stock price moves up to $350 or $400.CCs is all about having theta decay work for you and the best way is to not sell past about 60 dte . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 06:05:53'] Dude. Exercising an option that you *sold*? The fact that you don't realize how absurd that is is proof that you need to stay away from options, at least until you understand the basics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 06:24:41'] Everyone is being hard on you because you are misunderstanding the fundamentals. I believe what you are asking is ‚Äúcan I get out of this position earlier than June 24 if NVDA continues to climb‚Äù. The answer is yes. Not by exercising, that‚Äôs the wrong term, but by ‚ÄúBuying to Close‚Äù the option you ‚ÄúSold to Open‚Äù.   Effectively you would need to pay the premium you received originally (and likely much more, making this a losing trade) to repurchase and close the option contract you sold. Selling extremely long dated contracts nets a big premium because the extrinsic value values the anticipated growth of the underlying. It is not free money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 04:52:22'] If you sell a call,  you don't have it and you have nothing to execute.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 05:32:14'] The owner of an option has the right to exercise the option. He/she paid a premium for this right. You, as the seller, received a premium for selling this right.If this is a covered call, then you would not be able to sell your NVDA shares (100 shares) unless the short call expires or is bought back. As you realize, the short call would expire in June 2024 so that is a very long time.If you have a margin account, you may be able to sell your long NVDA shares and keep the short NVDA call position on. However, you would have to meet margin requirements to do this. Note that the broker may increase margin requirements at any time.It is best that you increase your understanding of options before you even do something like this because it does not look like you truly understand options at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 05:44:37'] If you *buy* a call you exercise early to get *more* shares. When you sell an option you are getting paid for giving someone else that right, so you do not have the ability to exercise - although you do have the risk of them exercising early and your shares being called away.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 10:15:06'] Do you mean you want to buy the 305 call and not sell? If you want to own more shares at 305 then you buy the 305 calls. Yes, you can exercise early if it goes ITM before expiration but it‚Äôs not advisable since there will still be time value. But if you want to use your 100 shares as collateral, then you sell the 305 calls.  Yes you can close it out early by buying to close.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 12:39:43'] You cannot exercise a short call. It is the buyers option to say they want to buy it at a given price at or above the strike. I suppose they could do it when the price is trading below the strike but that doesn't make sense unless there is a dividend upcoming that would be more than the difference in exercising below the strike.  You can certainly buy to close at any point regardless of the price it is currently trading at if you want to get out while you're ahead or cut losses.Since you have 100 shares at a nice cost basis you could sell shorter dated CC closer to your cost for smaller premium but do it more frequently. If the shares eventually get called away you've made a nice profit on the sale and all the premium you've been collecting. If you want them back you can start selling puts for premium until you get assigned.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 18:18:01'] Don‚Äôt do it you lose time value just sell to close and buy the stock if you want to own the shares, if your broker doesn‚Äôt know this, change where you trade

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-15 14:13:59'] Well, Nvidia is not gonna make any CPUs you can put in a PC, so not much competition added there.Anyhow, Nvidia already has a big stance in AI chips which they are gonna extend. Same with HPC on GPUs and now CPUs as well. At the same time they are going to lose market share on the GPU front with Intel now starting to compete but overall bullish I‚Äòd say.Intel trying to claw back trust and attacking consumer GPUs is interesting. If the rumored benchmarks turn out to be true and the price right, that‚Äòs gonna be interesting to watch. AMD feels a bit sidelined at the moment. Not able to keep up with raytracing performance of the RTX, nobody cares about OpenCL for deep learning and their consumer GPUs aren‚Äòt available to jump into the gap the RTX shortage created. Plus their ‚Äûprofessional‚Äú GPUs are just embarrassing. HBM2 is nice and all but workstation GPUs with a max of 8GB VRAM? Please...They‚Äòre gonna do good on desktop and server Ryzens, though, so maybe slightly bullish?Qualcomm, I have no idea. But I guess as long as there‚Äòs Android phones, they gonna make money. Which good for Nvidia cause licensing. So double bullish I guess.^^
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-15 16:11:56'] AMD pretty safe here, buy under 80 sell 90-100.  Great products, Great CEO, but production constrained will never allow them to beat Intel forever.  No dividend and pretty high PE....NVDA 700 Price Target will likely be hit but not much short term upside here.  Best company, best CEO, best tech, will likely hit 1000+ in next 10 years.  If they are allowed to buy ARM this is the google/amazon of chip stocks, meaning you can not fail.  Sell your house, wife and kids to buy this stock and come back to it in 10-20 years....QCOM very safe here, has a monopoly in cell phones pays a good dividend if things dont work out.  Long term is a bit more questionable.  I'd take AVGO, SWKS and QRVO along with QCOM to hedge your bets long term.INTC crappy product vs AMD but that usually doesnt last long, new CEO should get them back on track + USA fabs gonna start doing foundry work, they print money even with lesser chips....so a bit high here, i'd wait for a pull back but limited up and downside, fairly valued plus pay a dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-15 15:30:46'] NVDA is playing their cards right. They're not gunning for the consumer cpu, they want the big data crunching, AI learning market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-15 14:26:38'] AFAIK the constraints are elsewhere. ASML and TSMC are the ones that actually manufacture chips or provide manufacturing tools. Europe is the battleground for China vs the US in the chip department as the Dutch ASML is the one and only provider of fabrication machinery. While manufacturimg supply crunch exists, design companies like AMD, INTC, AAPL, QCOM and also auto companies will continue to suffer.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 07:11:08']    Intel post management changes and redefining their strategy in a era with a increased reliance on chips has the best upside risk/reward. This is a company that has been left for dead due to missteps and execution issues, but still is a significant player in a the CPU market as well as adjacent business including FPGA, AI, autonomous, 5G. The last five year revenue trends have been a record each year despite the world is ending thesis on Intel, yet the price underperformance and the hatred on the stock has maintained. While it may not have the limelight that other semiconductors get its a undervalued and potential momentum stock on the cusp of turning. New management combined with financial strength can highlight the reality that Intel existence is not on the line rather individual investors perception of the company is misaligned.In addition, the product delays and node delays that get all the attention are very specific and case sensitive benchmarks. This does not mean there are performance questions that need to be addressed in the long run and with a technical focused management team and reliance on more customized solutions this can be addressed. The old days notions of processors simply being all about node size has evolved as many customers and clients look for customized solutions with integration into adjacencies including memory, gpu, fpga, AI which Intel has a portfolio to address. This also, includes other performance aspects including the packaging designs that Intel currently leads. To the average user they will not recognize the node their processor is running on or even how many cores it has (despite having a sticker saying dual core on their laptop). Also, Intel has always led in transistor density making their nodes on the "same level" as other competitors nodes a so called "generation ahead". In reality their 10nm performance is equivalent to competitors 7nm but the industry has evolved tremendously and a lot of other factors can impact performance. However, under new management hopefully a return to pleasing developers and the gamer community with events, and new products will return. This may help to blunt some of the negative press. It is also, important to note that the markets Intel operates in have a large and growing TAM often times and as a result there is room for competition; it is inevitable. Even Apple with a decades worth of the great unquestioned leadership in smartphones has competition and does not hold 100% of the smartphone market. After years of playing defense the other areas that Intel operates in have been grossly overlooked due to their lack of credibility with product delays on the CPU front. These include many bets in areas where the so called "high flying innovative tech stocks" operate in which include AI, machine learning, 5G, autonomous vehicles(Mobileye), FPGA and GPU. Intel has been and will continue to play offense on a lot of these fronts , but many investors do not care or highlight this since its always about nodes and nanometers. Despite being overlooked, these are the areas that can and will drive future growth and enable a lot of these technologies to work together offering customized solutions for clients. In return, it is critical from a stock perspective to see this as a opportunity to reassess the company and its valuation.

The VIX closed the week slightly higher but also saw large swings, nearly 30 on the upper end and 22 on the lower end. Last weeks volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-16 09:38:54'] I'm riding that train with you. The bounce for NVDA next week during/after the split will be huge IMO, I'm thinking in the range of 15-20%. So, for your sake, and mine, I think it is important to keep talking about how the price will be favorable for new investors to gain positions on NVDA. Shorts paid off on the predicted dip near the split, now it is time for the predicted bounce. REMEMBER, all the Long Callers for NVDA put their price targets in the range of 900-1000. Not to mention, NVDA is a solid company working on every front to expand and maintain production, even with chip shortages. History repeats...there is always a dip near Splits, at least for NVDA (they have had 4 of them), but the bounce back will happen much more quickly with NVDA this time around. There are a lot of heavy hitters that are about to take advantage of this recent dip. We should just enjoy the ride and take the gains!One thing I've learned from NVDA trading, as small-time retail, is that I must be willing to endure the huge swings in price for their options because NVDA options ain't cheap!

This is an ok trade that most people can modify selling spreads or  doing what you said. Nice simple risk management for the majority of people here. I think everyone here don't really understand the risk that they are taking with most trades , and I hope they understand if they are somewhat wrong on the entry they can really lose their shirt on this trade. I would say just because of an experienced trader saying this is OK,  it might not be best for you or your style.

POST_TEXT: b"so I have 1120 shares of amazon at $159 a share and I'm thinking of selling calls and puts to slowly start making my money back, now I've sold covered calls in the past but in all honesty, I don't know what to honestly do."
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:00:09'] Covered calls at $159 to begin with and as you make some money back. eg. 1.00 from 1 contract you can lower the break even price to a CC for $158 and collect more in credit and keep doing it.  Keep experimenting with it and to ensure your profitble my hard rule is selling CC at break even price or above. Another tip, when VIX is higher Volatility increases and so price of options increases which is ideal for CC.  I would  sell CC at varying price and varying times which means I would not enter int 11 contracts in 1 trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:04:26'] when I've had similar situations,  what I've done is start a call ladder.   Sell 1 call, 6 weeks out,  and each week sell another, until you have 6 covered calls.  By only covering half, it gives you some income, but in the case of a sudden spike up,  you could avoid having shared called away by rolling 1 call for 2.  I've been doing this with SHOP
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:31:09'] For starters, selling anything close to your cost basis will yield only a penny or two so not worth it.   If you are up for a little risk, 30 days out and around 110-115 you can get $1 so 10 contracts will yield about a $1,000.  That‚Äôs actually helping some.    If for some reason it really starts to run you should be prepared to roll up and out or let the position go for a loss and maybe wheel it if you want to stay in the position long term with CSP‚Äôs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:43:40'] You have $178,000 position in AMZN, and your asking for advice on Reddit? Just roll the dice man. Seems to have worked pretty well for you so far. Best bet is sell cc‚Äôs just a bit OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:29:11'] I believe that AMZN is too far extended to the downside for this particular quarter. I would ‚Äúrinse-cycle‚Äù them‚Ä¶. begin selling calls at strikes at least 1.5% above, weekly, then writing cash covered puts a strike or two below until filled. Yes this means you have to finally accept realized losses,   But at least from that point forward you‚Äôre increasing your balance. Don‚Äôt let FOMO stop you from making money. üí∞
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:35:47'] If it were me,  I would hedge a percentage of the deltas (for me 25-35% if I were bullish and 50% if bearish).  So you have 1120 long deltas sell short dates 7-14DTE at .30 deltas,  then just roll them weekly.  If you see the stock rally add another call at the same strike until you are hedged to the tune of around 25-50% of shares.   You can buy them and sell them at your pleasure since you own the shares!  So for me it would be more about hedging all that long delta even if I was green in the trade I would still do this.  If I am red I do it more aggressively.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:09'] First and foremost, you need to decide if you are bullish or bearish on AMZN. Your past loss really doesn't matter. After you figure out your trade then decide which options are best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:44:26'] Sell the 30 delta calls against some of your stock.  Maybe 1/4 to start.  remember, if your stock gets called away, you can always sell puts and keep going. If the stock gets called away, it's not game over.  it's just part of the game.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 13:51:36'] What is your net stock cost including any put or call premiums you‚Äôve collected up until now?  Or, did you buy 1120 shares outright and paid $159 per share?  You‚Äôre saying you‚Äôve sold CCs in the past, how much has this collected?Ideally you‚Äôll want to sell CCs at a strike above your net stock cost in case the share price spikes up and they are called away.  Read this for more info on the mechanics - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 14:32:44'] Sell 30 deltas with the dates staggered so weekly to 90 dte. The whole selling above cost average is for the birds. Your job is to generate returns not hold on to your sunken cost bias.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:43:35'] I have a good amount of money in Amzn too. Not nearly as much as you though. I bought 22 shares at 143. I‚Äôm holding steady. If it drops below $95 I‚Äôll buy some more shares. I‚Äôm really looking at QQQ to make a decision. It‚Äôs been flirting with 315. If it does and holds‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a good sign for tech stocks. If it drops back down to 300 then I see a recession coming. Feels like speculation is boosting the market up. I don‚Äôt know if it can work long term. Aka fake it til you make it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:11:51'] Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Meaning, don‚Äôt plop down 1000 shares and sell 100 covered calls with one expiration date at one strike. Start with one covered call (100 shares of stock) and learn as you go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:27'] I will not hesitate to sell some consistently on a green day.  Selling cc cover at a lower price is risky.  For each contract itm you lose -$6K.  That is -$66K for 11 contracts.  If you paid way under 96 I would recommend cc for income. Even that is full of risk. I also read others comments but that sounds more risky.  Your current paper loss is a concern.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 17:22:28'] A covered put is short shares and a short put.  Is that what you mean?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:48:56'] For selling puts, are you bullish in Amazon? Are you willing to capture more shares if you were assigned Amazon at worst case? If so, what price? You‚Äôre going to picking up pennies if you sell covered calls on Amazon. Sure you can sell cc at a strike lower than your cost basis but is it really worth the risk of getting them called away and lock in the loss? If you‚Äôre no longer bullish about Amazon and just wanted to get rid of the stocks, then sure. Sell CCs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 21:09:57'] I bought a few hundred shares about 2 weeks ago at ~$99.  Did 1 buy write expiring this coming Friday for $101 ‚Ä¶ received $280 for that.  I think the price will get close to that by this Friday.  I‚Äôve been watching a lot of indicators ‚Ä¶so check those out before entering a position.  I‚Äôm watching for a run up to write a 4/21 contract and roll my other contract.  Also check out call open interest to see what expectation is ‚Ä¶and also watch the daily call volume ‚Ä¶and remember Amzn earnings coming next month ‚Ä¶might see a run up.  I use Barchart and the Barchart app. I bought Amzn pre split for $120 and sold for $150 last year and have been waiting since then to jump back in.  I sold CSPs 4/21 $90 a few months ago thinking I might get assigned to no avail so I just decided to buy the stock ‚Ä¶but received some nice premium on the puts.  Maybe sell some puts when the stock takes a dip to receive some more premium and lower your CB.  Put call ratio for 4/21 is .48 and the trend is up. I agree with others to sell a call or 2 (after a run up‚Ä¶even if it‚Äôs only to $102) then wait and see.  Pay attention to a possible pre earnings run up.  I‚Äôd choose .25 delta or lower in case there‚Äôs a good run up and you have to chase the call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:02:00'] I would not sell CCs on your shares, since the current price is so far below any reasonable strikes. If you sell CCs at say 110 or 115 and then the stock shoots up past that, you will regret having them called away. I think you should examine whether you believe amzn has good upside potential right now or you think you can utilize that capital more efficiently. If you think they are better opportunities, then sell and move on. If you think it can go back up to your cost basis, then hold. But selling any CCs below your cost basis has the chance of locking in a real loss
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:06:02'] Just reading your replies and not trying to be an ass, you need to dive a little deeper into options fundamentals and understand better which position your taking vs it‚Äôs outcome a little better before dicking around with a $100,000 position. I mean, even if Amazon is your only position you‚Äôve got about a 6 figure portfolio so obviously some fucking around money available to you. Give an actual financial advisor a few bucks to talk you through this shit one on one and nail down your specific goals.Edit: $109905.60 Fuck what Reddit has to say brother, go seek professional advice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 07:31:26'] With amzn, isn‚Äôt it just easier to sell SPX calls since it‚Äôs such a big part of market? And European style settlement is so easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 09:23:42'] I agree with some comments. You'll first need to determine if your macro bias ..is bullish or bearish on Amzn & why U entered the trade (beside making $$). What's your time horizon for this trade? ( long or short term ). You scaled into Amzn w/avg price of $159 now, your bias feels slightly bullish or were you trying to avg lower hoping for bounce to exit @ breakeven? After U figured out your bias lean (bull or bear) and w/$100K + position in a single instrument do the homework (TA). This will determine how aggressive & directionality of your approach towards the options trade. Mistakes are inevitable, doing the analysis of instrument, group, sector will reduce but not eliminate chances of losses. Trading is about risk mgt and living to trade another day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 16:53:42'] It is crazy that RH would even send out this warning.Think about this.   Your short 710 call is trading about .60.  The stock is 498.  The dividend is .16.  If someone exercised this call, they would immediately lose 212 (they would be buying the stock at 710 when it is trading 498.)  They would lose the premium in the call, .60  all to make  16 cents.   So for every 710 call they exercised, they would lose over $21,000If you were assigned, you would be selling the stock for 710 when its trading 498.  This would be a very good thing, but it won't happen.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 16:30:43'] Unless you wrote something wrong there is no way someone is going to exercise a 710 call when the stock is at 500 to get a dividend. Even if that did happen, that would give you a max profit scenario with your long calls there to provide you a way to cover the short or you could just buy the stock but it's not going to happen.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 17:19:45'] Your math doesn‚Äôt add up. You can only be down the difference in premium which is what you initially paid for them. You won‚Äôt get assigned and if you do they will just close out your contracts that you own. During dividends people tend to exercise instead of selling for the extra cash so this is an automated notice to all option holders more than likely.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 17:04:12'] how are you down 10G? the calls you bought are at 4.30, alittle higher than you paid and the ones you sold are a little lower. so youre ahead.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 06:32:56'] If your plan was to buy high and sell low, go for it - sell now - but since that was not likely your plan, do not sell when we are in the middle of a dip or correction or whatever you want to call this. Sell only if something fundamental has changed with the company or your investment thesis. Last note: buying options is risky, as they are both volatile and they are essentially a wasting asset (time decay). I presume you are playing with gambling money (money you can afford to lose). Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 04:11:53'] This close to expiration, your risk is very high, though if the current pre-market price holds, you'd be looking at perhaps a 60-70% probability of max profit (need to wait until the market opens to see how the position P/L changes). Your breakeven price is around $591, which is pretty decent. The odds are in your favor currently. What happens over the next 3 days is anyone's guess, so be prepared for a max loss on the position if the market takes any kind of downturn, even a 1-2% mini-correction in NDX. These types of trades are best kept small, and shouldn't be used for making any significant returns on your account overall. I've done hundreds of these kinds of short-term plays, and while the probability seems like it's on your side, the reality is that those probabilities don't take into account any *unpredictable* external events. This is why we love giving a trade time. Bull put spreads placed 30-45 days till expiration have a much larger safety net due to time being on your side in case a downward move occurs.In any case, if you do open the position, I wish you luck.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 04:36:04'] Looking at the current entry point - the price is pulling off all averages sharply.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 11:45:21'] The last "big" swing NVDA had on earnings since mid-2018 was 11/15/2018 when it opened -19.3% and closed -18.75% from the previous close. The last two earnings have been basically flat, and the two biggest upward movements on earnings over the last couple years have been on 8/15/2019 (+7.25%) and 2/13/2020 (7.02%) based on closing price the day after earnings. I'd have tempered expectations for a huge upward swing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:34:56'] That's pretty cool. I have actually been logging option quotes (mostly puts) in real-time for several years as part of my trading so I looked back to see if any violated arbitrage by at least a penny when paying full spread. Out of 4.3 million quotes, there were 52 that did. Pretty low hit rate! E.g. On June 17 2022, HCP220617P00030000 was 2.75x3.40 when underlying was 26.34. So that's a free 26 cents: buy the put and buy the stock. Unfortunately I didn't log order book sizes so I don't know how many contracts you could've bought at 3.40...probably not many.On July 23 2021, WKHS210723P00015500 was 4.60x4.65 when WKHS was 10.82. That's 3 cents (but uh I dunno about WKHS stock spread).So this post was interesting but if you're gonna watch for these manually, you're probably going to have a boring time! One note: all of them were very ITM (delta of 90+, usually 99) and same-day expiry so maybe watch those.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 20:08:00'] Your last bullet point (impossible to roll up anymore because too deep ITM) may happen at some point, and then you will realize your CC strategy made you missing the entire upside of your stock just to collect a premium that is only a small portion of it. This is the risk. And the downside.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 22:34:33'] The downside of CC‚Äôs is that you capped your gains quite a bit all while your downside protection is minimal.  It‚Äôs not unusual for a stock like NVDA to be up 100% a year from now following a miserable down year like we had last year. Then you‚Äôve missed out on significant gains.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 21:41:58'] If you are determined to retain ownership of the stock, then you will treat the covered call writing as equivalent to someone who is writing naked calls.  What will happen is you will always attempt to roll out and move to higher strike prices so that you don't have to buy back the written call at a loss.  The problem is that NVDA tends to make most of its gains in spurts just like when it went from 110 to 180 from Oct to Dec.  Then is went from 140 to the current price of 191 in one month.  You will experience lots of frustrations and fear of missing out on the potential gains.  I would personally just let it get assigned and let the stock get called away.  You will have $16,500.  I would then use $6,400 to buy 19 JAN 2024 150 call for $64.00 ($23 extrinsic value and $41intrinsic value).Then immediately sell a 17 MAR 23 195 call for $14 against it ($14 extrinsic value and $0 intrinsic as of this writing).  This will reduce your cost to $5,000.  This is an ITM diagonal spread  which should have approximately a net +40 delta (long and short combined).  This will pay for more than half of the extrinsic value on the JAN 2024 150 call that you purchased.  I would just keep rolling this every 30 days ($6-7 of premium for a 30 delta call) and eventually you will end up with a Jan 2024 Bull Call Spread when you get to the final month and you can exercise the Jan 2024 150 strikes should owning NVDA still be your goal.  By doing it this way you can adjust the strikes on the calls you write every 30 days, which can offer downside protection from the juicy premiums should NVDA trend lower, as opposed to being tied up to something for 12 months and you are stuck with the $29 premium from the LEAPS you wrote.  Edit: You will have $11,500 left over.  You can use $11,000 to invest in other opportunities.  Then you can send $500 to me via Paypal friends and family. Haha.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 20:34:07'] A common early misconception about rolling is that loss is escaped.  It isn‚Äôt, it comes out of whatever option that‚Äôs rolled to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 00:43:50'] It works as long as the stock goes up and frankly the approach is less than ideal.If you NVDA will keep going up, just buy calls and let your stock get called.You are basically lifting the ceiling on your stock for a very long period of time for little to no premium while exposing your entire position to the downside. The stock is very volatile so eventually you will be far enough out of the money on your short strike then NVDA falls - 20% and you get to keep your stock and didn't lock in any gain. Your trade has little upside and lots of downside. Not to mention you are paying your broker commissions.If you roll you need to before it becomes massively in the money. In my opinion, the best thing to do is let it get taken away then lay out next time with a more flexible approach.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:14:52'] Selling options 1 year out is silly for a variety of reasons.  The main 2 is you have a constant liability in your account and you can‚Äôt easily get out of it without paying money, and 2) you get virtually little to no theta for the first 9-10 months of your 1 year contract.  You unfortunately waited too long to roll.  I don‚Äôt advise rolling 1 year out.  Let NVDA get called from you and move on to another trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:54:59'] thats a risk you run with CCs, you take your money up front if the stock moons. but always follow rule #1. NEVER loose money. factor how how much it will cost to roll up the 165.( IE will you get back more than you spend in the costs of the calls if you roll it up) if you come out loosing money on the roll up, just let it expire and possibly execute then if you want the shares back go write a CSP on it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:09:19'] Do nothing with the position for now.In the future avoid single-issue risk when you sell covered calls.Use an ETF like SPY instead.   It's far less prone to melt-downs and melt-ups.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:35:19'] It's a pretty volatile stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:47:01'] If I misjudge a potential breakout on a stock and get caught itm I try to find the nearest date diagonal with break even premium, even if I‚Äôm still itm, and see if it reverses at all (it usually does). Or I roll itm calendar calls for a few weeks and smaller credit. But I don‚Äôt recommend chasing it very long or that far out. Just let it go.You have a few options after that: invest in something else, sell and roll puts on the same stock (or something else), or try a different strategy altogether. Someone else described buying a leap to cover short dated calls (poor man‚Äôs covered call). And if you can get the approval, you can learn straddles, collars, condors and butterflies which have a ‚Äúdefined risk‚Äù or a specific maximum gain/loss profile. But sooner or later ccs and csps are going to move too far too fast, esp chipmakers. They frequently correct, but sometimes they don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs pointless to tie up capital forever if it doesn‚Äôt come back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:09:58'] I count 5 waves down on the weekly from the '21 high to the '22 low  and an a-b-c counter trend rally from the '22 low until Friday past.   The implication is that NVDA has started another 5 waves down which will end substantially below the '22 low.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:31:17'] Curious why you're selling options so far out. 1 year is crazy imo. I always thought the best value for CCs is no more than 4 weeks out. Lately I've been selling weeklies on all my positions because they're easy to roll up if needed and it's not a huge commitment against my shares in the current unpredictable market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:25:44'] You could make it a covered call spread which solves the problem of it going to the moon
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:32:45'] I would wait until next week as there are a few important evens this week which could affect nvda. That said, this is how running the wheel works, you will not always be on the winning side. Sometimes the price drops below your cost basis or it runs through your CC. Its why you shouldn‚Äôt always have on a position. You do have to do some due diligence. Look out for announcements, earnings, or if something has been on a massive dip and has a tendency of moving big.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:01:38'] To me, once I am deep itm, I would continue to roll up and out, but my rule is to at least breakeven on closing the call and opening a new one. there is no one stock that can keep going up or down in a straight line. There is always a pull back. When it pull back, I close the call and sell a new one. The downside of cc is the cap gain, just a risk/reward aspect. The bright side is if the stock price stabilizes at some point, you could slowly catch up to that gain, maybe. :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:15:19'] The downsides of covered calls are simple.1) You‚Äôre selling upside for premium. You‚Äôre giving away profits over a certain level in exchange for collecting money. That‚Äôs the whole point. 2) You get a bit of downside protection but can still experience large drawdowns on downside moves. 3) If you keep rolling up and out, you may never take profits. You can see NVDA go from $200 to $400 to $200 in 4 years and if you just roll every time, you may collect a bit of premium and still hold the shares at a 0% gain in 4 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:53:40'] Or suffer a loss, buy to close at $31
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:30:58'] The major downside is it doesn't work.There comes a point where things rise to the point where the strike cannot be adjusted (when the short call or put is too far ITM). We also run out of runway. For example, with NVDA: if you just rolled deep ITM calls to the furthest weeklies (and no more are offered) then there's a large price move against you, then what? Okay, we roll to the next monthly (taking a haircut from liquidity). It happens again, the next monthly is now 2 months away. As you go further out in time, they have fewer expiry offerings to maintain liquidity. Additionally, each time you roll as it moves against you, you're realizing a loss and eroding the value of your account. I roll frequently, but it's not a magic fix.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:37:43'] You may wanna learn about opportunity cost and rethink this...
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 11:20:25'] There is a large opportunity cost to selling options so far out from expiry.I've rolled up and out a number of times but usually not any more than one or two months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 11:57:40'] You're missing the upside if NVDA keep going up and up. Also, it's not like you are collecting  theta on leap. I'm in the same situation on NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:57:54'] Sell a put credit spread. Here's one for $500 not $400:Jan 29, 2021 500/495 put credit spread is 42 DTE, 30 delta. If NVDA closes above 500 on Jan 29th you keep the $159 credit, and you risk up to $500 (less credit) max loss if it closes below $495. In reality you should sell the spread when you either hit 70% profit or a couple weeks to expiry. This is a 30% max return on your risked capital.Sell 1/29 500p to open, Buy 1/29 495p to open
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 05:14:25'] You can get a Jan 530/535 Vertical Call Spread for about $2.30 - the Open Interest on this is over 7200 which makes this position easy to enter and easy to exit - NVDA will open Monday in $531 range - if it consolidates as you have surmised, you sit tight - if it breaks out to the upside, exit position, take profit, and move to the Jan 535/540 Vertical which also has a relatively high Open Interest making for easy entry/exit - the caveat to this play is NVDA tends  to be volatile - a quick glance at even a 5 day chart shows us a $524 - $538 spread - no matter, for your dollar amount, this play may work - Best of Luck -
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 16:04:49'] Great. thanks for the inputs guys. quite a few ideas for me to work with. I like the long bull spread quite a lot since I'd like to capture the upside. maybe even finance the upside with a put credit spread on the downside.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 16:08:53'] Eh only thing you can do in that scenario is buy a deeper OTM call maybe for an EOM one and hope for a big move. NVDA options are pricey and that $400 spend would limit you to very few options haha

POST_TEXT: b'I am currently long on a deep ITM NVDA 10/16 $480/$500c debit spread. I got a notification from Robinhood that they recommend I close all my short positions in NVDA since its highly likely the contracts get exercised due to their dividend date coming up. It further said I would be responsible for paying the dividend to the exerciser of the $500c contract.\n\nMy assumption is the $480c contract would cover me in this scenario and it would actually be the favorable scenario for me that the $500c gets exercised. This way I would realize the maximum gain of $2000 ($500-$480) instead of having to wait until contract expiration (10/16)\n\nIs this correct or is there something I am missing where it would be better for me to close the position?'
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 09:37:12'] Your thinking is correct. If somebody wants to exercise the 500 calls, you would pay out the dividend, but you can either exercise your call (to cover your short) or you can sell your 480 call and buy NVDA stock in the open market (to cover your short).BTW, it is UNLIKELY that the October 500 call is going to be exercised even though it is deep in the money. The calls are about $59 bid to $61 offer. The underlying is about $538 per share. The dividend is only 16 cents per share. Not optimal to exercise the deep in the money call for the dividend.Robinhood probably has a standard blast email that they send to everybody. However, it is to their BENEFIT for you to unwind the position before it goes ex-dividend so they can get payment for order flow. Thus, it is obviously not to your benefit to unwind the spread before NVDA goes ex-dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 09:17:39'] Can someone explain why the options holder should pay the dividends?

POST_TEXT: b"I sincerely think that NVDA will be worth $370+ in the near future. I understand that NVDA's earning call will take place tomorrow AH. I am holding $355c 6/5. People keep telling me earnings may screw me over. I am not very familiar with earnings & IV, I just understand in simple terms, stock goes up, price of contract may go up as well.. What are the downsides of holding my calls through earnings?"
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 16:41:49'] As earnings approach, the IV of the options slowly increase. This inflates the extrinsic value of the option, sometimes by quite a bit. This effect usually peaks just before the close of the last day before earnings are reported. In fact, some people buy options a few weeks before earnings just to 'ride the swell' and sell out right before earnings. When the market opens the day after earnings, the IV will be absolutely crushed, which will dramatically reduce the extrinsic value of that option.This means that the stock will have to make a significant move upward just to counteract the IV crush. It is not unusual for the stock to move in the correct direction, but the option still loses value. If, for some reason, the market is not satisfied with the earnings report, the stock price may fall and you'll get doubly screwed.That's why holding options through earnings is always a gamble, even when the company is solid.If it was me, I would sell out about 3pm tomorrow, hopefully at a profit. Then if you are still bullish after earnings, buy back in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 16:08:04'] Well you are itm and have some time on it so you may be okay. You get iv crushed really bad on the weekly options that are day of or expire that week. It carries over into the other chains but not as bad. The downsides is simply that if it moves less than the expected move and you are not itm after or within a few strikes you‚Äôre screwed unless you have a good amount of time on them

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 17:22:14'] just give you an idea, this is what I experienced with target ER today. I bought 123P 6/19 exp for 4.85 when the stock was at 124 yesterday evening.Today, after the ER the stock dropped to $121 and the option price was around $4.85. This is because of drop in IV. IV dropped by 9% from yesterday, and the option price dropped correspondingly. However, delta > Vega, so if the stock moves sufficiently high, the drop in Volatility will be compensated by increase in delta. BTW, how much did you pay?
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 16:01:52'] I‚Äôm sorry. If you don‚Äôt understand how ER affects IV then why are you holding calls through earning?
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 16:48:23'] Completely honest here not trolling anything - looking for an honest opinion. Do you mean NVDA stock price will be at $370 in the near future or do you actually mean you think it will be *valued* at $370 in the near future. In other words, my gut says you mean it's gonna be at $370 soon but I want to see because perhaps you think that's it's true value.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-20 17:50:29'] If you want to hedge against volatility a little bit, you could sell an option farther OTM (at the same expiration or sooner) turning it into a debit spread or debit diagonal

Sell it about 15 percent above current price.For ex. Your avg: 140, Call strike: 162.5, expiry: 27 Jan, 2023, income from selling the call: 126$Since this is a long term investment for you, a return of 15% over such a small period should be acceptable for you.Definitely a lot of other factors could be considered such as not selling when the stock is down a lot and there is possibility of rocketing upwards, Powell meetings, earnings, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 17:05:45'] If you like the stock and want to generate income, sell far OTM puts.  Worst case scenario, you buy it at a good price and get paid to do so until that price point arrives.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 17:50:06'] That all depends on Why you plan on holding the stock long term.  In the short call business, I find it best to treat the underlying as a tool that makes me profit.  The more profit I wish to make, as dictated by the strike chosen and corresponding premium paid, the greater the risk of -assignment.  So to better ensure you will keep the stock, you must be disciplined in choosing your strikes.I always recommend cutting one‚Äôs option teeth with lesser priced underlying stock.  Newer participants writing $17,000 ccalls are simply looking for trouble.  $1700 is a much more realistic allocation when new.

If you have 140 AAPL‚Äôs, why not write 150c as well as a 125p?  1) If shares are called, you get capital appreciation + 2 premiums;2) if put finishes ITM, you average down with 2 premiums; roll the put or take assignment and begin writing 2 covered calls next period.  Management discretion!3) if the price is stagnant/ flat, all is good; repeat.Of course you need to prepare for a possible put assignment, so either be ready with the cash, or manage the put strike according to your preferences.

Well if the stock is only worth 40 you need to buy the 50 out with a stock worth 50-2, 48.00 . You  are minus 8.00 x100 = 800. You can‚Äôt sell it and it might keep going down . All the sudden your CC is a cash covered put - you are taking it back at a cheaper price . You could just do nothing , the stock might go up or , it might tank more .

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 22:47:57'] It‚Äôs a good idea but also check the delta value, so that it‚Äôs 0.3 or less. That will reduce the probability of your shares getting called away. But keep in mind that your shares may also get called away *before* the exp date, if the call buyer wants to exercise an ITM option early, perhaps to own the shares ahead of an upcoming ex-dividend date. If your shares do get called away, you can use the cash to sell a cash-secured put, either for the same stock if it makes sense or for a different stock that you wish to own.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 00:31:51'] Downsides. Your options get called away from you. And you have to sell it for less than ideal price and lose money on potential growth and some time you don‚Äôt want to sell at all just hold it forever but then again it gets called away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 09:05:45'] I used to sell CCs on AAPL but it‚Äôs IV is very low so if there is a big move in the money which happens from time to time it would take an exorbitant amount of time to roll back out of the money and be minimally lucrative in premium. Further, CSPs so far OTM are hardly worth your time in premium as well. Regarding NVIDIA, I‚Äôve been selling calls on them for about 15 months with a few personal rules: only sell in Green Day‚Äôs after they have had a 3.5%+ move, sell very short dated - no more than 2 weeks, aim for $100-150 premium return per CC whatever strike that may be, and never sell calls dated around earnings reports. Hasn‚Äôt bit me in the ass yet and the return is about 12% annual on original investment the past year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 18:48:38'] the market zig zags a lot but as someone who has sold covered calls in the past i can tell you, you better have some good discipline . nothing worse than a stock going up 10% in 3 days and it being considered a stalwart and then getting assigned and losing all that potential gains, what would u do buy back? sell puts and collect literal pennies or sell puts closer to the new price and risk losing from the gap it reached? ex: aapl 140sell 150 aapl callsaapl hits 170 sell 160 aapl puts go way down the line and sell 150 aapl puts to make a decent return? aapl hits 180,190 never touches 150 again, what do you do then? i only say this because u say u never want to keep the stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 20:05:42'] What happens when the stock price drops 10 percent.  Now you can‚Äôt sell calls at the price u paid.  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with it.  If you sell below your cost basis and the stock rallies.  You take a loss on shares.

You understand that over a long enough period of time, like 15+ years, writing CCs *reduces* your average annual return, right? You can't lower your risk of loss on the downside without also giving up something on the upside.The function of a CC is to sacrifice future gains for cash today. If the cash is worth more to you than the future gains, by all means, write CCs. But that is not consistent with a plan to hold shares long term, presumably for future gains.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 11:25:37'] I‚Äôve been selling CC‚Äôs for a long time, usually 4 ish weeks out expiration, slightly OTM. Generally speaking, they expire worthless and I keep the premium, thanking the tards for buying. However, the tard will win occasionally and I will get burned and leave money on the table. If you track your stock price, sell on days when it rockets up for no apparent news and the IV increases. If you make 1200 in premium on 6 contracts in a year, it is a lot less risky than making 1200 on 12 contracts in a year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 12:51:16'] What I do is sell covered spreads. You get a smaller credit up front, so better than doing nothing. Then if the stock rises you can sell the long for a profit. And then hopefully the short eventually becomes worthless. If not,hopefully it comes back less that the credits you have received. Depending on the expectations, I may do covered ratio spreads, diagonals, etc. They call them options, because they give you options
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 14:31:18'] Sell covered calls on stocks you want to sell.Sell puts on stocks you want to buy.If you want to keep a stock, let it be.  If your bull thesis on the stock turns true, you would make tons more money keeping the stock than whatever you get in premiums
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-10 15:35:58'] If you own at least 100 shares of NVDA, and you sold a 195 covered call for $63, another alternative to earn $50-100 per month is selling out of the money call credit spreads on NVDA.  For example sell 1 Dec 23 195 Call for .79 and buy 1 for Dec 23 205 Call for .28 for a credit of $51. The short 195 call has a delta of 10 so a 10% chance of being in the money. Your risk is $949 which sounds high but it is off set by your stock in your portfolio so you‚Äôll just be flat from 195-205 (gain from the stock pays for the credit spread loss) should NVDA go to 195 or higher in the next two weeks. At above 205 your profit will start to rise again should NVDA close above 205 in two weeks. With this strategy you don‚Äôt have to worry about any assignment for whatever your reason is for not wanting to sell the stock. If NVDA closes below 195 by 12/23, you don‚Äôt have to do anything and you keep the premium.  If NVDA closes at 220, for example, your underlying would have gained $5k but your credit spread would have lost $949 but your are still positive $4k.  At least you don‚Äôt have the possibility of being assigned and having to sell NVDA and pay taxes or whatever your reason is for not wanting to liquidate.  Just repeat selling the 10 deltas every two weeks and you can gain $100 a month.  Just my two cents.  I‚Äôm sure there are other options traders with better ideas.Edit: Actually with a covered call you are capped out at whatever call strike you sold.  For example, if NVDA closes at 250 but you sold the 195 strike you make  $2,500 max plus credit (170-195) but the call buyer makes the difference from 195-250 minus the premium.  With this strategy, you continue to make money above 205 since you will be long 205 calls.  This strategy is better for unanticipated huge moves.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-11 11:08:05'] If you want to accumulate these names long term selling OTM puts might a better option. You can buy on dips or roll down and usually make money without getting assigned and if you do, big deal.

Never base your trades on them, base your trades on whether your investment was sound and if you have conviction it will go higher. 3 weeks on a high beta play is a lifetime.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 19:33:33'] Holy crap. Stop trying to show off, and go learn how to calculate gains...Your 1700% gain calculation makes absolutely no sense. **You got about a 15% return.** (which is pretty lame, btw, for the risk you took on an earnings play in which you were perfectly right on direction...)Your calculation is just wrong. - First reason - it makes no sense to divide the profit by the initial debit or credit, which is what you did to get to 1700% return. Think about it - it's perfectly possible to open trades with $0 change in cash. Eg, sell an option for $1, buy another different option for $1. Net, your debit, or credit, is $0. If you made $0.01 on that trade, would you claim that you made +Inf%? That's one reason why your calculation is nonsense.- Second reason - in your calculation, you assumed that you earned around $800 by "investing" around $40. But in reality, if you deposit $40 with a broker and try to open such a position, the broker will laugh at you and tell you to come up with more cash. You can only open such a position with *more* than $5k in your account. That means that you got $800 return on an investment of $5k. That's around 15% (with commissions and fees).Also, keep in mind that you risked at least $5k to make a tiny bit of money. In reality, you actually risked considerably more than $5k, because the contracts have different expirations.This is a play that is worth a lot of praise over at /r/wallstreetbets .
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 19:45:37'] Yeah that ain‚Äôt a 1700% gain. If that were true all short options would have infinite gain.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-11 15:57:43'] I learned a few lessons I already knew on this earnings. First, I made a play going into earnings.  Risky. Second, I bought a call going into earnings, understanding IV crush and overvaluation in anticipation of beating projected earnings. And third, I was up 200% before the bell on a big OTM June expiration that I help for just over a day, and I gambled it. Earnings came out and crushed projections. Stock dumped. Now I‚Äôm barely back to even. It was only $99 gamble so I‚Äôll let it play out, but greed got the best of me.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-27 13:24:40'] I don't know how far dated they are, but if you are just asking me which one is more likely to stay OTM for your short puts, clearly the TSLA 12/18 350 put is more likely to be OTM by then.  However, the NVDA 450s probably are worth a little bit more in value.  Again, I just assumed 12/18 expiration.  On expectation (this is important, since this is different than probability of being OTM), the TSLA 12/18 350s are slightly better imo.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-27 17:02:30'] Nvda 450. Tsla has run up too much for the 350 p to deliver much premium, plus IV will expand up until s&p inclusion.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-19 05:15:17'] Are you buying the strangles and straddles
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-19 08:58:30'] I assume when you say 'doing' a straddle/strangle, you mean buying a straddle/strangle. I'm gonna comment on buying a straddle, buying a strangle is similar but with wider breakevens.When you buy an ATM straddle, you want the stock to move more than the price of the straddle by expiration. Currently the price of the ATM straddle is $31.60, if you believe NVDA should move more than $31.60 in either direction, then buying the straddle would make sense.If you want to close the trade Thursday morning, then you want NVDA to move more than the expected move from their earnings. The expected move is around $30. If you believe NVDA can move more than $30 after earnings, buying a straddle would make sense.TL;DR: buying a straddle for earnings is a coin flip. You lose if the stock stays inside expected move, you make money if it moves outside the expected move.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-19 09:18:29'] I‚Äôm thinking condor to protect from IV crush. $460/462.5 puts and 530/535 calls. 461.23-531.27 would be the range it‚Äôs gotta stay in for max profit.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-10 09:43:41'] I'm already up 60% on my 230 237.5 bull put spread, but I've been on the fence about staying in or out of this earnings.  On order entry I was committed to staying in, but the run up has sort of gone beyond reasonable expectations.  Trade still has positive expected value and would have to drop to $234 for me to breakeven (10% chance according to TW).  I think NVDA has great value and potential for a quick recovery in a worst case scenario and IV crush will help to some degree if a down move is larger than anticipated (didn't give myself much time for it though).  Will likely decide by end of day when the expected value of the remaining profit turns into a 50/50 shot.  If negative, I'm taking my profits and getting out.

Does that mean inside the middle max profit area of the IC? And then the way the play ended, you canceled your 25% buy back because you saw you had a chance to let both sides expire worthless and maximize profit, but then in Edit 2, NVDA started to move and you bought back one side for a $20 debit, is that right?Thanks for your help in advance

Covered calls are easy.  For myself, I just plan to have the underlying called away if they expire in the money.  Selling a covered call has an identical risk profile to selling a naked put, but with different margin requirements.   Below the strike, you own the stock.

You sold a 250 call and the stock is currently $255.78. I'd sit tight, if the stock drops you still got the premium and can sell another call on it after the dust settles (IV will be down after earnings, but it's still a high IV stock so you'll be fine there). If it gets called away from you that just means you made a lot of money. Not a bad problem to have!

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 07:09:17'] You don't say what the expiration date of your spread is, but even if it is June 11th, you are not at risk of early assignment due to the dividend.  The dividend is only .16.  To determine your risk of assignment you would look at the 680 puts and they are trading substantially over the dividend amount.  There is still a substantial amount of extrinsic value in the 680 calls that one would lose if they exercised them.

I understand that High OTM calls will be practically worthless after IV crush.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-13 23:30:42'] Vega has its strongest effect ATM, so deeper ITM options suffer vega crushes but they are not as significant: think of a bell curve centered around ATM options. Your calls will suffer a IV crush but the price movement will offset it and you'll be most likely positive ceteris paribus.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-14 04:26:43'] As long as your call is ATM, the intrinsic value is there and IV crush cannot depreciate the intrinsic value which in your case is $18 per contact, so expect 18+ of profit when market opens. Congrats

If you paid less than $18 for your ATM calls, you are about to collect some profit (and if NVDA keeps up with $288)
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-14 07:03:50'] Great job!!! Happy for you! Consider getting a couple PUT positions if and when $NVDA sells off. Keep a lookout end of day for a mini sell off. And Puts are good price too.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-13 23:22:50'] You will be gaining money in this case. The goal is to be ITM when it comes to buying options, but depends your entry point as well. You can sell the contract for profit tomorrow even before 3/20 expiration. IV crush will not do much damage for your option as much as it will for the weekly options.

Once you know something (data) it will be too late to make your option play.   Personally would short SPY vs those two stocks.  That play is dead imo.  Once we crack 400 will be going short.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 20:32:00'] The market is so forward looking it‚Äôs dizzying.  A soft landing might actually be worse for stocks than a recession, because then the Fed likely will stick to it‚Äôs promise not to lower rates.  Fundamental valuation of stocks uses the discounted cashflow model, so higher rates for longer is a killer for fundamental stock valuation just as it is for long term bonds.Based on federal funds futures and the inverted yield curve, the market is damn-near positive we‚Äôre going to have a recession, so this is already mostly priced in.  Some speculate the market will only fall more if economic indicators continue to stay white hot.  More than a soft landing, we appear to be in a period of explosive growth, and this doesn‚Äôt make the case for lower interest rates.

You are either doubling your position size or allowing more time to an already failing position. The one thing you never want to do is roll your winning side closer in. A lot of traders like to take the side that isn't feeling any pressure and moving them closer to at-the-money. This allows them to take their profits and sell another spread thus collecting more credit. The problem with this is that the underlying could turn around and put pressure on that side. If you have a winning side leave it be. Don't turn a winner into a loser."Source: https://theoptionprophet.com/blog/6-ways-to-adjust-an-iron-condor

POST_TEXT: b'Here is a trade we are going to put on early on in the week if it looks like the support trend line on NVDA will hold.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-25 22:00:27'] Synthetic longs are very cost efficient but gamma might kill you.I mean you are basically just doubling down on calls except you are neutralizing theta/vega by selling a put instead. Trendlines are one of those things that works until it doesn't.Good luck and manage the risk appropriately, if trend breaks down it'll kill you unless you do some rolling magic. If it goes up it'll be winner winner chicken dinner. I prefer just selling the puts, remember that the put premium is essentially a deductible and by buying the call you are paying your deductible.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-16 06:53:02'] I dont think you should have any issues with wash sales.  Those only apply to options if you buy and sell the same strike and expiration date.  I dont think that is your plan and should be easy to avoid.In three years of trading options I have still not done pmcc in my live account.  I have done it in the paper account a few times.  The trades always turned out profitable but I just never felt I understood the best way to manage it.  I still like the concept.I am interested to know how you picked your long call delta and expiration?  The extrinsic value of the goog call represents 30% of the current value.  That seems high to me but it does allow you to risk less capital.

NVDA closed at $232 and my spread is at $43 loss. Vega is only 2, so implied volatility should not have much effect.\n\nWhat exactly happened here?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 15:47:34'] Both the 220 and 230 are ITM. The 230 strike which ur long probably lost greater value than your short 220 which is deep ITM. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt sell a credit spread this deep ITM, just not optimal. You‚Äôll have to wait for NVDA to drop more to see any real return. Also would recommend putting ur trade in OptionStrat, you‚Äôll see what I mean.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:44:31'] Options pricing is based on the stock move, but also on IV and theta decay.The stock moved mostly sideways the last few days in through today, but has dropped off to around $228 in AH trading.  The IV has dropped to a rank of 10% and with 31 days to go the theta decay should be ramping up.  This means the position should start moving in the right direction tomorrow morning.   You don't say what credit you recieved, but thi could also be based on the bid-ask spread being a bit wide on this weekly chain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 16:28:50'] ITM credit spreads have the identical Greeks and P/L profile as OTM debit spreads at the same strikes. So while this position is ITM, you will see the same behavior as if you had purchased an OTM 220/230 PDS. You will not see theta decay until the short leg goes OTM.As the other poster said, look at it in optionstrat or on your platform if you don't believe that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 04:13:17'] Credit put spread, it‚Äôs broken. It never fails. It works. Just lay it out of the money strike. For ex, short spy350 put. It‚Äôs just facts.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-13 08:47:07'] Maybe you said "Short Put" when actually meant "Long Put"? otherwise you will have 2 bullish positions.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-13 09:53:15'] What was your purchase price on that call and what is the value currently? You may be able to sell a OTM call against it as a small hedge. Buying a put will also give you a downside hedge but you‚Äôll take a small ding as it will eat some of the gain on your long call if NVDA pops up. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-14 03:07:04'] You can try the Poor Man's Covered Call.  I think someone mentioned it already.  Your long call acts as the synthetic stock position.  Then you sell short calls near the money to collect premiums.  Could help while you wait for the long call to work out.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-15 20:41:13'] Update: for those curious I pulled the trigger on this play Tuesday with an 11/23 $207.5 put. I then chickened out today and sold the put, keeping my long call. Big mistake. I‚Äôve lost a lot of money second guessing. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-13 08:16:38'] I don't know about idiotic but you are basically doubling your risk.  If the stock goes back up the short put would effectively reduce the price of the call.  if the price is flat you'd take max loss on the call and max gain on the put.  If the price drops you'd be losing on the call and the put.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-07 13:22:51'] With only 10 DTE, and given that it didn't start as an earnings play - I'd close it.  However, if you rolled up your 205/200 to the 235/230, you could take in another ~100 credit and be centered today, but being a few days early...you risk being off-center for earnings.I would consider closing (only if I'm keeping a net credit) and re-centering for the earnings - maybe set up wings at 2x expected move if there's enough premium at that altitude (or 1.5x if not).
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-07 12:11:45'] Are you up or down on it? Just curious because I haven't had much luck opening IC's early when the expiration is after earnings. The expanding IV almost always puts me in the red prior to earnings, and I would have been better off opening right before earnings.

I believe the implied move as of today is +/- 14.25, (based on MMM of Thinkorswim) but I'm sure that could change by the day of the ER. I've seen $20 swings on gap up/gap downs on its ERs frequently. It's odd though, IV on NVDA is pretty low right now considering the ER is coming up. Last ER it was sitting around 60% 3 days prior, and right now it's only at 43%.

	COMMENT: ['2017-06-03 03:54:56'] If you're a beginner, don't trade LEAPs. Stick to 1 to 3 month expirations to start. There are way too many reasons to not trade far out expiries but liquidity is the main issue. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-03 04:42:13'] I think if you understand the risks of holding a LEAP compared to just owning the underlying, then buying a LEAP can be a good way to get some leverage.One thing I do is to figure out the break even point between going long on the underlying verses buying the LEAP. Here it's about 185. Then I compare that to my target price and see if the risk of losing the entire value of the LEAP is worth the leverage that I gain with the LEAP. If your target price is 200 for Jan 2019? That'd be less than 2x leverage and personally that wouldn't be enough for me to risk losing 100% if the stock either stays flat, goes down, or only goes up modestly, and I'd just buy $2500 worth of NVDA. If you think it's realistically going to go to 300 or 400? Then that would be a good reason to do a LEAP.Also plan ahead what to do if the trade goes against you since the leverage works both ways. If the stock drops next earnings and the LEAP loses 50% of its value, what are you going to do?One thing to watch out for is the bid/ask spread. Here the ask is 24.25, but the bid is 25.70, so if you out in an order to buy at 24.25 it's probably not going to get filled. You can inch a limit order through the spread in increments of .05 or .1 and try to get filled at less than 25.70, but there's no guarantee. This will also work the other way when you're looking to sell, so it's going to cost you an additional $50 or $100 on both ends of the transaction.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-03 08:48:40'] My suggestion is no more than 5% of the account in any one position. So unless your account size is $50,000 or more, I vote thumbs down on the idea. Biggest mistakes newbies make are trading too big for their account size, and trading illiquid options. Your proposed trade looks like it touches on both mistakes. The bid/ask spread with the market closed is showing $2420 bid $2570 ask. That's $150 (or $75 if you fill at the mid) you'll never get back, and also a similar bid/ask when you try to exit. So your paying approximately $150 in friction. If you do market orders maybe more like $300 on a $2400 investment (more of a gamble really).Third thing, always have a plan before you get in. What is your plan if NVDA goes up, down or unchanged? If you only think about your upside, trading is easy, but unrealistic.

Don't cash it in unless there's super bad news. My AMZN leaps went from $31 to $27 to $32 in a day. I almost cashed in scared @ $27My TANG leaps are up on avg 75% this month.

RH users are extremely lucky that Monday gapped up, if it gapped down we'd be seeing a lottttt more posts about this.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 20:08:05'] According to a similar post that you placed on wallstreetbets, these were puts.But that isn't what you did if you ended up owning stock with a massive account swing. Nothing happens when you buy a put and it expires OTM worthless. Certainly you don't end up owning 500 shares as "the result of the put expiring."

Looking like this one is better just to own and not write calls for, or maybe deeper OTM calls.(R1) Be careful not to be "results oriented".

Don't fret on money you could have made because it will just add unneeded frustration.> (2) Thinking about waiting for 6/2, assuming I don't get assigned by then.(R2) Looks like there is plenty of extrinsic left in your call so you probably won't be assigned early.> (3) Maybe a rollout and step up(R3) You can roll out and up, assuming you have a decent commission rate. As long as you roll for a credit then you can't make a bad play. > (4) hope for a slight dip, repeat until I get back on track(R4) An issue I've come across with trying to help people with covered calls is getting them to understand that the underlying running through their short strike isn't a bad thing, as long as you always roll for a credit; the problem occurs when you buy back the ITM call and sell the OTM call for a debit.> (5) Should I just be happy with my gains and repeat the madness, this time with a deeper OTM call?(R5) Yes you should be happy. With something like $NVDA there is extrinsic even in the deep ITM calls you have a few options (i) close out the position for a profit (ii) roll the position to the same strike and just keep burning off extrinsic while reducing your basis (iii) roll up and out for a credit. Your choice should be based on your commission rate and whether or not you think you could be using the capital more effectively. Congrats on the winner and good luck with your trading
	COMMENT: ['2017-05-30 09:35:38'] This is a high class problem.Guys, what do I do?  I've reached maximum possible profit.
	COMMENT: ['2017-05-31 04:16:53'] I'll agree with put-call-put strategy. I made about 80% of the gains of NVDA last year doing covered writes. I eventually just exited the position. I was very happy with the results I had because I don't think I could have stomached the results in a purely unhedged long stock. At each point, I continued to learn how to manage a CC on a "rocket stock" which was new to me and I was more concerned with the downside than the upside at the time.I digress. Remember that you're selling volatility and that cuts both ways, sad when upside volatility pays better than you priced it and even more sad when downside volatility pays better than you priced it.A covered call strategy often doesn't beat just holding long stock over the long term. It does often achieve a better reward/risk ratio. Investing/trading/money management returns are more about risk management than absolute returns, in my mind.I really value consistent, repeatable, profitable performance over big wins. I never feel jealous over some guy that bought calls on a stock and made a 400% return. I know that if he isn't keeping his position sizes down that he's probably a one-trick pony that's out of the game very soon. Every smart trader knows that if you have a one-percent chance of going bust, it's not a question of if you'll go bust but only a question of when.
	COMMENT: ['2017-05-30 08:02:01'] Also thinking.... assuming this goose is cooked.  I can jump in another buy-write, grab a higher strike, still make good commission for 6/9 weekly.  Let the higher priced shared get called away on 6/2 for tax purposes....    Might be better to just take gains and walk?  
	COMMENT: ['2017-05-30 08:59:38'] If you let this "shoulda coulda woulda" mentality remain, it will fester your trading results. Let it go. Take the gain you have and be happy with it. Last year, I lost out on some significant gains during the precious metals double because of some covered calls, and it hurt,  but I moved on
	COMMENT: ['2017-05-30 09:55:24'] Personally I'd just let it ran and let it get called away. Then sell a cash secured put ATM or ITM to get back into the position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 23:34:55'] Yes, this is basically first step of The Wheel strategy. This is a strategy I have recently been doing a lot because you can collect good premiums on high volatility and red days. Just make sure you are picking good stocks that you would be happy to own at a price you would be happy to own.If you do end up owning these stocks you can then sell covered calls to again collect premiums and hopefully sell the stock for a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 16:18:49'] One thing to remember is that by selling options you give up flexibility. If something fundamental changes and the stock tanks, you‚Äôre still buying shares at your strike.If the stock falls to your strike tomorrow, you‚Äôre sitting on a big unrealized loss on your options compared to the guys who are buying stock at that low price.If the stock rebounds you‚Äôll only break even rather than profiting by buying the dip.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 22:43:27'] This is perfectly fine. I have similar set up on spy. Looking forward to picking a load of spy up below 360. As long you are cash covered and are fine with acquiring stocks at strike, which sounds like you are. Some people don't understand ccp is a valid strat to buy low while collecting premium on vol/theta. The worst outcome as is, is not amzn keeps tanking after exercise, but it bouncing back right before the option goes itm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 05:19:49'] Sort of. I did sell cash secured puts this week while the premiums were very high. I‚Äôve bee burned by this in the past. The secret is to be sure you want to own it at that strike. You may not. The danger is selling options is the instant gratification. You make money right now. It is tempting to take a small amount today, vs a large amount latter. Rolling a losing put is often a bad deal. You get a credit now, but lose even more. Instead of rolling I usually take buy to close if the chart is bad, or take assignment if good. Once assigned it‚Äôs easy to set a stop loss, or limit sell. Based on the chart I set a ‚Äúdrop dead‚Äù price. Below that price, I close the position no matter the cost.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-05 08:19:36'] That's a lot of rambling text. If the gist of the question is about current strangle price, NVDA has had some huge earnings moves in the past. Strangle sellers may be reluctant after big losses in the past.Again for the many beginners reading, straddle buyers are predicted to win about 1/3 of the time. This is basic theory based on market expectations. Market participants are guessing at the expected move, and may be wrong. However, over a large number of occurrences, results tend to be close to theory.Edit.. KISS may be worth exploring. I could not make head or tail of your current position. Keep it simple.Noob mistake #4 is adding complexity. If a person can't make money with simple trades, complexity only tends to add costs.Number 1 mistake is trading too big.  2 is trading illiquid products. 3 failure to plan before getting in. 4 adding complexity.

	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 17:59:56'] If you're giving up on the trade, you should get out now.  The pre-earnings IV is helping you, albeit a little.  After earnings when the IV drops, you'll be much closer to max loss if the price stays the same.If you think the price will drop on earnings, I'd wait to roll/close after.  You might not need to roll at all if you're right.  If you're wrong, the current max loss is still the worst it can go to.
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 18:02:28'] The credit is too low. Strive for about $1.70 on a $5 spread to have a good risk/reward ratio.IMO, it's too late to do much. Too close to expiration, should've taken action a week or two before. You could try rolling, but it's weeklies, less liquid. And earnings. And NVDA has already more than doubled since last summer. And they are disrupting the market again, new platform announced today. You see my point? Looks very bullish. But if you ever read my comments here, you know I don't know, so take these just as random brain farts :)If you roll, nothing will change when NVDA continues to rally, for example. Your assumption has changed. I doubt you would get any credit for a roll. However, you could try to salvage some losses by selling a put spread *in the same expiration*. Whatever premium you receive will not cost you additional buying power, at least.If put spread premium is garbage, take a loss (if not at a max yet) and close. Or leave it on otherwise and hope for a total earnings surprise. Miracles happen in the market :)
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-09 15:54:37'] So what did you do? 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 18:03:22'] Well if you're already at max loss I guess you may as well hold it in case earnings are bad and the stock tanks. After earnings, if you can roll out and up for a credit, that may be a good option. I wouldn't roll for a debit though. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 18:03:57'] I'm curious, how long ago did you sell the spread? And did you know it would expire just after their earnings report?
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 21:30:30'] I would just wait it out until earnings. You are already at max loss. A 10% move in either direction would not be surprising after earnings. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-06 22:41:35'] Watch it all day on the trading day after earnings.  It may spike up and then profit takers swoop in and may cause an actual decline.  Also, risking 4 to make 1 is not a good trade.  Risk 2 to make 1 is the rule of thumb.  Also, I see the spread is worth ~$300 right now.  So you are down about $208, with a max loss of $500.  Your risk is $200 and reward is $300.  So the risk-reward is better now, I suppose.

	COMMENT: ['2017-06-09 04:43:42'] Hi, I'm that newbie that was looking to buy NVDA calls for the first time a couple days ago.  Don't bet against NVDA in any way this stock is unstoppable for the next couple years.  I really hope that's true anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-08 07:21:54'] Jan 18 is too far out in my opinion.  It's better to roll 15-45 days out at a time.   It's because of how option premium decays, much faster in the short term. One of the risks of selling calls is what you're seeing now.  You've capped your upside.  If you think NVDA will continue higher, you might want to take the loss so you don't miss more.  If you think it'll come back in, you can keep selling the current strike till it does.
	COMMENT: ['2017-06-08 07:24:35'] Let your shares get assigned, you'll sell them for a profit and then you can always rebuy them if you want to hold.  What price did you sell your call for? If you can roll for a credit then you can do it.

Concerned more about a sell-off than NVIDIA's results at this point, hence the cushion.I'm all for going against the grain, but I'm finding those are extremely difficult to determine and would at most sell some call spreads if you're still confident about it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 08:40:04'] First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?Those aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.-------------------For the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.The best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.You don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.Now, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.For now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.You can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolioAsset allocation calculators:https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocationhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulationhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculatorhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:27:36'] I personally hedge with SQQQ.  Paying 20% in capital gains is certainly better than losing 25% of your portfolio value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:29:56'] If OP has been investing for 10 years it has been in a declining interest rate environment so the strategy has been great.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:57:39'] Hedging is twice the brain damage of market timing.  If you're hedging a potential bear, and get one, when will you take the hedge off ?   If you're hedging a bear and get a bull, how much hedge pain will you tolerate ?   If you are using options then time is money!  The more deltas you want the more the time will cost you.   Hedging each winning name would be wow: That's a lot of hedging!  Can you beta-weight to SPY or QQQ ?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 13:11:59'] Depends do you want to hedge position completely 100 shares to 100 shares, theoretically locking in a profit from your cost basis to your strike?Or do you want to hedge a portion of it, like selling a covered call.If you are saying you don‚Äôt want to pay capital gains on the future hedging for this year, look for expirations past 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 18:01:43'] You can sell a box hedge around each of your stocks, to negate a move in any direction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 10:21:05'] First off, this isnt a "potential" bear market. It is one. Secondly, the problem with buy and hold "strategies" is that you really have no way to know when to sell...and there is always a time to sell. Paying taxes sucks I know.1.) Tax loss harvesting2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.Theres an "Inverse Cramer" ETF coming online next month.Fortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.So step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out. Then overlay the above suggestions to tweak how much beta you want to this market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 19:08:56'] Options are only tradable during regular market hours, not extended trading, and there may not have been liquidity at that strike for the price you listed it. You have to remember the price it's quoted is the median of the spread, so you might need to look at the last trade price to see something closer to what's actually moving. You can try setting a limit order to sell to close and then bump it down by a penny until it fills.

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-02 13:08:45'] Vega tends to be higher on larger underlyings therefore you must becareful of volatility risk when you trade long options. Generally, long calls will tend to make money on delta not vega. Long puts makes money on vega and delta. Vega or volatility tends to increase when the share price drops and decreases when the share price increases or goes up. For example if you have been trading amazon short puts, you‚Äôll end up with many Porsche cars and a few houses. Why? Probability of short puts are higher than long calls. 1. You collect short vega when the share price increases and if it stays otm, you collect full credit. If you don‚Äôt have $20,000 laying around, to reduce long call risk, you can simply buy a back month itm call and sell a front month otm call or a poor mans covered call. You‚Äôll get long theta, long vega and long delta, or if you don‚Äôt have that capital laying around. Simply buying a bull call or selling a bull put will atleast hamper some long call risk by hedging with a higher strike short call or if you sell a credit spread and if it stays otm you collect full premium.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-26 10:31:50'] You probably wont see a particularly large run up in iv before earnings since this option is for march and earnings uncertainty tends to already be accounted for in iv.  Youre more likely to benefit from nvidia moving dramatically than IV increase, imo.  Also keep in mind that you are now fighting theta decay from all sides in the interim.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 13:43:30'] >If I had exited at the top, just twice in the past, I would have $10 millionI think you have a problem with managing expectations. You need to set profit targets and stick to them. The people who run an account from $10k to $100k do so because they hit a stretch of unbelievable luck combined with the complete inability to exit a trade. It's the same reason almost all of those people run those $100k accounts back down to $10k. I've seen it a thousand times.It takes discipline to be successful over the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 13:05:57'] The problem is your strategy and position sizing. In order to see these huge gains you are making huge bets (relative to your account size) and low probability but ultra high reward positions. You shouldn‚Äôt be risking more than 5% of your account value on any one trade. (That is a very rough number, but my sense is you are betting your entire account on each trade which is why you are getting wiped out.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 14:04:36'] This reminds me of the saying - "When you fail to plan then you plan to fail . . ."BEFORE opening the trade determine a profit and loss exit point and then get out when that hits.  You will only get the highest returns by coincidence as no one can ever tell where the "top" is, but no one ever went broker closing early for a smaller profit.  If you think you're leaving too much profit on the table, then change the plan and track your progress.You have a gambler's mindset and this will result in losing money over the long term.  Make thousands of trades averaging even small profits per trade and you will do well.  Trying to hit home runs on each trade will find you striking out a lot . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 16:12:21'] One thing I learned through the years is to take profit progressively on winning trades. Then leave a few runners to satisfy your gambling urge, but set a trailing stop. Never let a winning trade turn into a loser because you wanted more.Also position sizing helps keep your account healthy. Dont bet 100% of your portfolio on a single trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 20:52:26'] We're all guilty of this at some point or another, top ticking is nearly impossible. If you're honest with yourself it's greed, I am just as guilty. I recently bought contracts for 0.35 ($35) watched them go to being worth over $400 the next day... the euphoria sets in. How high could this go?! I ended up staring at it for 15 minutes as the ticker price bar coded sideways then dropped a little. I ended up selling around the 1.80ish range.It really wasn't the small price drop that hurt the value of the contracts... it was when the IV (implied volatility) dried up from the sideways price action. Best I can figure is, if IV is 400-500% and the price action is starting to taper off its probably time to sell before IV crush happens. Or sell part of your position and leave a few contracts floating "just in case" but locking in most of your gains is important. Fighting that greed isn't easy.It's great you're buying close to the money but as far as weekly contracts go, I've never had any luck holding past Wednesday. Just some thoughts from my own experience. It sounds like your doing better than I am as far as wins. Maybe just keep an eye on the IV and see if it doesn't help quell that urge to hold out for more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 17:03:50'] Research and start using following stops.  You may get stopped out before the top but will have profit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 20:53:56'] Let's say you have 10 puts, sell half when you're up, like for example, your value spikes when the market opens, sell half at whatever profit, 20% 50% 100%, doesn't matter.  That's profit.  Then you can let the rest ride and close them out when you want.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 17:29:36'] You could capture almost all of those gains, by setting a max loss target, and just stop loss your trade once you make it.I will not lose more than 10%. Set stop loss at 10%. Instead of 500%, you make a 490% gain.Your stop loss needs to be something you're comfortable enough losing, but big enough it fits your strategy without undermining you. If you've seen 13% falls before the rise, maybe 15%. Maybe 5%. That's up to you.If there isn't really an underlying strategy and you're just 'winging' it, then you're gambling. And the house always wins eventually.This is from the viewpoint that it's better to lose 10% and miss out, than it is to lose 100% from FOMO.

It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec 21).\n\nThe big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.\n\nThe 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 14:38:43'] watch out on FDX, although it seems priced in like how NFLX previewed their earnings, SNAP still dropped even more after dropping from previously lowering guidance too. But i do agree that there‚Äôs a chance of green for FDX. WMT only beat cuz they lowered guidance so bad. Short Strangle seems good on FDX, or selling a put and a call spread to limit risk on the upside. For NIO didn‚Äôt you also follow options flow? Not trying to bag on you or anything, just playing devil‚Äôs advocate in order to test your conviction on the ideas. My thoughts are that we will derisk going into CPI. I compare the current situation to the June CPI were we tanked hard before. After inflation had not peaked, that killed the bull thesis imo for the next few months. 100bps started getting priced in so now there‚Äôs fear. What I think will happen is that Jpow says 75bps, we rally hard, remember it‚Äôs always the first few moves that are the fake one, and then dump the next day as it is also VIX expiration. He could also mention that they will consider 100bps so i‚Äôm going to be extra cautious if there‚Äôs like 2-3 fake out moves. will be monitoring how much 100bps is priced in and going to be on the look out for CPI leaksI am also jacked to the tits on Monday and Wednesday puts that I bought on Friday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 15:48:10'] The problem for me is there's always fake outs during the day of CPI release or next.

POST_TEXT: b"Been trading options now for 8+ months (and actually up over 20% year to date).  Moved from covered calls and cash-secured puts to vertical spreads for a number of reasons.  Vertical spreads (interested in primarily credit spreads) are margin products and therefore expose me to the patterned day trading (PDT) designation.\n\nI use Fidelity whose PDT designation is a permanent lifetime label as opposed to other brokers who just impose the label for a 90-day duration - during which you can only trade cash only.  As a safety precaution, I'm looking to have ....\n\n* A backup account available at another broker - probably think or swim, to move to, if I screw up and get tagged with the PDT label at Fidelity.\n\n* Only open 1 and no more than 2 positions a day - so that I can limit my 4 strikes within a week (never wanting to exercise #5) thereby always being able to make an emergency exit.\n\n* I prefer to use 5DTE options, but it appears going out to 2 weeks (~10DTE +/- ) would provide some addit"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 05:54:06'] It sounds like you are being very successful, congrats!Why not just get your account above $25K where the PDT doesn't matter and won't affect your trading?  Not sure what your account size is, but at even $1K profit per week it should take a relatively short time to get to $25K and then you're free to trade how you want . . .

The Dow is up 3.5%, the S&P 500 has jumped 4.2%, and the Nasdaq, which had the worst 2022 of the three indices, is up 5.9%. Even though the Federal Reserve has stuck with its plan to keep raising rates to bring inflation down, recent data show consumer prices cooling off, even as the job market remains robust. While investors await the Feds next rate decision, on Feb. 1, in the meantime they will be processing the first wave of quarterly earnings reports. Several big banks reported Friday, as did Delta Air Lines. Tuesday brings more banks before the bell (see below) and United Airlines after the close. Procter and Gamble and Netflix report Thursday.

POST_TEXT: b'## Market View\n\n**Last Week **SPY was higher by about 1.5% in a wildly volatile week. Stocks saw a large two-day relief rally to begin the week as treasury yields declined, and hopes rose that the Fed was beginning to see evidence that would allow them to slow their aggressive rate hikes. Those hopes were dashed on Friday as the NFP report came in hot. Those numbers are notoriously backward-looking and even if it was the last hot payrolls report, markets seem to decide, that the Fed has cover for continued aggressive rate hikes for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe move on the week was inside what options were pricing but the swings in either direction during the week were way outside.\n\n**This Week **SPY options are again pricing about a 2.9% move for the upcoming week.

I am leaning bearish (pun intended) on the earnings because 1) It is a discretionary spending item that, I assume, would be nixed from people's lists of things to spend money on during a recession; 2) The impact of supply chain issues and the China lockdown.  As per their website: "Most of our products ‚Äî including our furry friends, clothing and many accessories ‚Äî are produced in Asia, similar to the entire toy industry."   I'm thinking that those issues won't have necessarily impacted current earnings but would be indicated in their upcoming future guidance.

TGT has highest IVs of the 4 so definitely want to sell premium, but it also earned that high IV because of last two ERs.May play LOW based on initial HD reaction. GL all.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 11:16:21'] I've seen this a few times lately on the flow where some really huge money has been buying deep ITM puts (or calls at times). However, it doesn't seem to have the same affect on the market in the short term as OTM options. These all have near term expirations on 1/20 so it would be assumed that they are looking for some movement in the near future. However in the last 30 minutes since these the stocks and SPY/ES has done nothing but go up. They are clearly opening orders since they are all above OI and institutional. I understand that using the deep ITM strategy allows for directional plays with less capital and takes theta decay mostly out of the picture, but the market doesn't move with them at all every time I see them. I'm struggling to understand the directional bias of Deep ITM puts apparently. Can someone help explain?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 20:58:59'] SPY is most liquid especially as you move deeper out of the money, but SPX and XSP have section 1256 tax advantages and is settled in cash with no early assignment risk.  XSP and SPY are similar in size, SPX is 10x XSP. If you‚Äôre trading XSP the bid/ask can be wide so plan on closing out trades manually at the midpoint.If you‚Äôre looking for the futures market instead for options best to start small with MES as it‚Äôs as liquid as SPY.  I never found 0DTE with futures very profitable strategy wise.  SPY works best in a tax deferred account like an IRA rather than a cash account.  I tend to trade section 1256 eligible options in my cash account with margin.  The slippage on XSP does add up but the 60/40 tax structure makes up for it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 12:16:25'] The brokers track these and it can be different based on which broker you use.  In most cases, options do not qualify for wash sales when using different stikes and dates, but this is up to the broker.  My question to you in this situation is are you concerned if you could not write off a $100 loss on your 2022 taxes and might have to wait until your 2023 taxes?  Wash sales are one of the most misunderstood aspects of trading.  Read the post below and check your broker statement to see if you even have any of these before getting too worked up about them.  Keep in mind that you don't lose the ability to write off the loss, but based on how you handle it may have to delay it.[https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/otbv84/wash\_sales\_explained\_and\_why\_they\_do\_not\_matter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/otbv84/wash_sales_explained_and_why_they_do_not_matter/)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 12:19:57'] A wash sale occurs  you purchase (or short) a ‚Äúsubstantially identical‚Äù security or option within a 60 day window around the date that you realize a loss. That's 30 days before and 30 days after the loss. All that means is that the lost is deferred as you increase the cost basis of the second purchase by the amount of the loss. When you close the second position cleanly (assuming no add'l WSV), you get to deduct the original loss.    The problem is that 'substantially identical' is not clearly defined by the IRS.     Here is information from 3 web sites that I deem worthwhile:    http://greentradertax.com/tax-treatment-for-trading-options/    https://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/capital-gain/wash/wash-sales-and-options/    https://www.tradelogsoftware.com/resources/wash-sales/

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 09:26:02'] Selling puts in a bear market takes balls. Or stupidity. Or maybe those are the same thing?I'm frankly surprised you ever made money selling puts on those straight-down tickers this year. How did you select strikes (what delta?) and what DTE?I'm not a fan of rolling for the sake of rolling. You need to have ever increasing confidence in the probability and size of profit to roll. Like if your original goal was a 70% chance to make $100, if you roll, you need to have an 80% chance to make $120 (net of the loss on the roll, so if you opened for a $100 credit then had to pay $169 to close for a -$69 loss, you have to make $189 on the new contract to net a $120 credit on the roll), and if you roll again, a 95% chance to make $150 (net net).More about rolling here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourroll

I'm assuming you should always shoot for strikes that have a decent amount of volume and open interest to make sure you can get in and out, is that correct?Also, should we look for ones that have good volume, open interest, and a pretty decent "delta"?  Maybe close to 0.7 or higher?Again, I'm a complete newb here, but just spitballing a few questions your way to see if I can continue to learn.Thanks for any advice.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 20:29:41'] Careful. I've been buying NVDA since it was $55.   Earnings always beat, but price always falls and takes awhile to recover. Analysts are never happy with results for growth stocks - never high enough.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 23:29:27'] At the moment I'm selling calls on every show I have. But whether you do that or not is up to you. If you think you can avoid the risk of assignment, go ahead and do it. So far I have not had assignment of the Microsoft and Nvidia shares. I think with a short remaining time that I will.But yes, I am facing assignment on McDonald's shares this week. On Tuesday the stock price popped $5 from out of nowhere,  I was using a 20% delta and the IV was in the 30s. Thought it was safe. If you get an unexpected price pop, it can happen.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 01:52:46'] Tech is pretty much beaten down. Selling covered calls here has not a good risk-reward ratio, because with every day that we fall further, the chances of a bullish reversal increase.If a rebound happens, you're almost certain to lose your stock as your calls expire ITM.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 22:41:52'] My purpose with covered calls in my portfolio is to draw some level of safe income. Have weekly covered calls on both Microsoft and Nvidia expiring 5/27/22. For Microsoft I sold open  Monday with a delta of about .20.  The IV was in the '50s. For NVIDIA I sold with a delta of .05. Today, before earnings, the IV was in the 130's.  I was wondering if a .05 delta would be low enough.  Turns out it was plenty. Don't have ROKU.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 03:19:00'] There's basically three scenarios:* You believe the companies are in trouble, and the prices aren't likely to recover. Then sell and deploy your capital elsewhere.* You believe the companies are fine and prices will rebound, but it will take awhile. Then sell covered calls that expire before you think the rebound will happen.* You're a bull and you believe prices will rally any day now. Then hold the shares you have, and consider buying more.I suppose there's a fourth scenario:* You don't have much experience investing in a bear market and you don't know what to expect. Then sell everything and buy total market index funds.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 23:16:57'] It‚Äôs a strategy. You just keep rolling the call into the next cycle when the stock gets to strike price.  Or you can roll it down in the same cycle if the stock drops for more credit.  The problem is if the stock drops you‚Äôll never keep up with the loss by selling calls.  It‚Äôs. Better to sell synthetic covered calls by selling itm put at the same strike you would sell your covered call without owning shares.  It‚Äôs cheaper to roll down the put to lower you cost basis than to cost average down with shares.   You can roll the put up with the rise in stock price.  Same position and risk as buying and holding shares. But cheaper to fix when it goes against you.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:38:16'] No, I'd buy more shares at a discount. That's assuming my time horizon is greater than 5 years, which is always the case when I take share positions (apart from CCs in a Wheel).If you are holding shares for upside potential, why would you cap that upside potential with a CC? If you don't believe the stock can make you a lot more money by holding, just dump the shares and find something better to do with the capital.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:48:25'] I love selling CC's but it takes some exp to get down a good plan with them, imo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:51:23'] yeah, sell weekly upside OTM CCs against the shares. With this market, can be a little aggressive with delta of 0.35\~0.45 to bring the weekly income. I posted this on other thread the other day, someone thinks I'm crazy. I bet he is the one buying my OTM calls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:57:27'] I've been taught that you don't sell covered calls on a stock you 100% want to keep a long position on. The point of the option is that it could be exercised. So, the certainty of wanting to keep the underlying stock makes offering it up beyond the determined risk threshold, in that case. When it's instead a preference to keep the stock, the risk threshold has changed, because you don't 100% want to keep it, just a preference. So, you would need to weigh out the risk/reward in your portfolio given the current market. Others have covered that part, and I'm no where near an expert, so I'll leave that determination alone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 10:06:07'] Covered calls for Roku would be unwise because you could lose out on a ton of upside from favorable news (sub growth, margin improvement, EPS surprise, M&A rumors, etc.)Covered calls for the others make a lot more sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 10:51:44'] Your decision would have to be based upon a deeper analysis that would require you to know what your target return is for the equity, and reasoned technical and fundamental opinion on the issue's expected movement. Armed with this information selection of strike and expiration will probably improve, or maybe it will suggest that selling a call on the stock wouldn't be wise at this time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 11:16:58'] Microsoft, steady mover and more predictable for covered calls. Lots of data points for good strike prices. But like everyone is saying this is risky right now with the bullish trend possibly forming so you have to manage your strike
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 11:32:48'] It's tempting but also risky. We're in an environment where the market can randomly rally 10% or more in a matter of days. If that happens you'll be completely blown out. If you're wanting to keep your shares then it's not the best idea.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 12:26:56'] Yes. And make sure you‚Äôre selling above your basis so if you‚Äôre assigned you don‚Äôt take a big loss.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 12:49:23'] I don‚Äôt plan on covering any of my tech stocks down here. I will think about it if we get a 10-20% bounce. I‚Äôm not trying to lock in a loss for a few dimes on stocks I am down 30-40%. I missed about 10k of upside on TWTR because I was selling covered calls on it when Elon disclosed his buy. You never know when there could be news. If you liked the companies at higher prices, don‚Äôt try to make it all back right away but cutting off your upside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 18:36:10'] You are right. In general I don't like to let the shares go. With MCD I decided to take a profit. Want to start putting $$ toward klac and amat. For 40 years my retirement account has been overweighted tech. I can't be beat up any worse than I have already been so I am simply going to concentrate on that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 19:10:18'] Yes, but only during peaks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 19:14:01'] Selling calls is considered bearish. Selling puts is bullish.You want them to expire worthless
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 23:49:35'] Strategy will depend on the market trend! It‚Äôs a bear market. So every rally will probably sell off. In this situation, selling covered calls would help lock in some profits
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-27 05:39:22'] I think selling covered calls to generate income is a great idea, esp if those are positions you want to hold long term (it seems they are in this case). Small mistakes can make a big impact once you‚Äôre in the trade so plan ahead & be careful‚Äînever know what Bi-Polar market might suddenly decide to do. Many people will offer quick advice, some of it will be good, some will be bad.The potential $ impact to your account over time could be large, for better or worse. It‚Äôs definitely worth taking such trades seriously. I‚Äôm not a pro, but here‚Äôs a few things worth mentioning from the perspective of a call seller.Pick a good entry point, sell the right strike.  Don‚Äôt pick these randomly or in haste because of falling stock price pain.Be ready (& be able) to actively manage/adjust the position.Close the trade (buy back the calls) BEFORE they expire. No matter how unlikely something might seem, a few pennies/dollars is NOT worth an unpleasant surprise at 0DTE or a few days from expiry. This was a lesson I had to learn the hard way even after being taught to know better. ‚ÄúMost calls expire worthless‚Äù is a saying that gets echoed, but that doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. You (& every other option buyer/seller out there) have the ability to close (i.e. Sellers can buy back & Buyers can sell) a trade at any point before expiry. Hopefully this provides enough context to understand the point. Buying/Selling calls does NOT mean you‚Äôre stuck in your choice until expiration. Options offer tremendous flexibility & leverage. Learning to use them properly & responsibly takes time & focus. It‚Äôs worth learning.30-45 days is considered by many to be about the right amount of time to sell options in most situations.Context & conditions matter. Things can change quickly and big moves can happen when you least expect them. Have a plan. I know, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face‚Äîit‚Äôs still better to have one than not. Be especially careful taking advice from anyone claiming a trade like this is simple/easy. It‚Äôs your money and NOBODY will care about it the way that you do. I paid for an options course (which included an active trader community) a while back that was actually really great. If you‚Äôre planning to place many of these trades over time, it‚Äôd definitely be worth considering some help like that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 01:10:52'] MSFT leaps is the "safer" alternative and I'll explain. AMD relies solely on PC hardware. AAPL majority revenue relies solely on iphones, ipads & iwatch. If there is any new competitor that comes out with something better and challenges either company, they're fucked.MSFT is what I call jack of all trades master of none. They're in home computers, office software, cloud computing & storage, gaming, VR, etc etc. Any of these division could take a massive hit and the company will still churn out profits.

POST_TEXT: b"In previous to my last SPY post that netted a lot of people 10k+\n\nI thought I would share my upcoming moves and plays for the run into December.\n\nI will not be updating this as much I have done in my previous posts because I am trying to save more of my intraday ideas to people who join my Discord. (Edit: For everyone asking, I charge for my Discord. If you can make 10k-60k off my plays, you can afford $35 a month for me.)\n\nNevertheless, I will post what I am going to be watching and positions I will be taking in the coming month.\n\nLCID-LongReasoning: LCID has a fanbase like TSLA (you gay bears are about to find out) . I also believe it's going to become the baby brother of TSLA.\n\n1.5B order book. 2nd most voted EV stock AHEAD of RIVN right under TSLA. Also, read the daily chart. I believe it's going to shoot past 60 this week. Spike of OI on Friday at the $48 c 11/26. I do NOT like weekly's, but this would be a solid play. Safer play is ATM 55c one month out.\n\nCant get long if we drop"

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 04:49:38'] Few reasons I would stay away from options besides a few tickers:1) Most have high IV right now which means you‚Äôre paying extra premium 2) Nobody is certain of anything. I would be very careful trying to use history as a means of certainty. Times are a lot different now than they were a couple decades ago.Just buy shares. In fact, you should actively be adjusting your strategy according to the market. Right now is a good time for shorter positions imo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 18:57:36'] I will tell you all the best and easiest trading strategy to build wealth. This is a strategy that only 0.1% of all WSB use, it‚Äôs very rare in the autist community. 1. Find good companies with strong moats and strong leadership - buying back stock is also something I would look for (AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Meta, VTI)2. Buy shares with all your disposable income for the next decade. Try and buy on dips when possible. Don‚Äôt be Cathie wood. Only buy with money you don‚Äôt need for 10x years. 3. Don‚Äôt waste time staring at your account. Check in every now and then but don‚Äôt do anything. Just buy dips when you can. And re-invest all dividends. 4. Focus your time on work and creating value for yourself. Don‚Äôt waste time trying to time the market or dwelling on paper losses or gains. 5. In 10x years, your account will have tripled (at least) and you can start taking some off the top to buy shares in up and coming great companies. Hold those, don‚Äôt sell, and check it again it 10 years. Rinse and repeat. Never buy options. Don‚Äôt panic and sell. Just add and hold, has worked for the last 100 years and will work for the next 100 years unless there is a nuclear war and if that happens who cares, we are all fucked.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 00:31:03'] It‚Äôs a great time to buy LEAPS, because the delta will offset the high vega. They are pricey right now, so try to calculate your profit based on a pure intrinsic value play where you deduct the premium you paid. If this doesn‚Äôt net enough profit given your price target, then it‚Äôs better to buy stocks. I look for LEAPS with IV preferably <40%, with a max of IV 80% on stocks where I expect high delta to offset the expensive extrinsic value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-08 23:59:52'] I‚Äôm buying leaps on companies that got beat way down with the market that I like.

Everything was going great, at one point my cost basis was down to $15.50 and I was up like 40%. And then the Russian bs happened. I have no idea why I didnt sell other than outright greed. The week before I had finished doing the math and calculated that with about 50 trades, maxing out margin, and earning about $0.30 per trade with Aal, I could more or less 4-5x my money. Your can probably guess where this is heading. \n\nI sold everything and went all in on Aal at 16.13. I didnt even max out my margin which pissed me off initially..

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 06:30:39'] After doing what you just did, you want to give me advice?Nah bro, I'm good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 07:11:40'] You may have been right about the strategy, the direction, etc. but all of that is null and void the moment you used money you couldnt afford to lose (margin) and didn't have a safety net by leaving your work. It's an unfortunate lesson, but ultimately on the bright side you - hopefully - won't make the same mistake again in regards to almost maxing out your margin and playing with margin calls. If you feel confident in your strategy, re-deploy but with only money you can afford to lose. Also unless you have a nest egg built up, relying on the *market* which can be the most unpredictable but accessible wealth-building tool ever built, I would really re-think your decision to stop work / cutting off a reliable source of income.Sorry if this sounds preachy, I don't mean it to be. Hope it works out for you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 08:38:31'] Don‚Äôt use margin. You clearly don‚Äôt know how.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 07:55:44'] My number one rule is Live to trade another day This goes hand in hand with the most common rookie mistake: Trading too bigDoesn‚Äôt matter how good the idea, the stock, if there a chance that a person loses everything, it is almost inevitable. In your case it was maybe 10 or 20 percent chance per month of a margin call. Knowing that, it is only gambling to go all in on margin on that kind of play. Even if you were much more conservative and there was only a five percent chance of margin call each month, you‚Äôd be lucky to last a year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 10:36:58'] I think the right balance is work your regular job, maybe for a few less hours a week. In the mean time, do options on the side. I‚Äôve been doing the same but I haven‚Äôt cut my hours yet. Keeping my portfolio small and strategies safe. Not using margin‚Äî only cash secured and covered positions so at the end of the day, I still have an asset that may appreciate in time so at least there‚Äôs the opportunity of digging myself out of a hole (even if it is delayed). I‚Äôve been wheeling AAL since New Years so that‚Äôs mainly why I‚Äôm reading your post. This the first time I‚Äôm trying this out. AAL is almost a 7% return in the 3.5 months so it is my least profitable position. Hoping to get out at a profit soon and redirect those funds to a blue chip. Sorry about your position, hope you figure it out. If I ever get back in, it‚Äôll have to be around the $12 range again
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 05:47:12'] Ouch man. That‚Äôs kind of crazy. I just trade with money I don‚Äôt necessarily need right now. And I def would never quit my job to live off trading full time. That way too much pressure. This sounds like Russian roulette tbh. There‚Äôs always risk with margin you just have to be strong enough not to go in all the way it can ruin you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 10:20:57'] I think maybe this would be a good time to explore why you were so confident in the trade. I would ask why I bet so much even when warned by others.This isn‚Äôt an issue of being smart or dumb‚Äî it‚Äôs greed and / or arrogance. Unless you actively work to change your attitude, you might make the same mistake again.

POST_TEXT: b'The recent correction has taken my NVDA and AMD LEAPS deep into the red. I didnt have a stop loss management on them which is my first learning lesson but given my confidence in the stocks, Im not sure that I would have done that anyway.

The reason Im posting is to see if there is anything else that I can or should be doing right now while I wait for them to resurface?\n\nEDIT: Ive appreciated all the feedback. For those who are discussing averaging down by buying more LEAPS (which Im strongly considering given my faith in the underlying), pay attention to the IV in relationship to the underlying. AMD IV is high in relationship to where it typically is. If I understand this right, its a great time to sell opinions (CC) but buying options might be a little too expensive. If Im wrong on this understanding of IV, Im open to learnin'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 14:10:56'] Are these leap call options? if so what strikes and what purchase price?first thing I would do is dont rely on the belief they will recover. This will lead you to not being able to cut if you need to. Options are all or nothing trades as time is not on your side.You can always sell calls below your original strike price and use them to buy put spread or shorter dated call spreads. Just be cognizant that these are considered new positions that is using your long leap as protection.Alternatively, you can also take a L on some of your position or w.e you find acceptable and leave the rest .
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 14:51:00'] Not much you can do with a long LEAPS call deeply in loss other than close it.Think about it this away.  Because of put-call parity, the LEAPS call is equivalent to being long the stock and long the out of the money put at the same strike.Because the downside protection is similar to that long-dated out of the money put, it provides very little protection on a price decline until the stock falls so far that it approaches the strike.LEAPS calls are frequently used to leverage up price exposure on a stock with limited capital.  Works great on the way up, sucks on the way down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 15:35:01'] If you‚Äôre confident in the stocks, buy more? Either that or just hold and wait.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 15:36:06'] How about the stock repair strategy? If you think the the underlying will move up in the next 45-60 days, then maybe the stock repair strategy could help. Basically, instead of selling 1 call for 100 shares (as in covered call), you buy 1 ATM call and sell 2 OTM calls per 100 shares (or 1 LEAPs in your case). You will speed up the recovery to your break even if the underlying keeps moving up.Details here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/repair-strategy.asp
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 04:45:56'] I have scanned these and it seems the consensus is hold, it'll come back.  None of us know that for sure.  Have you thought about just taking the loss now while it is still somewhat salvageable?  You've gone from ITM to OTM right quick and you have earnings coming up as well, which are typically crap shoots, especially lately.  Are you willing to hold if AMD sells off another 20%?  What's your exit plan in that scenario?  On the flip side, they could have killer earnings and your LEAPS go from red to breakeven, or even profitable overnight depending on how things shake out.  A lot of things to think about.This is why I am thinking if you are going to run a covered call strategy, it seems almost worth it to be doing it with shares instead.  I understand the leverage aspect is taken away and the loss on shares is always 1:1 but on an option it can be buffered a bit.  The bonus with the shares is the time component is negated and you don't have a breakeven cost over the current cost you have to claw back.Lots of thinking to do coming up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 13:59:31'] I‚Äôm holding 40% down AMD Jan LEAPS also. Honestly just hold, I think we‚Äôve hit a floor here. AMD is gonna have a solid year, I‚Äôm honestly not really paying attention to it again till June.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 20:25:06'] You mentioned not having a stop loss - I think a stop loss on a leap with low liquidity would be nuts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 21:05:34'] It all depends on your belief in the underlying.  I have to mention Apple all the time. My March ‚Äò23 120c calls I bought at 27 were at 18 in February/March ‚Äò21 right after I purchased and I bought more.   I know it‚Äôs tough, but if you have a target and have 3-4 more earnings cycles, stick with it
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 00:29:09'] When it comes to LEAPS always always always DCA.  Lump sum ceases to become an option due to LEAPS having an expiration date and needing to be rolled, so you always want to DCA.So what your previous LEAPS are down?  Right now is the ideal time to buy LEAPS.  Keep DCAing and in the long run it will average out.Generally you don't want to sell LEAPS except 45 days before expiration.  I wouldn't even roll them, just buy new ones every two weeks (ie DCA) and ignore the old ones.  If your broker allows it set your existing LEAPS to auto sell.  This way psychologically it becomes closer to buying stock or an LETF which takes a lot of the work out of it and increases your chances of success.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 19:28:29'] I personally would close at least 80% of each position and look to re-enter when market retraces back up, providing that there is still a lower high being formed. Take a look at SPY and NAS100 to get an idea of how the overall market is doing. They are currently bearish on most time frames and have made a new low on the weekly time frame. With this being said it should be retracing up before falling again (I have SPY possibly coming down to 380s and then possibly retracing to the 430s and then falling from there on the weekly time frame).
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:34:36'] I bought bearish index verticals at the end of last year.  On big down days like today, I book gains by rolling the long legs down (maybe 6 times now). On rallies, I roll the short legs down. By now, my spreads are diagonals and I'm wheeling nearer month puts against farther out months.     Do I know where the market is going?  Haven't a clue.  I think down but that doesn't matter because I'm reacting to price change, not predicting it.  I'm starting to wonder about buying some calls for a rebound but I don't see that happening yet.  If/when I do, I'll wheel on both sides.Thoughts for you?  If still bearish, roll your long puts down. Book gains and lock in profits.   If reducing your negative delta troubles you, ratio roll down.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/uo06tf/wheel_strategy_gone_wrong/'
POST_TEXT: b'Hey everyone,\n\nSo I traded options for a few months and I was doing okay, until I decided to take a break and adopt a "wheel" strategy. I was basically selling Facebook and Nvidia puts and I was going to sell calls on them at around the same strike price or slightly lower. \n\nHowever the first week I did that I got assigned NVDA at 257.5$, and FB 225$. As you may know, NDA is now 160$\n\nMy FB is down too but not doing as bad; I am down 3k on the stock but was able to make 2k in premium, and will continue making some premium until it eventually gets called away. \n\nI\'m not sure what to do as the best play. I\'ve bought a short term lower strike price put to protect my NVDA from crashing "too" much, and I\'m selling some calls but premiums around the prices of 250$ or even 240$ are basically null. \n\nShould I sell lower strike calls to try to make some premium (200-220$ strike) at the risk of getting it called away, or should I still sell (much) cheaper 250$ calls at basically almost no return'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 12:10:24'] The cardinal rule of the wheel is to trade only stocks you would willing to hold, for months if needed.  It is bizarre you were assigned the first week!  Did you sell the puts 30-45 dte?  Did you try to roll the puts to get more premiums and delay assignments?  While the wheel works best in neutral and bullish markets, the worst that can happen is you end up owning some stocks you don't mind owning.No one can know when the market or any stocks may rebound, so sit tight and hold these shares until they come back up.  We've seen markets tank like this and then move back up relatively fast sometimes.  If your analysis on the stock is still positive, and you have the capital plus adding more shares would not make any stock too much risk to the account, then I will sometimes sell more puts to keep premiums coming in which lowers the net stock cost of the shares.  Rolling these to avoid assignment, but if assigned then this will average down the net stock cost quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 05:57:17'] You‚Äôre not alone.  I‚Äôm finding the wheel strategy only works when the market goes sideways or up.  I‚Äôm seeing some huge losses with the recent market down turn.  The only thing working for me right now is buying puts and day trading deep OTM options.   Everything I‚Äôm running the wheel strategy on is in the red and not sure if I should continue to bag hold or just cut my losses at this point.  We‚Äôll see how this week goes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 06:30:08'] Once you make up your mind, it will feel better. Saying that as I'm in the same position as you with WBD. In my mind, I've recognized it as a loss so any premium made will be a gain for me. Hope this helps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 10:16:59'] I am not sure who coined the term 'wheel' but it is basically selling puts (maybe it is marketing).For example, if XYZ is $100 and you sell a $90 put, if it expires, you made the entire premium. If you get assigned you own the stock at $90. Then you sell a call against your stock. It is a covered call which is the equivalent position to a synthetic short put.If the underlying will trades sideways or up, then selling puts should work out (because your short options are going to expire worthless). If the underlying is going down, then this is a losing strategy because you are selling put options (or synthetic put options) on an asset that depreciates.If you think about it this way, then the only time you would want to do this is when the underlying is going sideways or up. Right now, most underlyings (including the major indexes) all all going down. Thus, selling puts is not going to be the brightest thing to do.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 10:44:35'] Wheeling is only functional in a neutral to up market.  In a down market, it gets clobbered because it is a long delta strategy.  These boards are littered with peeps who thought that the market would cooperate forever.If you've been hammered, learn about risk management.  Spreads is a good place to start.&#x200B;For example, if you had done a $250/$230 spread on NVDA, at $160, your long leg would be   worth $70 and the total loss would be less than $20.  With those numbers, you're still in the game with the ability to sell reasonably OTM calls..
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 06:32:02'] The point is to keep selling calls for peanuts until the price gets back. Why change the strategy because you are uncomfortable with the outcome so far?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 07:32:14'] Wheeling is not for volatile environments
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 17:22:51'] People keep  saying only wheel stocks you do not mind owning but never just say the reason is if the stock has any quality it will eventually go up.  But that means that if you are doing the wheel for short term strategy it might not work which is most of the people that start saying wheel gone "wrong".   It did not go wrong it is being used wrong.   In my opinion willing to own means long term like buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 07:23:47'] Keep selling calls at your cost basis even if the premiums are peanuts. Hopefully you are long on NVDIA/FB, which will make it an easier task mentally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 09:18:22'] Wheeling is not a good strategy, you‚Äôre better off selling credit spreads
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 16:01:09'] You want to wheel on sideways trading stocks. I've been wheeling on Intel and I think I'm getting assigned at 43.. But I was selling the 40 delta put.. Now Ill be selling the 43$ call...Facebook and Nvidia would be a good spread or leaps stock.. Although put leaps right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 19:12:16'] The wheel only works in a sideways and bull market. Stop watching guys on YouTube about making consistent returns wheeling.   Your just be seriously underwater bag holding for many years
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 22:59:03'] Idk y u would think selling nvda calls at 250 makes any sense, as they r 90$ away from current price‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not the smartest person in the room but u really really should be selling closer to 190-170$ strikes. Like r u even trying to make back ur lost money ? Or r u just selling calls for selling calls sake?. To me it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to sell so out of the money. Just because ur assigned at 257.5 doesn‚Äôt mean u have to sell around that. But that‚Äôs just my opinion‚Ä¶Edit: also looking at the nvda chart I see most of the drop is very recent, so maybe a little stupid of me to judge, but in my honest opinion we r not going to see any sort of massive rally for some time. I think there definitely will be a little bump up with in the next 2-3 weeks. But none of these big players r going more then 10% up and then slowly will fall again until a true bull catalyst comes, like Russia Ukraine ending, china lockdown ending or something else that is really big. So I‚Äôd say go for 190 maybe 200$ strike for the 30-45 day but going any higher is a bit silly as, it‚Äôs not really worth ur time. What I do is buy back the option at 50% profit and wait til a Green Day and sell again. But everyone has there own risk tolerance.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 16:52:35'] I would sell puts on spy more so than qqq. Its less volatile. And if i get called, i try to sell monthly calls rather than weeklies or super short term. You can have a better gauge of price fluctuations by looking at the peaks/valleys over the course of the month including the 20/50 days moving avgs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 17:13:08'] "The best, most lucrative stock to sell covered calls on" are those that have the highest implied volatility and share price NEVER goes down.  Good luck finding those.

Do it with stocks you are ok being called as long as you are profitable. Never do it with your core portfolio holdings. And yes do it with the stocks that you understand and are in your related field of expertise. Enjoy.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi All!\n\nKeen to ask for feedback and experience stories on this topic. Im not an expert by any means, but especially in this market environment where I have been holding less, been putting more efforts/divesting in selling Puts during earnings releases.\n\nNote: I never ever buy calls/puts during earnings period (and never will).\n\nBeen doing very well and for instance this week, conservatively made a solid amount selling Zoom Puts (strike $60), Costco (strike $430), and NVDA (strike $130). In all cases, next morning close out for $.01-$.03 a share.\n\nSome of my criteria I use:\n\n1) Only sell contracts expiring that Friday\n\n2) Only do for earnings releases Wed/Thurs- as then close to the Friday expiry and goal is always to sell the next morning \n\n3) Of course, only for those stocks I would be happy to own (definitively) for the strike prices\n\n4) Dont get greedy and priced relatively far out (know of course exemplified ie FB, NFLX, ROKU, etc these days nothing is definitively far out)'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:16:01'] I sold CSP Cost 400 strike , BBY 150 strike NVDA 150 strike. The high volatility just before earnings is great for selling. The premium for cost  was 1000 per contract closed the next day for. 01.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:22:18'] Looks good. Seems as though you‚Äôve mapped out a trading plan and executing it. My one thought is selling naked on tickers like COST, NVDA, or other ‚Äúhigher‚Äù priced tickets presents fairly large downside risk. You made it clear you are aware of that by acknowledging the FB and NFLX earnings debacles. The questing I like to ask myself is can I handle assignment on my naked positions in the event of a black swan event? Can I simultaneously meet margin requirements in vol expansion cycle? Plan for the worst hope for the best. If properly managed early, and as long as there is enough time and extrinsic value you can roll those option from a credit perpetually to lower cost basis until profitable if your account size can facilitate that. However, in a serious draw down like in NLFX you could be left bag holding for quite a bit and have to sell covered calls against your stock position well below your basis. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre already aware of all this just something to consider as with the recent market conditions and very volatile earnings as of late have resulted in massive moves in some underlying a where assignment is inevitable when that far in the money (assuming you don‚Äôt want to roll for a large debit). Took some naked positions on higher price tickers and ended up holding after massive moves. Not unmanageable but certainly locks up your capital for longer than desired. Food for thought.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:52:55'] Plenty of good solid stocks have cratered on news. Doesn‚Äôt even have to be earnings news. The clich√© is picking up nickels in front of the steam roller. Most of the time you get the nickel. Once in a while you trip or stumble and get rolled. The bobos tell you to research and only pick good stocks. Plenty of great companies have become lousy stocks. And it just ain‚Äôt earnings that causes down moves. Go in with eyes open. Often these high probability trades involve massive losses on the few losers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:00:56'] As you have acknowledged that you are ready to get assigned, i see no issues.There is absolutely no strategy without risk but you know the risk and ready to own them I don‚Äôt see any issues here

I shall attempt to break it down for you. MU - simply a case of technical movement, and supply meets demand. You will monitor this stock if you are into technical. Volatility crush is also real for stock prices. But if you don‚Äôt believe technical and you are into fundamental, tell me you have seen it‚Äôs PE, business model, demand, profit margin, and are unconvinced of the ongoing demand.NVDA - there is a reason why some stocks keep breaking new high and some stocks keep breaking new lows. NVDA has the fundamental, acquisition expectation, product demand, and profit margin. I bought at $605 and it‚Äôs now $800. After stock split it is only going to go up higher, if previous studies of stocks‚Äô price movement after stock splits are anything to go by. AMD - i watched it since it was $60+ last year. Is it too much now? Maybe not the cheapest. But definitely not going down any moment. And I‚Äôm going vertical spread, PMCC, and naked puts with it. Majority of my options profit was from like 20+ trades on AMD, in the past 2 months. Tsm - I owned it at $63 and it‚Äôs only going to go up higher with the world‚Äôs largest producer of something that every product manufacturer needs, from aircon, to your fan and TV. In fact I‚Äôve just initiated a PMCC position with it. And you mentioned a good point about China, SMIC simply is not a business that I would want to own against Tsmc, given its current state of production capacity.

I‚Äôm sure a few slip by but overall they know which way bets will be placed and make sure it goes in the other direction or sideways as needed for their pockets. We all just have a 50/50 chance. In my opinion Nvidia was calculated to cut loose as well. They consolidated and let it fly like it would without manipulation. Now they are teasing us with AMD which will not hold up.

Until AMD can lead some aspect of tech or have a wide enough product line to bring in more revenue investors wont like into it. Traders keep the cycles going but investors push the trend up. Investor buy in happens when they see the growth potential. Thats why when they came out with ryzen the writing was on the wall and everyone bought in after the sales started to flow and deals started to be made. While AMD is clearly eating Intel‚Äôs lunch on cpus, their gpus do not compare to nvda yet and they dont even offer storage or networking solutions. They have to expand or else investors will sell off since the growth isnt there. You can def make money trading on the short term trends though amd is so cyclical

Mine personally are AAPL, XLK, FB, MSFT, SPY, QQQ, TQQQ, IWM, TNA, ZM, TSLA, SQ, QCOM, AMD, INTC, MU, BABA, NVDA, NFLX, PYPL, ROKU along with other names that get beat down technically, but remain fundamentally sound and are within the S&P100!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 15:41:27'] RKT, decent premium and the stock stays pinned between 19 and 24... I sell puts when the stock gets to 20.50 for strike price of 19 and I sell calls when the stock is above 21.50 for a strike price of 24 if the stock goes up to 22.50 I sell calls for 24/25. Right now it seems like there‚Äôs some heavy manipulation by institutions pinning the price below max-pain by 50 cents to $1 so follow the max pain for strike prices depending on expiry and you‚Äôll do well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 15:50:23'] I recently started selling tesla put spreads.  I like this strategy because tesla is incredibly volatile and can move up 100$ in a day easily.  Also the spread will net you a small delta, maybe 1 or 2 which is nice if you can't stomach 100 shares of the insanity.  Selling at to in the money spreads has been working pretty good lately.  &#x200B;Question for others, do you typically hold to expiration and hope for them end up worthless?  I always wanted the balls to do that but to me as the risk reward on the spread changes it seems stupid to risk 7 dollars to try and make 2 more; or what have you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 16:28:35'] PLTR here. So far so good.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 17:04:51'] I enjoy wheeling companies I love. TSLA, PLTR, SPCE, ARK funds. Though, I‚Äôve found premiums for ARKs haven‚Äôt been worth it as of late. Some others: LMND, CMPS, WKHS. These companies are all great and will be doing amazing down the road (except ARK and TSLA already killing it). I like to be aggressive, close to ITM on some weeks and far OTM on others ‚Äî all dependent on the week ahead. I generally trade these for the week rather than the month, so there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt much time to correct and roll. I‚Äôve lost TSLA many times and it always breaks my heart as I‚Äôve been with them since $145 presplit. I always buy back and do the same dumb thing, selling an option that somehow TSLA laughs at and hurdles over. I‚Äôve lost a few PLTR shares from this too. Generally not, as they‚Äôve been sideways for so long. Wish I knew about options when I held TSLA for years of its sideways movement. Another thing I like to do is sell puts far OTM and hold until they are ITM. Things like IPOD IPOE IPOF. That‚Äôs been good. I generally don‚Äôt sell premiums on those because they jump so high and unexpectedly that it‚Äôs not worth the risk of losing them for $5 - $30 a contract. AAPL is good for wheels as they generally don‚Äôt pop as much for far OTM. But of course the premium isn‚Äôt so $$$.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-19 14:49:04'] By far my favorite is Spx.     Why Spx?   SPX has weeklys ( MWF expirations). Highly traded so easy to get in & out of. Cash settled = nothing assigned like stocks.   In U.S. beneficial tax treatment.    Or if small account use SPY ( one tenth size of SPX ) -.  SPY does not have the tax advantages of SPX.                        My strategy is selling puts on SPX or SPY.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-25 16:50:04'] An excellent strategy is selling weekly SPX put options 1-4 DTE .   3 to 5 trades per week.    Important to have a hedge in place when and if SPX goes against you ( large downside move).   You don‚Äôt have to be glued to your screen since you monitor and place orders thru trading day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-19 07:02:16'] There's been a lot of threads like this on theta gang, and I never understood this approach of "Give me a set of tickers you like to sell on."  You should more be thinking about "What tickers are quality names (with higher than normal IV) that are currently oversold/beat down and ready for a recovery?" That's the real question. And that list should be different every month, possibly/probably every week with new names being added or removed.  Many of the names you specified are pumped up. BABA was the one for this month (on pullbacks) and end of last month (on initial gap down), but only because it got so beat down on a gap down right to long term trendline support. You want that sort of thing. FB is kinda getting there, but I'd like to see it near 200-220 to start up. All the other names are overextended i.e. you're playing with no other edge besides theta. I made a sale last week on TWTR because I like that it gapped down to daily chart support, but it's really a meh trade on my part because I think it's a total shit company with shit leadership, though I believe I've got a solid technical thesis for it on the daily and the premiums were right (6% for the 40 day 30 deltas). So it's a pure swing, and I don't plan to wheel it if it breaks support.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 10:54:38'] The NVDA 250c is the one that made me wince. Ouch, that's a nasty loss.In order:1. Have a plan **before** you put money at risk. Your [trade plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan) would tell you what to do about all of these. I daresay your plan would have said bail out of most of them sooner. Or maybe don't concentrate so much equity in tech to begin with. Did you miss the news about rising interest rates and rising inflation? Both are bad for tech.1. Compare the current prices with your forecast. If your forecast and original [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) are now wrong, update your forecast and expected value and go from there. If holding is +ev, hold. If rolling is +ev, roll. If nothing is +ev, dump.1. Next time, prioritize [risk management](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_planning). A good rule of thumb is risk no more than 5% of your total account liquidation value in any one position, and don't concentrate more than 50% of your account value in any one ticker/industry.

POST_TEXT: b'So as of late, I have been looking into selling CCs. I\'ve been doing a lot of research and have even sold a few offers the last few months, securing a small profit. The issue I am having is actually knowing what stock to pick. I have watched and read lots about CCs but this topic is usually brushed over by saying "The underlying stock should be something you are willing to own but not worried about losing to assignment."\n\n*Ok, that\'s great. but I can\'t drop $25,000 on 100 shares of NVDA.* \n\nHow can I find cheaper stocks($10-$40) that aren\'t absolute crap that I can sell CCs on? What are some technicals or fundamentals I should be looking for?\n\nThanks.\n\n*Edit, bonus question: What are your thoughts on buying shares on margin to sell CCs on? I\'ve got a whole load of margin that I have never touched. Is it wise or stupid?*'
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 16:48:06'] You could also sell pmcc. For example you need 4500 to run covered calls on kr but with pmcc you need closer to 1k.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 17:09:39'] I was trading HPE for awhile. It hovers around $15.  It‚Äôs relatively low risk, but doesn‚Äôt pay huge premiums.  It was a good starter stock for me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 16:38:43'] BAC, CLNE
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 17:02:54'] You can sell covered calls on ETFs. I can sympathize with your reluctance to own $25k of NVDA, but what about $22k of VTI?(Of course, this is probably worse than just buying and holding VTI over the long run, but that's true for selling covered calls in general.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 18:07:44'] Make sure you have enough open interest and narrow spread + good premium, considering all that you will be left with few worthy cheap stocks to trade for CC for income.If you r on the other hand just like the stock and want to own it, and use CC as source of more income, then fine.But nowadays everything is volatile which is good times to sell options.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 05:05:52'] I've been selling CC's on Ford. I think it's a great stock with huge growth potential as a legacy automaker. Every time my CC comes ITM, I just roll up and out (for credit), as I'd rather keep the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 17:36:02'] I would not use margin to sell CCs. Dividend stocks in the $30-$50 range are probably safe-ish plays. You could find just one or two that you really like, and do those. Just important to avoid selling around dividend dates (from what I‚Äôve heard)Edit: a counterpoint is a stock like T, which has been beaten down a lot even before the ‚Äòcorrection.‚Äô Dividend ETFs can be cheap and could work for selling CC‚Äôs too
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 17:57:47'] I own PG (kinda pricey right now, but owned the stonk for a long time), got KHC, PFE, F. They all have weeklies, and pays dividend (F did stop pay for a while, but now is back to paying 0.40 a year)CBP, HRL, or possibly some bank stocks? I currently don't know any of these stonks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 01:17:44'] Selling cc's on margin isn't a good idea. Robinhood has a 2.5% soon to be 3% yearly interest rate for it's margin. Can you guarantee a 3% or better return on investment for the year? Let's assume you can. Even if your yearly return was 3% or better you still have a chance of being margin called. This means your broker will sell off your assets in order to satisfy an unpaid margin if said margin falls below a certain threshold. In a volatile market 100$ could be worth 20$ then 100$ again. Margin doesn't like that. The moment your threshold is met without warning your assets are sold. And you don't get to choose which ones either. It's all in the margin disclosure that your broker has.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 16:25:44'] Some Apps like robin hood allow u to buy partial shares.. so you can have 1$ worth of Amazon for what that's worth.

POST_TEXT: b'Got absolutely torched by NVDA today. Embarrassing really. Just thought "it can\'t go down THAT much because of xyz, i\'ll just hold the small loss and hope to make some money on the call next week." Well, $1500 later, it did not get better. Also had a big ADBE loss because I panic sold. AND was actually up 1300 in the AM, then 500, but instead of taking the 500 I thought I\'d piss a whole lot away instead, I guess because I was mad at myself for not taking my original larger profit. Way more angry at myself now though.\n\nI did not close the NVDA call which expires in 2 weeks. Should I just sell asap Monday?

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-18 18:30:43'] It helps to set clear profit and loss targets before entering the trade, then have OCO orders set up to take either a profit or loss when either target is hit.Otherwise I find the trade will get away from me while I'm "thinking about it", " holding on just a little longer," etc.We are our own worst enemies.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 14:18:15'] Dude, don't sell your calls for nvda, it will be back up... The market was down 120 points and this thing was selling at +$13 still... +$30 when the market was only down 60 points... The big money took the opportunity after most options positions closed to manipulate the price back under $750 to make sure those calls didn't close in the money... It will be crazy again next week - that is unless there is a market correction that keeps Nvidia stale or even drops it a little. 14 100 seems to be a strong point of resistance for the Nasdaq. I was up $9000 @10am Friday with an $8500 stake, but only made $3300 by days end... I had 10 $760 puts I bought @2pm for $2000 and panic sold 5 mins later when it dropped to $1500... They were $15 000 an hour later... So, I feel your pain. There's always next week.

IOW, what can I do to lock in some gain or reduce the risk?  With a long call, that could be selling some of the position,  converting it to a vertical, adding some put protection, using a trailing stop loss, whatever.      If you swing for the fences, you get some big wins as well as some big whiffs as well.      Short answer?  Give some thought to your risk management.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 04:58:44'] I find that when playing short term options, I consider whatever the premium is to be lost. I then don't have to worry about closing at any specific time, only taking profits, rolling, or converting to a spread. Focusing only on upside exit reduces the stress a lot, while considering it a 100% loss causes me to risk a more appropriate amount of my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-19 08:10:33'] I would say just buy debit spreads instead so you don‚Äôt lose as much. Plus you will know what max profit is. Naked call has unlimited gain but the stock will never reach infinity. Also don‚Äôt go two weeks out, give yourself time to recover or weather the storm. Of course risk management is essential too. Like taking profits at a certain percentage of gain or cutting losses before it gets near worthless.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello,\n\n\nI would like your advice on what to do in my situation as I am in a bit of trouble\n\nI bought a msft deep itm leaps (jan 2024) when the underlying was around 330 -__- and my leaps is down about 30%\n\nI am selling ccs to collect some premium but the drawdown has been brutal.. if you were in my situation would you close the leaps for a loss, or would you hold given the expiry is Jan 2024? \n\nThank you!'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 08:51:42'] No way would I sell. You still have two years. This was the most volatile week in recent times.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 09:04:51'] You've got to be shitting me...31 times in the modern era investor sentiment has dropped to 20% positive, and 31 times out of 31 the S&P was higher in 180 days. Maybe a tank is due, but 100% of the time you've been correct if you told the herd to fuck off.In two years we could have gone through three more up/down cycles. Do not take that loss. If you want to call that "no longer registered" financial advice to sue me later, piss up a rope, but I wouldn't do it. I'd watch them go down some more and then cash in my profits when they go back up. But that's just me, so not financial advice...
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 09:07:14'] A two year leap is a long time for the market, hypothetically a deeper correction can happen a bear market can follow and you still have enough time for a bull market to come back and make money on the Jan 24 leap is like owning the stock outright time is on your side and Microsoft is one of the most profitable companies and that‚Äôs not going change anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 11:41:58'] Why can‚Äôt you wait?  You have two years to be right
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 08:55:28'] The point of LEAPS are to absorb this type of turbulence. That being said, if 30% is your max loss then sell and try again. If you get caught bag holding you‚Äôre going to hate yourself more than you might right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 08:54:00'] I‚Äôm in a similar situation with a few Jan 24 leaps. In some, I sold and rebought at a lower strike, others I‚Äôm planning to wait it out. MSFT is a strong company and I see a recovery over the next 2 years. I‚Äôd hold, but just me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 15:45:17'] I‚Äôm in the same boat with pypl, chwy, and others. There‚Äôs plenty of time. I‚Äôve lost a boatload of value the past 3-4 weeks but there is a ton of time left. No need to panic as painful as it is to see the red every day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 15:17:57'] What is a LEAP??
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 14:45:26'] This is what Leaps are about. The long long term. You‚Äôll be fine if you hold unless it‚Äôs all of your money. But I doubt anyone is stupid enough to throw everything they have into an options play
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 09:25:46'] Buy something to hedge a bear market that's shorter term?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 10:59:34'] Thanks for this post, I am in same boat and was contemplating panic selling as well despite the 2 year frame. Bought what was the dip during early jan and just annoyed I wasn‚Äôt more patient. After rationalizing, I agree with most of these comments and to hold if it‚Äôs solid stocks and not meme stocks. Msft has solid management and growth prospects.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 15:13:44'] LEAPs cost a lot because they have high Delta, and there is enough time to navigate periods of turmoil. I hold a bunch as well, and while they‚Äôve taken it hard, they will recover. This compression will end and the businesses will keep printing
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 15:46:31'] It depends...LEAPS, I wouldn't sell until around 40DTE, if it's still down then it's prolly not gonna bounce back. Take your tax write off at that point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 18:27:05'] I would have thought you have plenty of time to recover. With MSFT trying to expand into the Metaverse I think there‚Äôs a good chance the price will rise again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 19:50:58'] Buy some shorter term puts to cover your ass over the next 6 to eight weeks. The market is going to get whacked a couple times this year with rate increases. Be ready.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 01:23:22'] If you can‚Äôt wait it out then please give me the leap. I‚Äôll gladly take it off your hands.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 01:43:26'] I would sell OTM LEAP PUT. Usually I would trade as a combo at the outset but assuming I 'forgot' to put up the short leg, I would just do it now and since premiums have moved up with underlying down, it is in fact better.I would also continue selling the short dated CC. Next time, I would thought through the whole trade first precisely to prevent panicking while the roller coaster has already moved. cheerio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 02:18:56'] Double down and get out of half position  on next bounce . We should get good recovery in March and April
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 03:47:38'] Make it a calendar spread, sell some more near dated calls not as far otm. This will help mitigate the theta loos which will eat you up. I‚Äôd also roll into something like 2 years out so you can get the same priced calls, but back relative to where they were before the drawdown.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 03:54:16'] Sell on the rip Monday or Tuesday and wait for a 20%+ correction before buying. Likely to take another couple of months for the overall indexes to finish their correction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 05:56:17'] Double down
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 07:53:37'] Wait!!üòé
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 09:07:35'] MSFT is down approx. 10% from your $330 entry price, and 17% from all time high, so if another 20% haircut is in the cards from here, then it goes to $230...Sell a Back Ratio PUT March 18, 2022 ( Buy 1: $295 PUT & Sell 2 $230 puts, net Debit around $11 ...Continue Selling Calls  OTM or ITM You will have protection if things go way bad in the short term,  and buy time to assess how things will shake out with markets and Tech. Stocks post Earnings.You could also scale into a higher strike CALLS, maybe shorter duration LEAPS or 2022 Calls to cut your overall exposure, but still partake if it goes back up. IMHO
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 09:20:36'] It depends on how much of your portfolio is in that position. You have to make that calculation. If MSFT is still tanking in that time period I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre all going to be screwed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 12:43:11'] Indices will go down further by 5-8%. Your leaps could result in more loss BUT in 2 years time there is very high probability that you‚Äôll be in positive. I‚Äôd personally wait for MSFT to drop further and then buy some additional leaps to bring my overall cost down - while selling covered calls on existing leaps. I‚Äôd not try to time the market by selling my leaps now assuming your leaps are not a substantial part of your portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 12:03:08'] Refer to the plan you made before entering the trade including whatever risk tolerance you had for the trade. If you're not trading with a plan you're gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 12:19:42'] So tricky, both of stocks can move 8 - 10% in less than a week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 12:28:51'] I think the market will start to pick up in a week or two; the interest rate hike is still not going to have people pull money out of stock market into bonds‚Ä¶. Because the inflation is still high. I bought some NVDA and MSFT yesterday, so imo keep those calls for some more time and then make a decision
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 20:19:59'] The shift to value stocks will hurt these companies.  Inflation ain't going anywhere and interest rate hike will too.  There is also a mass-wide country protest for working conditions starting 1 May 2022 which, if legit, could cause some big time issues as well.It cost's an arm and a leg, but puts far out, like end of March somewhat near ATM should be a doosie.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 18:36:24'] Yeah you‚Äôre probably fine. Probably better to roll them out as they expire soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 20:53:24'] I close at 20% loss and call it a failed play. At least then I get 5 tries. Reenter to try again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 05:26:46'] I have the same expire and near the same strike for nvda. I'm holding nvda till earnings.  It's a stock that takes off, so I'm not too worried as I bought them betting they will kill it on earnings again. I don't have amd calls, but its just as explosive as nvda on news. Granted the drop in stimulus has a downside and also intrest rates going up. I'm just hoping the fed doesn't increase intrest by mid March or later.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 05:35:46'] You're good on the NVDA calls, 160 might be a bit much for AMD depending on your price but you should be good as they have earnings end of this month and the last 2 have been really good with this one expected to be as well
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 08:50:05'] Lucky.  I bought 100 shares at $325, so I've been slowly selling covered calls to cover the dip. :)

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-07 01:11:40'] Get out. Both NVIDIA & AMD has been great but the party is coming to an end. ETHs move from POW to POS represent a risk to GPU sales. Consider DWAC warrants, B90 Plc, and CFVI.

POST_TEXT: b"With the volatility and uncertainty of the economy and future FED policies, I've been thinking of pulling most of my positions while selling a put on QQQ and buying a leap as well.\n\nSince I'm selling a put on QQQ, I need the available funds (cash secured). Margin willing, I'd like to store that cash and give it upside potential while eliminating downside risk. That's where the married put came to mind, say buy 100 shares of something along the lines of NVDA, TSLA, or AMD shares and buying an ATM put far out (1-2 years) for each 100 shares (rolling covered calls also to help reduce premium for the put)\n\nBut I got to thinking, what advantage does that actually serve over just doing a call LEAP? \n\nI could buy the leap and store my cash in some low volatility dividend fund and still buy protective puts for much cheaper.\n\nSo, which is really better, the married put ( for this instance think 2 years) or the call LEAP?"
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-13 08:58:17'] Take a look at the P&L diagrams of:1. A LEAP call in NVDA - say January 20222. 100 shares of NVDA plus a married put in January 2022You will see they are effectively the same. Not a coincidence.If you are planning to sell covered calls, the shares can be a bit easier to manage.  Depending on your margin treatment, there can be advantages to the call vs. having the shares/married put.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-27 10:53:43'] IV literally tells you the current inflation of premiums on options. Low IV is a good buy signal for bullish stocksHigh IV is a great short signal for when you want to exploit people's greed and over optimism.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-27 23:30:26'] This is cool but in terms of strategy you generally want to be long vega on options that have low IV relative to HV, or if you're doing a calendar spread you could look at the IV slope.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-27 23:38:19'] This is legit, 45 day IV rank probably works best to find cheapest premiums Most likely interested in option prices 21days to 45 days out. Anything shorter is fd and probably every stock qualifies just on theta decay alone.

POST_TEXT: b'Been trading options for a few months now. Mostly just buy and sell calls/puts, nothing fancy. I want to start using spreads and had looked into these two strategies. My question is how does theta work different from PCS to the other or does it work the same in your favor. \nI often trade Spy, Nvda and Amd. Say if Im bullish on all three, which strategy is best to use? Thank you so much for your help\n\nMy expiration usually from three weeks to a month out'
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 09:01:07'] If the expiration and strikes are the same, a Put Credit Spread and a Call Debit Spread are synthetically equivalent.  The only advantage might be found if one has a narrower B-A spread and slightly better cost/credit as well as if directionally correct, one expires so no closing costs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 09:43:43'] Theta works against debit spreads but works for and helps credit spreads . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 09:51:30'] Theta decay is still relevant to a spread, but the narrower the spread width, the closer that theta nets to zero, limiting its impact on time value. So it usually isn't something you have to worry about unless your spread is unusually wide.In the case of a credit spread, you are still counting on theta decay reducing the buyback cost of your short leg, but at the same time, the value of your "insurance" long leg is also declining, so you don't get as much benefit from theta decay as you would with a naked short.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 09:02:11'] Debit spreads basically negate theta, so if ur bullish you can make more money on short term close to the money debit spreads. Put credit spreads will rely more on burning theta, so about a month out credit spreads close to the money will get the most bang for your buck since theta is relatively fat and burn is getting ready to ramp up in a big way.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-01 13:36:55'] Thank you all for your amazing replies and explanations @everyone üôè
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 14:43:58'] Theta is dependent on the IV of your short options.Some equities have call or put skew so one side may have higher IV than the other. That means you could get higher theta on one wide than the other.By the way, if you're playing long theta trades, avoid earnings contracts. Leading into earnings, theta does not make any money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 08:16:40'] In the money short calls are a commitment to sell stock for a loss, at less than your basis cost.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 09:02:58'] Your username looks like a call for help, do you need help, friend?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 17:45:38'] I don't think I would go any further past "make back my loss" as it suggests your risk appetite is inversely proportional to your PnL. This tends to be a recipe for trouble while trading, coming from experience. I would sell your NVDA and focus on the next thing you like.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 11:46:38'] When you sell a call, especially an ITM call, you should be prepared to sell the shares at the strike price. An ITM call will provide you with more downside protection, but you‚Äôre effectively selling your shares at the current stock price plus that one premium unless the call ends up OTM at expiration. You are more likely to retain the shares and be able to sell another call if you sell an OTM call. Regardless of your strike price, be prepared to sell your shares at whatever strike you pick or you may find yourself buying to close an option for (far) more than you sold it for.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:57:12'] sorry if i sound dumb, but if you buy high, is the smart thing to do is sell puts?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 09:13:45'] OP, just continue selling premium and earn that money. NVDA is great if you have a long term horizon.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 10:05:57'] That‚Äôs usually the move especially if you don‚Äôt think there will be a large enough price movement tomorrow. Idk I think a lot of investors will be looking for what NVDA says about the meta deal which if I‚Äôm not mistaken AMD has the advantage
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 10:54:34'] IV crush hurts long options and to overcome that, you need a larger move in the underlying.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 15:14:40'] Hope you took the profits today. NVDA is up 5% in after hours. What‚Äôs the reasoning behind buying puts on a chip stock during a chip shortage? They‚Äôre up almost 60% in the past 3 months. I wouldn‚Äôt bet against any chip stock until the shortage is over, but that‚Äôs just me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 10:27:54'] If you can, take some profits today and let some ride. If the stock tanks and the price move is large enough then IV crush won't be much of an issue.
