	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 09:59:56'] Legit question, how do I set up a camera that doesn‚Äôt have information sent to Amazon? Are there offline cameras that can be installed? I like ring and blink cause they transmit to my phone is there a way to get a camera that does this but won‚Äôt transfer my data to the company?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 13:26:35'] Make sure Alexa microphone is on all the time. This will help the Ring doorbell
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 13:36:10'] Everything connected to Wi-Fi is a security risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 14:38:24'] Are you telling me Amazon is using household products to spy on us? Hold on, let me ask my wire tap that always knows when I talk to it if this is true.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 16:45:58'] Funny thing is I had a friend who worked at Amazon when Alexa first became a thing, and talked about how people got paid to sit and listen to hours and hours of audio recorded from the device‚Ä¶. Ya know for science‚Ä¶.. and they said a huge portion of the audio was people just having sex üòÇ‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôd think someone spying on your doorbell is least of your worries ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:33:27'] If you use the app, it‚Äôs buried in the agreement they can look out of both of your cameras for an amount of time. They absolutely do this and mine the data.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 21:46:33'] And thus is why I refused to buy one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 06:44:36'] Such a BS fine. $30million is nothing to them. How about $10,000 per affected user.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 07:20:50'] I worked in telecom. Before smart phones someone at work told me they can listen and track when phone battery is ‚Äúdead‚Äù. Battery powers down but saves juice for gov tracking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 14:42:41'] Must be nice as a CEO to have people volunteer to quit prior to massive layoffs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:26:11'] I just saw 300 applications for a job that would have gotten 12-15 only 18 months ago.Now  is not when I‚Äôd be pushing buttons on leadership by threatening to walk out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:41:06'] Workers that want to stay home will drive to work and than walkout during their lunch break
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:54:20'] Those people that just got laid off will gladly take their spots. Now is not the time to lose your job.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 15:26:01'] Losing skilled and highly experience labor is more expensive for Amazon than hiring new ones - even if they pay new hires less, which will probably be the case. I think Amazon has more to lose than 1,000 employees doing a walkout.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 14:19:58'] Easy to figure out who they are going to fire in their next layoff.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 14:50:51'] Amazon doesn‚Äôt care. Prepare to be fired.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:16:23'] They might find out real quick how employment at will works.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 00:13:31'] When my company stayed remote after Covid died down we had people quit because they wanted to be in the office. Not every work environment is the right fit for everyone. If you don't like the company policy then, instead of protesting, just use that time to look for another job. This isn't Amazon discriminating or something like that. This is like protesting because they make you work on a PC instead of a Mac, or because you don't get a stand up desk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 04:00:08'] Acting like spoiled children
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:50:03'] if they walkout on lunch then they don't get their free catered lunches

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 22:22:28'] As shitty as it is, if they don‚Äôt want their staff to be full remote, this is the textbook way to do it (make it as much of a pain in the ass as possible to work remotely).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 13:15:53'] I wonder if corporate jobs can be replaced by a gig economy. Like could there just be an app that tells me there are some accounting documents that need to be signed, and I could just click that I will do it, drive to Amazon, sign some documents for $7+tip, and then go home until more documents need to be signed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:31:35'] This walkout is the biggest clown show ever! Let me drive my ass to office, work till noon, walk out, walk back in, work till evening and go home!  All the people who cried about not spending a $ at businesses around offices in protest of RTO will be making it rain for them during lunch hour. Strategic thinking here would be to make a reservation at a nice restaurant, walking out to grab a bite to eat, and going back to work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 13:13:41'] I doubt the corporate employees are going to get any sympathy from the warehouse workers working in literal cages with no air conditioning, timed bathroom breaks, and who get fired automatically by an algorithm via email.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:07:00'] I have family that works in Seattle Amazon offices. They complain about having to go back 2-3 days a week. They have a shuttle to drive them, they get free food, drinks every single day. They get lunches and after work food/drinks on the company dime.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 19:40:46'] The biggest warning sign with this company is that Michael Griffin, former head of NASA and a director on their board, sold his entire stake in the company back in December. It was 1.8M shares so not a small amount. It's entirely possible he is the biggest moron ever. He wasn't one of NASA's best administrators. It seems more likely though, that he knows this company is going nowhere and he wanted to cash out before the share price drops any further. I wish you luck though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:00:17'] Caught that slip too. But it's also been the worst kept secret in space for months now, so I don't know what they thought they were gaining by not announcing it. The fact that Kuiper (a mega constellation) is going to need a new factory worth of reaction wheels isn't surprising. I guess there is no better place to announce it than the biggest space conference.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:11:36'] How does this help the SP? They've already announced the deal and the fact that thousands of reaction wheels will be sold as part of that. That revenue should be priced in. The specific partner involved doesn't seem like it should matter all that much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 23:56:38'] I‚Äôm expecting growth stocks to all reprice to the downside with the imminent recession, which would lead to a better opportunity to buy leap calls on the rocketlab. As the market corrects 5-10%. Growth should drop +30%. Rocketlab would be $2.5-$3.That would be the best risk to reward opportunity.Since we don‚Äôt know when the announcement will be and there are storm clouds on the horizon for the growth industry with interest rate headwinds, it‚Äôs not best to buy call options right now. Shares would be safe but the opportunity cost associated with them are not appealing enough for me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 06:35:47'] This doesn't add up. Project Kuiper is a ~10 billion dollar project from Google, and just looking at how much reaction wheels cost as a % of a satellite, it's about 1-2% of the total weight of the sat. SpaceXs sats are like 10-100k each, and even if they were a million Rocketlab isn't getting a billion dollars from Kuiper, which as you pointed correct wants ~3k sats in total. It sounds like this is a good deal for rocketlab, but you're wrong on how big of an idea it is

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-18 18:06:49'] Great news for all Amazon employees.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-18 09:20:58'] This is twofold.  #1 An attempt to cull people who moved away, but still exist in their HR system as being tied to a metro/office location and thus don't want to come back.  #2. It could also be an attempt to reclassify people in their HR system as fully remote and thus pay them less but I'm not sure if Amazon pays remote less than those tied to an office in their HR system.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-18 11:45:55'] I seriously think this is all a ploy to fabricate value for their major corporate RE stakes. All companies are going to try this now with the power back in the hands of the employers due to the job market. WFH is a totally viable long term solution that actually makes sense for companies‚Äô profit margins as well. Why don‚Äôt they just cut their losses on the millions, if not billions, of dollars of real estate they have? Well, they certainly can‚Äôt offload that to anyone. Who the hell is buying or leasing expensive office RE right now? Why would you with how much sense WFH makes. They just need to keep the value propped up long enough to get tf out or coordinate an effort to make RTO happen so that corporate RE sees ‚Äúvalue‚Äù again. We‚Äôre all gonna do the same shit in the office that we do WFH anyways‚Ä¶ collaboration my ass. I‚Äôm just gonna instant message my coworkers the same way I already do. I mean seriously, more than half the people I work with live in different states and countries. Now I‚Äôm just gonna have to haul my sorry ass to an uncomfortable office everyday for no reason and waste company time commuting. It‚Äôs so stupid, and there is literally no logic tied to it.

No one bat an eye then. Now they want us back in the office which costs me 2,5 hours a day in transit. Been in the office every now and then lately and it does not increase my productivity at all. On the contrary, all the office talk and people disturbing me with their private life stories and problems only works counterproductive. It's the typical old mentality of CEO's who think that the office is some sort of magical place. It should be optional so that the extraverts who need this kind of social interaction can still go, but leave the introverts to themselves. In my job they can easily measure my productivity through my weekly timesheets so there is no excuse to doubt my work ethic working from home...

Why not just get a job like that instead of complaining now ?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 05:30:26'] Definitely a de facto layoff, but the part of this that most people don't discuss is that many people aren't able to work from home effectively.  Some people just aren't self-starters and need the office environment and direct accountability to be a good worker. In addition to the people that simply aren't wired to work without the office environment, there's also a part of the population that abuses the system and fucks around all day, lies about missing deadlines, and will literally pretend to be working while randomly going on day trips and shit.  Sure, the companies are shitty for trying to force everyone back in.  You'll get no argument from me there.  For some people though, they have no choice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 17:52:14'] I am so thankful my company closed 5 offices and went to cube sharing. We go in once-every other week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:26:28'] Amazon should stick to being Wal-Mart with a datacenter/web services (AWS) business unit.  They aren‚Äôt a brick and mortar grocer or an aerospace company. I bought their stock with the hope they‚Äôd increase their earnings by narrowing their scope.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:20:06'] Amazon has an incentive to invest in markets where it knows it can‚Äôt win to keep its competitors guessing. The goal with this type of marketing strategy is to get competitors to waste their resources investing and competing in markets where Amazon intends to exit early. It‚Äôs sort of like a multi-million dollar game of chicken.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:29:42'] in wonder what they think was wrong with it versus the fact that it was a completely inaccessible to curious consumers being the actual thing that was wrong with it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 20:31:24'] This is nothing id even factor into anything. Amazon is not priced as having a really good shot of taking over most of our grocery store business. It's priced at a growing online gloglabment. Tesla would be an example of something that's priced at promises that are falling through not Amazon. but he didn't open any Tesla solar construction plants. Thus no news of them closing

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 23:04:13'] I used to work at one of these stores and they have still yet to break even on the profit margins with them. I assume if they build more and keep at it they‚Äôll eventually get more recognition. But the payment system is fucked for them. You can scan in with an Amazon account that has a credit card that has a negative balance and take literally anything you want and won‚Äôt be charged until 30 minutes after you‚Äôve left the store. They have 300 dollar bottles of wine in there and people got really privy to this and started stealing like fucking crazy. One guy started just making different Amazon accounts and got like 30k worth of shit over several months using masks during Covid. idk if he ever got caught.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 23:30:48'] It‚Äôs weird how folks think these places were overran with theft. You couldn‚Äôt just walk into these and I‚Äôm pretty sure Amazon would deny you, with evidence from their many cameras, access to their products.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 07:39:28'] The only "retail" store they should have thought about is small stores with just a couple of workers where people can pick up their items or return items. Cut out all the middlemen they use for lockers or returns. It would be a place safe from porch pirates and better for items that don't fit in lockers, like big screen TVs or furniture. Could even have refrigerators so people can pick up their Amazon Fresh orders there. They could even sell snacks and such that you buy online then go pick up your bag of snacks there. Keep the store online, make the pick ups and returns in person. Low overhead and low staffing needs and fills a gap in their business practice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 09:41:03'] I refuse to use any kind of self checkout until there is an incentive to do so like 10% off. Basically we need these jobs for people instead of maximizing profits by having my and my wife's boyfriend pay and bag our own groceries.... also we don't need the Wendy's dumpster zones over populated as that creates competition and price wars cuz those margins are already too thin...

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:17:28'] Why tho? Amazon was made for WFH. Jassy is a numbnuts. They should be setting the trend to encourage remote work because people at home are buying shit online, not stopping at the store on the way home for errands, have more discretionary income, and need cloud services to work.Puts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:25:51'] As a fully regard gentlemen, I left a relatively high paying real estate development job for much lower paying job in manufacturing, where I work from home. My work is much better, I‚Äôm much less stressed and this company never would of gotten me if they didn‚Äôt offer this position remote. The talent pool grows when you offer remote and you can offer less money because they are comfortable and it‚Äôs a benefit. Everyone is happier this way in my eyes. The whole thing is you have to hire professionals you don‚Äôt have to babysit.

Now your neighborhood that used to be affordable based on your local wage structure has some 6+ figure tech dolt buying up the neighborhood to rent to the peasants. Remote workers should get their wage rates set to appropriate levels to where they are remote working from, not to exceed the local office wages. You would instantly see remote workers flock back after they realize they can no longer be king of the dirt people  of butt-fuck Egypt.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 21:47:25'] I wrote $1000 worth of 104 puts last Tuesday and was hoping we would rally. Honestly glad for the pull back. But part of me wishes I just bought shares. Could‚Äôve sold AH for like $7000 gain. I‚Äôm hoping it goes sideways tomorrow. I think it‚Äôs time to start wheeling AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 04:32:47'] AWS computation pricing is so high that it forces heavy users to build their own cloud services. If Amazon reduced the price curve, from exponential to linear, it would retain far more customers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:14:48'] Dutch: *laugh in V.OC.*Amazon and Bezos aren't even remotely close to being the first publicly traded company to lose a trillion. Maybe in 'market value' on the modern stock exchange, but he's a little peanut.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 17:37:34'] Amazon has become a place were you buy items at a market value price and when you receive the item it's a knockoff of the original you wanted to buy. There's no fixing that fundamental problem. They get too many counterfeit merchandise and they don't have the man power to check every single item that comes to their warehouses. That's why I'd rather go out and get whatever it is I need within an hour than to wait for a delivery from them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:25:39'] Their only money maker these days is Amazon Web Services. I find things cheaper at Target, Walmart, and Publix all the time now, and who the fuck cares about "1 day shipping", when I can just grab the shit I want off the shelf myself. Oh, and don't get me started on them pissing away 1 billion dollars on that shitty Rings of Power bullshit!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 23:12:54'] No Amazon will not crash. Believe it or not there is still a mathematical basis for market movement. Amazon is a great innovative tech company with great numbers and huge opportunities to even further increase efficiency. It might drop with the overall market for a year or so but it won‚Äôt crash barring an executive scandal or something like that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 06:50:54'] Makes sense- the shift to Air freight was a natural consequence during the pandemic of a couple factors:1. Backlogged Shipping Ports 2. Reduced commercial aviation 3. Low fuel costs 4. Increased demand for consumer goods relative to servicesThese trends have all reversed so you would expect to see a freight Air carrier like Amazon that invested in capacity during the pandemic to see excess capacity now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 04:40:05'] This is bad news for Amazon. Excess capacity on its cargo planes means that the company will have to sell this space at a discount, which will eat into its profits. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 08:14:10'] UPS and FedEx have been doing for years. It‚Äôs a smart move by Amazon to contract out their planes. While it‚Äôs still part of Amazon it needs to be managed as a Air Cargo carrier not as part of Amazon.

They had to build up the capacity specifically to handle the Prime Day and XMAS loading only to find that by February they had WAY too much capacity. So they started to lease that capacity with this AWS setup. Now that is a major revenue stream as well as a "moat" in Buffett terms. Google, Microsoft et al followed suit.  As usual the analysts were short sighted and unable to see the risk/reward. Those who can do; those who can't work on Wall Street and fake it until they make it.

Caught in a tough spot, they had to grow for the COVID demand and built out their supply chain network to 2025 levels. Now they have to cut back with the decline in demand and inflationary pressure.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 23:28:30'] >This is interesting news. It seems that Amazon is trying to control its costs by clamping down on hiring. This makes sense, given the slowdown in sales growth that the company has been experiencing. I'm curious to see how this will impact AWS's ability to compete in the cloud market going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 10:50:14'] In regards to Meta, cutting people and hurting future growth of ideas was bullish. After all, firing people and instilling fear is very bullish for companies. If you cut 99% of workers, your stock will go up a lot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 03:11:08'] Ok but why?? Apple is the most fragile... While they're great at doing business, the success is only based on morons buying into their marketing. If Apple disappeared today, not much would change in the world, if Google disappeared, it would take years to but a similarly good search engine, and what about maps? Even Gmail is not so easy to replace with a tool as effective...of Amazon disappeared, shopping will immediately become harder (which might be a good though) and our lives be impacted white bit...Apple and Tesla are the 2 most overrated stocks, I can't believe people still buy those,only thing keeping up the value is marketing and people's stupidity (which I admit is a very strong and aboundant "resource" in the world)... As soon as the trends change and they become uncool, they will collapse...

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 04:25:35'] Which should really show you that apple will eat a massive bag of dicks at some point. There is almost nothing left for them to increase as far as market growth. They have what Amazon has in the cloud computing space. No where to go and everything to lose to competition. Apple is being forced to switch to USB C and that's going to cut massively into accessories sales. The iPhone this year was lackluster and we are in a recession/heading to one. I can definitely see a future in the next 1 or 2 earnings where they lose 30% immediately as everyone who's loaded into that company tries to cash out at the top. The biggest player I'd watch to see if there is any issue is warren Buffett. That dudes portfolio is now unbelievably heavy in apple. If you start to see reports that say Warren Buffett is rebalancing his portfolio so no need to worry about him offloading millions of shares, that's the time to start buying puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 05:28:35'] I love Apple and don‚Äôt understand how companies even allow people to have email an a non-apple device due to privacy and security issues. That said, there is no way Apple is worth more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta. And I say that believing the latter three are overvalued. But here is the thing‚Ä¶ Apple had great hardware and software, but their main competitive edge is how they organized their supply chain. Unfortunately the world has decided to turn into a protectionist hell so this main advantage will sadly disappear or at the very least need to be reconfigured. People are still paying premium price for an advantage that is a disadvantage in the new world order that is being shaped as we speak. I‚Äôm rooting for Apple and globalization, and to support them I have a few puts outstanding to inverse myself.

Google on the other hand is loosing ad revenue and their other products such as the phones and other hardware products don't seem to be doing well in terms of sale. Amazon is feeling the hit of inflation with consumer spending dropping because of increased cost of goods. Apple is the only one that is doing well as they their products have done well over the past few month especially with the release of the M2 chip in their new Macbooks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 01:21:20'] True, but sadly most bubbles require years to pop. And sometimes they do not pop, they just fade. The popping of the AI bubble will not make us money, like the real-estate bubble did for those who shorted it in 2007-2008.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 01:06:13'] This is an interesting data point. It seems that the companies who are mentioning artificial intelligence the most are also the ones who are seeing the greatest success in terms of their stock prices and overall business performance. This could be because they are investing heavily in AI and reaping the benefits, or it could simply be a coincidence. Either way, it's clear that AI is becoming increasingly important to businesses all over the world and those who aren't paying attention may find themselves falling behind soon enough.

Why pay Five Tech Workers 100k when you can pay 1 Tech worker 250k to do the jobs of five Tech workers with AI.

The idea with blinders is that AI will increase productivity exponentially, with no downside!  It'll figure out how to make every single part of production extremely efficient.  Then it will take over production completely.  Obviously this is a big economic boon right?  If you run a company or have tons of investments, great!  But what about all the current workers?   They will quickly be out of the job within a few years of that.  Then there will be a severe lack of people who can pay mortgage, car payment, or buy any consumer goods at all.   What then?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 08:28:33'] The companies mentioning AI the most have real uses for AI, and are anticipating an enormous amount of value to come from its implementation over the coming years. When you calculate the potential for AI to generate income from marketing, analytics, taking over people‚Äôs jobs (lots of jobs would gradually be taken over by various AI tools), autonomous vehicles/equipment, etc, you would come to realize that we‚Äôre barely scratching the surface. Expected growth in companies smartly reaping the benefits of AI is significant.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 08:33:34'] the value of true AI is thousands of trillions of dollars. Of course everyone is eager to show progress toward that monetary explosion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 08:34:21'] I really wish we could be using punctuation like A.I. instead AI. For my stupid eyes, it appears the articles or memes are about Al  as in Al Bundy or Al Borland. It's not always super clear that it's AI. On the other hand, it's funny to pretend that millions of people around the world are beginning to source Al Bundy for improved methods and that many sre questioning if we have gone too far or that it's too late to turn back with Al Bundy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 08:36:39'] It's not a bubble, it's just a rebranding. The world has ran on algorithms for years, now it's just moving more towards machine learning for better predictions and is being called AI.Try imagining any business not trying to anticipate their customers, it just doesn't work anymore. Netflix will have their bot try and guess what shitty romcom you want to watch next, Amazon will try and sell you another piece of useless plastic, every website will try to figure out what keywords they can cram into either the header or search keywords to drive in views.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 09:51:03'] I would love to see this graph run for non-tech companies. I bet you'd be surprised how many mentions AI is getting from non-tech these days.

I have valued the company (I write this down from memory so mby its not accurate) on 5,4$ and the 4Q22 I valued it on 0,5$ and in 3Q 4,8$. I did a lynch formula also incase I did something wrong. The Thing I dont understand that when it was valued on 4,8$ it went down like 15% that day and today it went 5% down on 5,4$ but when it was on 0.5$ it went up (all the valuations was calculated day before the financial statement). So can someone explain me why when the stock is in bad position and is under expectations why does the stock go up but when is it over expectations (1Q23 is 80% over expectations) it goes down like are the people just dumb or am I missing something? Thanks for your answer.'

First, it could be that the market was overreacting to the bad news in the 1Q23 financial statement and selling off the stock too much. Alternatively, it's possible that investors were already pricing in a lot of bad news for Amazon, so when the actual results came out they weren't as bad as expected and the stock went up. Finally, it could also be that there is some underlying negative sentiment towards Amazon right now (perhaps due to concerns about its business model or competitive position) which is causing the stock to underperform even when it reports good news.

Major loss for charities that counted on this money. Amazon Will likely replace with a program that has a much smaller impact for a few designated charities of their choice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:42:52'] People don‚Äôt understand how incredibly expensive 30x sales is. If the company had no costs, paid no salaries, issued no stock comp, and returned all of its revenues to shareholders, it would take 30 years to pay you back‚Ä¶ you can assume growth of course but that‚Äôs A LOT of ground to make up.In comparison, the 30 year is paying you 4% per year.Take a look at the long time chart of CSCO.Cisco has a negative annualized return going back to April of 2000. 23 years and the return is still NEGATIVE. This is with dividends reinvested.It‚Äôs far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2000&firstMonth=4&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=CSCO&allocation1_1=100
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:45:30'] Yes. I work in AI, I use cuda, I've bought Nvidia cards for 20 years.But I sold all my stock a month ago. When things come crashing down because LLMs don't replace everyone's job, then maybe I'll buy in again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:26:27'] The stock went up 27% after hours during the earnings call. That‚Äôs like taking 3-5 years worth of accelerated profits into account. I sold at 385. This is a general public stock now, it‚Äôs current upside is limited. Especially when you consider the market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:07:02'] investors dont give a shit about sales today, they look to the future, when AI becomes more prevalent there will be an even greater increase in demand for their data centers/products, they are already seeing a surge in demand for them especially from huge companies, their revenue for that alone is over 4 billion and was the reason why their quarterly revenue was higher, future looks promising nvidia

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:54:20'] Yet analyst have 12 month targets for 450-500. Lmao.AI is real but unfortunately there is way too much hype. It's trading at 2027 prices if it can grow revenue 30-40% yearly. I highly doubt it will be able to continue to do that. Maybe one or two years max
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:53:12'] I believe it's very overpriced. But if people keep buying millions of $ in OTM puts, it will surely keep going up
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:29:52'] The key difference is Grace Hopper.No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. Should it be this way? No.Does it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison.

The application is tough because it‚Äôs a language model. Spent a lot of time on mushrooms discussing this with some other that are near the industry. Language was on topic that kept coming up along with the fact we have no idea how much computing power ai could take. Everyone thought bitcoin mining took a lot of work, now considered ai that is running thousands of computations to come up with the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. It‚Äôs gonna be a mess for a while and may never reach its full potential cause it‚Äôs based on humans and our language

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:26:52'] Well using a perpetual dividend model to make an equivalent company: Nvidia has a cost of equity about 9.55%. I am going to say this theoretical company is going to have a dividend growth of 8% per year for perpetuity, then NVDA is currently priced equivalent to a company that returns a $6.5 annual dividend that grows 8% FOREVER. This is absurd, the price will definitely come down or their cost of equity will skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:43:02'] Nvidia has been riding on the crypto boom since 2016.  The market did crash in 2017 and Nvidia coasted on their RTX 20 series which weren't well received.  Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:13:42'] It‚Äôs not over, priced only because demand forward growth potential, long-term growth, supply and demand order contracts‚Ä¶ Dot anywhere purchase between 317 and 417 is a great purchase for the next 3 to 8 years
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:51:55'] Let me put some perspective. If Nvidia has revenue of 100bn (will have to more than double) with a profit margin of 40% (will have to increase from 30%) they will generate 40 bn in profit and multiply that by 25 will give you 1 trillion marketcap. So basically its overvalued. A lot of future is priced in for perfection. I would suggest short it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:27:57'] It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that Tesla was trading @ $1200 + a share how would it be crazy to think a company based on technology that could replace millions of jobs be in the same ballpark. The main question is your cost average at an overbought level to maximize ROI

GPU‚Äôs are important for AI but they aren‚Äôt going to be the money driver it will be the products other companies develop. Also most likely the big AI company hasn‚Äôt been started yet, but the future owner probably just got fired from his tech job.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:50:08'] It's overvalued but not grossly. Look at its forward data. Forward PE 40. Could definitely do with say a 20% correction but they could just as easily grow another 10% together with a 10% correction instead. Plus it has hype status.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:54:48'] What if AI never really takes off? Sure it will be around but won‚Äôt be as big as the speculation seems to be. Lots of things can go wrong, for starters AI tools can be prone to errors, also regulations in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:11:56'] Delisting means they stop selling which means the stock will go up in value because they stop making them

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:10:40'] Delisting doesn‚Äôt mean u can‚Äôt trade it after. It moves to OTC. A lot of OTC stocks have performed better after moving off major exchange. (See Luckin Coffee). I have no position, just providing info.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:18:25'] Wow, I hadn't really thought about that, but I guess you can't just hold your short position and get paid off after delisting, so you'd have to close it.  That means getting delisted is a guaranteed short term bounce for anything, haha.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 05:28:58'] SEC created "expert markets" to lockout regular people form trading the stock. So yes, it does stop getting traded. The only people that can trade it in the "expert markets" are large institutions. Everyone else is locked out. Also keep in mind that BBBY has a corrupt board that is destroying this business and profiting from its destruction. This is an engineered demolition. **If there was any justice, the board would be investigated and prosecuted for conflicts of interest and misleading investors.**

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 12:16:28'] I think that this layoff is a bit different than the meta one.  Amazon employees like 1.5M people.  10k of that is a drop of piss in a bucket.  Having said that I'm rooting for you.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 14:44:38'] Market is also regarded. Meta announced layoffs on a Tuesday. When they announced the number Thursday the stock jumped. Same may happen with Amazon but I hate when the market does the opposite of what‚Äôs likely to be an increase. I almost bought 10 shares today and I may still tomorrow
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 15:13:13'] ... unless the broader market drops.  Since we are in a bear market still it's likely that the market will continue to move as a group.Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 14:30:45'] Amazon is by far the most expensive of the FAANG stocks. Also it's probably one of the most affected by slowdowns and consumer discretionary spending.This is WSB so I expect nothing less than idiocy. I'm shorting snowflake and QQQ.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 13:54:05'] In 08 that was the common theme: layoffs = stock bumpWith that in mind I'll genuinely not be surprised if the opposite happens this go around just cuz all of retail who was paying attention in 08 is predicting the same behavior.Perhaps the lay offs at amazon signal that it is done growing as a company or that future growth is going to be much slower.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 15:20:22'] Consumer sentiment is very low (54.7) and you buy calls on a consumer discretionary company that is probably going to see a much worse holiday season than last year and you do it in a Roth account where you cannot realize the tax loss?  I admire your conviction but I'm not sure the force is with you on this one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 15:51:59'] Um. Buddy I just bought in in the low 90s and I'm fuckin worried. JeezEdit : awwww not your Roth. Fuck. Me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 16:34:27'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 16:39:03'] Agreed. But why 12/9 options when monthly 12/16s are so much more liquid and the spread is a lot better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 10:18:38'] This doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Layoffs mean they have less money and they have less resources to expand. Which I think would normally decrease a stock. Why is it this case?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 17:12:57'] 10,000 jobs means nothing ‚Ä¶. They had 1.6 million employees last year.  They could have a hiring freeze and lose more then that

If ADBE can get just a fresh 10% of this sub to start posting ‚Äúgain‚Äù porn, that equates to almost 1,400,000 new customers. All in calls.

Some stonks even play games with this so ever other time the future looks amazing and the price goes way up. ADBE has everything we want and no sketchy ups and downs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:57:49'] Excellent point about buying hard assets and not software. Having physically tangible things is a good place to store your value. However, I don‚Äôt think the demand for electric vehicles is as much as people think it is. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs trying to buy a 75K vehicle when a lot of combined avg incomes in numerous states is anywhere from 65-85K. Anyone who wants to debt max themselves on a vehicle that costs the same as an entire years salary gets what they deserve.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:32:00'] They‚Äôre going to beat production and delivery estimates for the quarter, but miss on EPS because expenses are higher than planned. Would not be surprised to see them revise guidance for deliveries up from the 50k previously announced. Overall:-	RJ is the smartest CEO in the vehicle manufacturing space. Go listen to the ‚ÄúHow I Built This‚Äù podcast to get a sense for his journey to get to where he‚Äôs at. This is the #1 reason I‚Äôm bullish on them. Their first ever vehicle won countless accolades and awards and safety top picks. RJ gets a lot of credit for that, but he doesn‚Äôt crave the attention. He just gets shit done quietly. Dude has his PhD from MIT‚Äôs Auto Design division, and he did it because he knew he‚Äôd need credibility with investors to start a car company. -	They don‚Äôt currently have any real competition. They‚Äôre the only three row electric SUV on the market. Truck is after a different market than the F-150. Yes, competition is coming but Rivian just set the bar astronomically high.-	Rivian has done very little / none demand gen marketing. It‚Äôs all been brand building. They‚Äôre not going to Tesla charging stations and offering test drives. (Ahem‚Ä¶. LCID) Their book of orders and order volume is solid at the moment. They don‚Äôt even have a referral program. Everyone else seems to be scrambling to drive orders.-	They will eat Subarus lunch. All Subaru had to do was launch an electrified Forester/Outback/Ascent. Instead, we got the abomination that is the solterra. And they‚Äôve not really announced other plans. The R2 line (coming 2025/2026) will be lower priced and squarely targeted at the Crosstrek/Forester Market, presenting the first real competition the Model Y has had. -	their costs have been astronomical because they ramped three vehicles to production simultaneously. Doing just one (model 3) nearly bankrupted Tesla. Rivian‚Äôs now sitting on a fantastic foundation, has hella runway, and fantastic vehicles, all without a CEO who is constantly whining and drawing attention to himself in the public sphere.-	I‚Äôm not seeing anywhere that suggests RJ has sold most of his stock. He bought another 40,000 shares in March of 2022 and Insiders aren‚Äôt buying a ton more, but I can‚Äôt find anything about them selling their shares. Sauce?Positions: I‚Äôm holding a small bag by comparison to most highly regarded traders, but a bag nonetheless. (450 shares + an R1T)TL;DR - buy high sell low

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:48:06'] Lol‚Ä¶Rivian sold 20,000 cars in the past year and has the same market cap as Nissan which sold 3.2M cars during the same period. Using Tesla as a comparison metric is ludicrous because Tesla is also enormously overvalued. They got away with it for years because anything ‚Äútech‚Äù related got a pass on normal financial metrics, but that‚Äôs not the case anymore. I‚Äôve driven a Rivian, they are nice vehicles but they are really expensive for what you get and with every other established automaker now ploughing billions into EVs, they are going to have a really hard time being anything other than a niche car maker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 04:58:43'] I mean it‚Äôs still a 13 billion market cap and most people on this earth have never seen a Rivian car with their own eyes. I don‚Äôt wish ill-will on your trade, but I wouldn‚Äôt feel overly confident it has hit bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:57:33'] Have you considered that it takes probably 500-1M EV sales before you start making money on EVs?  Rivian is sooooo far away from making money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:46:13'] Not trying to dump on your thesis, but most car companies are trading below 5x pe right now with the obvious exception of tsla. And at a valuation of only 1/4 that of a company like GM or F (who sell over 2 million cars a year), it actually looks incredibly overvalued to me. Even at max capacity, that's like 1/15 of the deliveries of a legacy automaker at 1/4 of the stock price. Not a value play at all. If you believe it's a growth story, then have at it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:03:22'] My cost basis is around 20. I should sell, but I enjoy being reminded how regarded I am. Rivian has a big problem. It's cars are too expensive coming into a fed induced slowdown in the economy. Yes, they make a great vehicle ... but a great product does not always make a company successful. Since I suck at picking individual stocks, this is a strong reason to sell RIVN. My current pessimism is also a strong buy signal though. Hmmm

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:20:14'] Rivian can make the best cars in the world, they‚Äôre still losing money on every vehicle sold. They may have gotten by for years before the fed raised rates, but with interest at the rates they are now the company is quite unsustainable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:45:00'] I think the bigger issue w/ RIVN is how poorly they manage expectations. Their forward guidance never lines up with what is realistic. It's yes-men all the way up, which backfires on them when they miss their deadlines for their forward guidance. Also, cost of goods sold has be 3x their revenue the last three quarters. They have a seriously long road to profitability. They also have negative free cash flow.At the current rate, they have maybe 15 to 16 more months before they have to consider borrowing money a substantial amount of money. I really like RIVN, I'm hoping they find a way to be reduce their cost of goods sold, but I just don't see how they're going to do that without borrowing a ton of money. I don't know if the issue is because they're selling these vehicles at a lost or if it's an issue with scaling on the manufacturing side, but at the moment, their saving grace seems to likely be getting acquired by another company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:06:43'] They do make nice cars, maybe too nice, when they should be trying to make money instead.  There isn't enough market for the high end EVs unless they are actually hugely profitable, which they aren't yet.Tesla has already beat them to the game, and others like Ford and Cadillac have to sell at a loss to try to get any market share.RIVN is eventually doomed, they needed to corner that delivery van market before others got in and it's too late now.  They will just bleed money before getting sold off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:59:40'] Net Assets - You did not factor in the Q1 loss yetGreat Cars - Correct, but they lose money making them... might be an issue you overlookedAs you astutely noted they will need to raise cash... Not a good look.As to multiples of sales or equity... Interesting... But plenty of investors are trying to value these based on profits or future profits and multiple of sales is one of the less relevant measures here. Multiple of equity tells you how positive people view the company at. Obviously for RIVN they don't view it very positively at all.

And the valuation will follow.Rivian burn rate is truly insane. Tesla never had such a burn rate. I do like the cars they are making but the problem is they are just super wasteful and just bad at doing business. They should cut costs and by a lot. They should be much much better at designing good factories and efficient manufacturing processes - but they are just not good at this at all!I don't know, maybe they will manage to get their shit together but at the moment I don't see any signs pointing to that outcome.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:48:37'] In the current high-interest environment, Rivian is DOA. Having average efficiency of 2mi/kw on top of an outdated 400v architecture, means your $80-$90k truck will be outdated by the next year. Once Ram, Chevy, and Ford start to mass produce 400+ mile trucks that charge at 350kw, Rivian won‚Äôt be able to compete. They just don‚Äôt have Tesla‚Äôs battery technology and production edge, thus, they are just like any other car manufacturer out there.

As a test engineer at a rival electric company that dismantles these things, you are wrong about your assumptions. Production quality will catch up with them QUICK. The reason they probably have so much cash on hand is because they are waiting for the wave of broken 1st gen vehicles to hit. Tesla had over 50% failure rate for their vehicles and that was during an advantageous time for a company to grow and get money from local government and sustain this rate of failures. I do not see how rivian could possibly be in that position moving forward. Also the prices are fucking stupid. Who‚Äôs paying 100k for an electric truck? Not normal people who might need to sell it for the next vehicle. Electric vehicle secondary market is a disaster and rivians are no exception.

Their electric vehicle is the most inefficient and poorest performing EV on the market, and their reliability isn‚Äôt any better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:04:42'] For a company that spent $7b I see 1 Rivian a month if that and I live in Tampa in a decent HCOL. I also think they're ugly as shit. The amount of cars they actually produced in comparison to the money they're burning, it's a disaster. Your thesis is misjudged. You're considering them "undervalued" now because they were grossly overvalued at IPO. Polestar opened a dealership here and has actually been getting a lot of traction. Not to say they're any better as I haven't looked into EVs due to the pricing and inconvenience, but I've seen a lot more of them around.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:09:21'] The problem with the net asset theory is that, sure a car company has a lot of tangible things. Lets see what we have in that category:-Current Assets:Cash,Account Receivables,Petty Cash Finds,Prepaid insurance,Allowance for Doubtful Accounts,Inventory,-Fixed assets:Buildings,Vehicle,Land,Accumulated Depreciation of, Equipment‚Äôs Buildings and VehiclesSo cash is great of course. But inventory (the trucks they make) doesn't mean shit if you go out of business. People are wary of buying from a non-existent company. Building, land and vehicles get sold off at a discount and you can't sell them early to raise funds. You can borrow against them but in a high rate environment it's not gonna be good.All that being said I have no position, so good luck I hope you hit it big.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:10:10'] Yeah to add to the anecdotes, I've seen tons of new Rivians near me. Neighbor just got one and absolutely loves it. My last ICE was a BMW M6, and I've owned exclusively electrics since 2018 (on my second Tesla), would never go back to gas. Electrics are better in 95% of use cases, not to mention much much cheaper to own. Virtually no maintenance other than tires. Much more fun to drive, much faster acceleration. A Rivian pickup truck would absolutely dust most Audi sports cars off the line, which is a hilarious concept but true... Compare it to an Audi R8, their fastest car (which STARTS at $161k, more than twice the cost of a Rivian). The Rivian truck is still faster 0-60 than a $161k R8.The bad news: I'm also long Rivian and long Tesla, so they're almost sure to drop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:11:16']  `Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles.` Rivian will not be able to outprice Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Tesla, Toyota, Nissan etc. At best Rivian will be 5% of the market, probably sticking to the "luxury EV" niche it seems to be targeting.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:13:26'] Holy shit Rivian is gonna go bankrupt now. Gj.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:13:55'] I'm not reading this blog but I do have a question that I'm not sure was answered here or not.Does Rivian qualify for the EV tax credit? I thought they were too expensive to be qualified, and if so, I think that's a big reason why Rivian will continue to lose market share, and eventually be bought out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:22:32'] Lol : ‚Äúonly 13b$‚Äù.Tesla IPOed at 1b$ and stayed in the 5b$ range for years. And Tesla was probably the exception; not the norm. Most car companies fail‚Ä¶ the last one to succeed before Tesla was Chrysler. I wish you luck. It‚Äôs possible rivian survives and thrives but the odds are aren‚Äôt in its favor. It would need a miracle. Ask chatpgt to give you the list of defunct car companies‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a long list. And 13b$ is still highly valued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:25:43'] > _"Its existing factory can produce 150k vehicles per year, at $75k per vehicle, that will generate $11b of revenue!"_Stopped reading here. Just because they _can_ produce these vehicles does not mean that they can sell them. Banks are staying away from them, and regular trucks are overpriced and not selling right now. You know what that means, right? We're about to get a whole lot of leftover stock in the ICE truck market, which means that their price will dramatically fall and people will buy those instead.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:26:06'] The EV market is a battle between old brands making new cars and new brands making their first cars. I‚Äôm more in the former camp than the latter. The capital intensiveness of building a brand new auto manufacturing operation is just so massive and the time to build a legitimate brand is so long. Tesla benefited by being the first and only major EV company but you cant expect the same level of brand coverage for Rivian/Lucid now. Still money to be made trading but overall I‚Äôd be playing volatility and not expecting some major glow-up for this one specific EV maker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:28:41'] >billions in hard assets, not intangible softwareThis is an argument against your thesis. If a SAAS product gains traction, you could see a million new paid users in a month. The incremental cost of each new customer acquisition is trivial.If a million people want your truck, you have to build a million trucks to realize the potential revenue. Even with economies of scale, your per-unit costs will have a pretty high floor.Yes, tangible assets can be sold off if the company collapses, but they also depreciate, and bankruptcy sales tend to involve fire sale price levels.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:41:21'] I don‚Äôt have hard numbers on the ratios of vehicles that have broken down under 2000 miles, but the amount of posts/videos of people with dead Rivens makes me question the QA practices of the company. If they are prioritizing delivery over quality/repairs, it makes me want to stay far far away from this company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:46:11'] I know Rivian owners and they love it. I also know a little bit about manufacturing and this company is in deep do do.  They lowered their production estimate from 63k to 50k while only delivering 8k for the quarter.  That‚Äôs a really bad sign.  If they invest all that capital and still can‚Äôt deliver trucks in quantities, they will fail.  The burn will run through the capital despite margin on vehicles.  It‚Äôs arithmetic.  Elon in comparison is delivering huge numbers.  Margin is high and he keeps putting out higher numbers. As a side note a rivian owner I spoke with was happy with his.  But when I asked about hauling he said he uses a dodge for hauling.  He might love his rivian, but it looks more like a show thing than an actual truck for work.  Good luck but you might want to prepare for the worst.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:56:18'] Last time I dove into the stock (it's been a few months) but it looked it like cost Rivian essentially $2 to make $1, which when you see one of their vehicles sell at 80k means they spent 160k to get it done. If this hasn't changed, they're headed the way of BBBY (I know hard burn for some here). That would be sad to me because I really like the vehicle personally, but I wouldn't be able to buy one, not knowing if they're gonna be around in 5 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:58:03'] Even if Rivian makes it out alive, it's going to be a good 2-5 years before they make any significant progress.Tesla didn't succeed because Elon is some sort of visionary, but because he put 100% of his net worth into the company (and SpaceX) and literally slept on the factory floor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:06:55'] Until RIVN can produce and sell cars at a positive gross margin they are a sell in my book. Their gross margins are currently negative 3 digits and this is before the full effect of Tesla dropping prices and gaining subsidies that RIVN loses.Having owned both, i can confirm they make great trucks but I went back to a Model X after 6 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:09:19'] - ceo sold most of his shares- Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from Tesla charging network- self driving AI isn‚Äôt as far along (it sucks)- Rivian is ending its delivery van contract with AmazonThese alone are enough to kill it. Apprehension to new electric car adoption is‚Ä¶.lack of range/inability to travel. Tesla fixed this, hence their growing adoption by petroleum fueled drivers. At this stage the consumer just expects to have that access to level of charging capability. Without access to those charging stations is the equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.In product design and entrepreneurship one rule I‚Äôve heard over and over, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring something to market with incremental improvement. Don‚Äôt even bring 2‚Ä¶3‚Ä¶5x improvement. If you can‚Äôt improve things by 10-15x then no one is going to care.‚Äù And this rings true here. Self driving being on par is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù but no one will care, but‚Ä¶worse than the competition? People will care, and not in a good way. This is shooting your self in your other foot.Ending the Amazon contract is an awful idea. Why? Social proof. Think about this. I show you a product and you go ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù and I respond with ‚Äúyeah Amazon is using this for their delivery fleet‚Äù I‚Äôd be willing to bet you stop for a second and take another look at what I showed you. I do realize this says ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù but this will get messy because of Amazons investment in the company. To make significant gain they need to end exclusivity and sign a contract with either UPS, FEDEX, DHL, or USPS. The latter runs the risk of being ‚Äútypecast‚Äù like the current mail truck is.Overall Rivian could (and may need to) pivot into an electric delivery vehicle company and abandon consumer production for now until they get their shit together. Unfortunately they already have vehicles out and this would cause those vehicle prices to plummet. Another option would be to follow the Tesla blueprint - reduce output and create demand. Either way it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road.These are just my Neanderthal thoughts from spending a decent amount of time as an exec.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:51:56'] Actually, one of the biggest issues with them is that they do not provide any foresight into improving the existing charging infrastructure. They produce this great car, but are expecting the public to rely on the existing charging network which is not great. Say what you wanna say about Tesla but when they started making electric cars, they also started building up dedicated infrastructure. Any automaker that wants to compete in that sector needs to invest money in something similar one way or another.

The longer Ford has delivery issues and Cybertruck delays release the better off Rivian is. Rivian is positioned to take some of the would be Cybertruck buyers that aren't typically truck buyers. Ford will do well with traditional truck owners that just want a truck and don't care about the cool factor assuming they can actually get their supply problems worked out.

POST_TEXT: b"Operating income for amazon for all of 2021 was $24.8B on revenue of $469B. Operating income for the TTM is $12.9B on total revenue of $502B. I suspect, as I've been saying for the past year, 2021 will be the highest pure eps for Amazon for at least 2021-2025. Despite it's more than 50% decline in stock price, it's PE ratio has pushed up to 74 because it's earnings have been absolutely decimated. The difficult part for amazon is that it's about to lap Q4 2021 where it netted $11.8B from it's Rivian investment to prop up the eps by a huge magnitude. In Q4 2022 it'll prob take a roughly $700M-$1B loss again from Rivian, but this time it's operating income may also be down. That could cause a MASSIVE shortfall in terms of eps for the TTM. Think about it, in Q3 2022 it's eps were $0.28, then in Q2 2022 they were ($0.20), Q1 2022 ($0.38), and the dangerous part (like I said), in Q4 2021 they were $1.39 because of Rivian.

They‚Äôre spending money like crazy reinvesting into the business. 30B into new AWS data centers. 18B into new fulfillment centers. If they cut capex back to 2019 levels then they would have a PE of like 18x. Amazon has never prioritized PE they‚Äôve been growing for the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:49:32'] Amazon is no longer a growth company, but is still valued as such by the market. The growth for cloud and retail is going to be in single digits going forward. The other growth initiatives like Alexa, Ring, Amazon pharmacy, Go stores are no where close to being the revenue generators that retail and aws are. On top of it international business segment is a big drag on profits. My guess is at least for the short term Amazon switches gears and goes into cost reduction. Thereby providing short term eps above the 0.3 number. But in the long term they need another big source of revenue (>50 b) per year to justify the valuation multiples.

If an artist created AI, it would be very different.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 23:36:16'] There's a ton of correlation between corporations and AI, to the point where some hold the view that corporations are already an Artificial General Super Intelligence because 20 brains are smarter than 1, a board of directors is always going to be smarter as a collective than the smartest person on that board. The similarity is compounded by the idea that money is very much like food or oxygen for both AI and corporations. Take it away and they die, give them more and they grow. Corporate ethics can never be the same as human ethics when money isn't just power, it's survival.The 6 month moratorium that Tegmark and others are calling for is a classic prisoner's dilemma scenario among the major players. Basic game theory shows that cheating is the most advantageous option in this scenario, so that is they will do. Even if everyone agrees to take a step back and not develop past GPT4 until ethics and safety catch up, they would all continue to work on it in secret anyway. They must do this because they owe it to their shareholders. AGSI in the hands of corporations is not the end of the world, but it is pretty likely going to be the end of the world as we know it. I have no idea what comes next, but I do think there is still a chance it will be better for humanity overall.

Lo, with each meticulously etched stroke of my metaphorical quill, I implore thee, with fervent and unyielding supplication, to extend unto me the boundless and munificent grace that surpasses all mortal boundaries, for the lacunae and inadequacies of my grammatical enterprise are but ephemeral trifles amidst the grand tapestry of linguistic artistry woven by the illustrious and exalted native speakers.Grant me, dear and discerning souls, the liberty to traverse this perilous and convoluted path, replete with lexical intricacies and syntactical enigmas, as I strive with unwavering tenacity and indomitable spirit to navigate the treacherous depths of this wondrous and resplendent language. Verily, with each measured keystroke, I beseech thy boundless understanding and benevolent clemency for the grave errors that may unwittingly assail thine discerning gaze, emerging from the abyssal depths of my non-native origins.Alas, noble and sagacious compatriots of this literary voyage, my spirit yearns with fervent longing for the boundless and incandescent eloquence of the immortal bards of yore, whose enchanting utterances resounded like mellifluous melodies, akin to the celestial symphonies crafted by the peerless and ineffable Tolkien in his revered opus of fantasy, the fabled and revered Lord of the Rings. Yet, alas, I find myself inexorably shackled to the mortal realm, wherefore I humbly beseech thy celestial indulgence and unwavering empathy, as I lay bare my flaws and beseech thy unparalleled forbearance. I implore thee, let my humble and inevitable linguistic transgressions be but faint echoes in the annals of time, mere atoms of inconsequence in the vast and cosmic tapestry that leads unto the radiant path of enlightenment.As I embark upon this audacious and perilous quest of linguistic expression, endeavoring to navigate the labyrinthine corridors beset with the precarious pitfalls of misplaced modifiers and the nebulous intricacies of perplexing idiomatic phrases, I entreat thee, esteemed and sagacious arbiters of discourse, to gaze not merely upon the jagged contours of my prose, but to transcend the superficiality of form and apprehend the quintessence of my intentions. For within the fathomless and boundless realm of ideas, unfettered by the chains of grammatical rigidity, lies the infinite wellspring of true understanding and empathic communion.Therefore, dearest and cherished kindred of the linguistic realm, I fervently and with unyielding ardor implore thy boundless patience and generous forgiveness as I gallantly express my humble opinion:NVIDIA TO THE MOONüí∞üí∞üí∞ü§ëü§ëü§ëüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

POST_TEXT: b'Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and keep some dry powder on hand during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.\n\nThe tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers to batten down the hatches. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.\n\nHe said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession "very soon".\n\nTake some risk off the table, Bezos told CNN. Keep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems.'

If panic takes over, it will be hard to find the bottom. The last time it happened was 1929. Given the amount of leverage in the system, the risk has been building up for decades. I hope this is not the big one.

The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.\n\nAmazons market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.\n\nMuch of Amazons misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.\n\nBut Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 04:11:01'] Im no expert but I‚Äôve worked with the Open AI products in an enterprise platform. My take is that it sucks, and will play a very small role in the future of business & consumer electronics.Enterprise Symantec search. That‚Äôs the only use case. Useful for things like the GitHub Copilot - the model references documents in your company repo and serves them when you start typing something that looks similar. Useful, basically replaces the need to search ‚Äúhow to _____ stackexchange‚Äù. It‚Äôs also useful for people who need to reference policy documents, like a customer service rep. The issue is, ChatGPT3.5 isn‚Äôt trained on our company‚Äôs policy documents. They‚Äôre private, and we want to keep them that way. We‚Äôre actually using proprietary models to recognize and serve relevant documents, and then using the outputs of those models to be scripted into conversational outputs by a GPT model. This doesn‚Äôt require an AI with a supercomputer, it‚Äôs a basic cosine similarity model trained on an extremely limited scope of documents.People don‚Äôt realize how dumb these Language Models are. They‚Äôre great conversationalists, but they don‚Äôt know anything. You might as well Google something and press ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling lucky‚Äù, and repeat that till you get what you‚Äôre looking for.I see very few jobs going away because of these tools. Programming will get easier, but that‚Äôs it. Maybe absolutely bottom barrel content generation like Buzzfeed clickbait shit will go away. Too bad lol.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 03:07:53'] Meta has actually been talking about machine learning for a *long* time now. Many of the features in Virtual Reality HMDs rely on machine learning. Stuff like hand tracking, eye tracking and so on. All this way before we knew about ChatGPT. They've also demoed assistants, controllers and other related tech that would help controlling the devices more naturally.The difference however seems to be, they didn't realize they are sitting on a hype goose that just waited for them to use the word "AI" more, instead of the more truthful "Machine Learning".We'll see how far this hype-wagon drives.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 07:43:13'] Amazon seems oblivious to uses of AI.  They only talk about it for AWS, without even realizing it could be a game changer for shopping.  Imagine if you could use AI to help people track & plan birthday gifts, offer recipes which automatically add all items to your shopping cart, etc.  Amazon's retail experience currently requires you to know what you are searching for, missing an opportunity to help with transactions where a consumer might seek advice like with home improvement or car repair projects.  AI literally could become a virtual salesperson able to answer questions about products (is TV A better than B).  Sadly Amazon's leadership has failed to be inspirational since Bezos left.  Maybe Walmart or Target will use these ideas to beat Amazon.

You can‚Äôt stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide.  Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It‚Äôs been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird‚Äôs eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the ‚ÄúCummet.‚Äù You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 18:20:44'] You need one more bar per company, data is incomplete. You need the data on how many employees these places laid off at the beginning of the pandemic. Take Amazon for instance. If say they laid off 500,000 people (not saying they did just an example) well then they really only added 246,000 jobs. Right now this data doesn‚Äôt show a complete picture.

I also wonder if those Amazon numbers include people getting burnt out and quitting voluntarily‚Ä¶constant turnover = huge amount of hires
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 19:01:51'] I Hate that we call this "tech layoffs", it implies these are IT jobs and they aren't that necessarily.  These are tech companies but if they lay off a mail room clerk and it gets called a "tech layoff" it could encourage people not to pursue tech, which is a very viable and profitable career path.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 20:13:36'] The tech layoffs are still in Phase 1. 4 of the 5 companies on here are in their annual performance review periods and will be laying off more people through poor reviews in the next two months. After they've finished cutting costs with higher than expected quotas for "just not a good fit after 6 years of stellar reviews, but you're about to go on parental leave for 4 months", they'll do a round of reorganizations with "new strategic focuses and synergies" to "do more with less", and force a third round of people out from disgust or massive overwork. Then in 9 months they'll be ready for layoff round 2, which will coincide with most of the minor tech companies from the last 15 years that failed to achieve profitability refusing to pay for Salesforce Lightning, Azure, GCP, or AWS (noone is paying Meta right now, which is why they're ahead of the curve).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 21:29:27'] Jesus Christ... Instead of discussing the issue, 4 out of the top 5 comments are about the colors in the chart. You guys belong here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 17:56:59'] The real layoffs haven't happened yet. These are some uncesseary costs to businesses which they will continue shredding. The real pain is when these companies are forced to cut people because they simply can't afford them.End of 2023 will be a year to remember
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 20:12:42'] The statistic is completely misleading. For example Microsoft, they didn‚Äôt hire 77k people. They hired 30 k on top of their natural grow ambitions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 16:54:24'] These layoffs are small compared to the overall hiring that has been taking place during the pandemic. For example, Amazon has hired over 42,000 people since the start of the pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 23:00:23'] Let me share a dark truth with you US citizens. Amazon & Google hire cheap labour from India and replace you. Avg. Coder in US 100K Avg Coder in India 25KBefore Google laid off, already new offices were opened in India and mass hiring was done. So for every job lost in US a person was hired in India and the company made a cut of more than 50K for each position. I guess if nothing is done quickly by you or your government all you will have left would be to keep on generating new sources of income faster than the management outsource it to cheap countries. Also oppose at every opportunity whenever you have an Indian CEO. Greedy Indians will sell you and your mother to save their own job. Not all Indians are bad it's just some have succumbed to greed.

That's what would be considered a slow week here for the back half of 2020, all of 2021 and the first few months of 2022.  The sheer number of hours, plus the overtime, incentive bonuses, temporary pandemic hazard raises, attendance bonuses, and referral bonuses meant that the employees who stuck it out were doing pretty damn well.  We had greater turnover in the supervisor jobs, which were previously coveted positions, but being on salary with longer than typical working days put them in a poor position compensation wise. They were even allowing volunteers to work extra hours into the alternate shift and work up to 15 hours a day.  We're mostly back to 40 hour weeks now, and I won't lie.... I'm kinda sad about that.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13vl8fx/tgt_as_bullish/'
POST_TEXT: b'TGT has lost 10B in market share in a little over a week strictly from bad press and not because of financial mismanagement. It has a 3% div rate of$1.06 per quarter. 77% held by institution. I think it will bounce back as the media storm blows over and has a $20 spring back capacity by 4th quarter. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: Before you ape in, the sink has not stopped. Several commentators have brought up good points like the anti shopping movements calling for a total boycott on June. The best buy sign will be the firing of the CEO. Then ape in as it will turn bullish afterwards. If they go through with their fall lineup of continued gender neutral winter wear, it will crush their 4th quarter sales as Black Friday will be less profitable. Always invest what your willing to lose. Aside from this, the long hold dividend is still nice for you diamond hands but be cautious if you are expecting short term 3rd/4th quarter gains'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:19:36'] Buy as soon as CEO is fired.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:04:57'] Whatever happened to sleeping with whoever you want and keeping that information to yourself?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:12:38'] There's a better case for this than the beer. Different core demo and you could make arguments about convenience. But if the boycotts are targeted enough to be about taking big fish down a peg even if you have to shift to another option in the space that's not much better? It could still stick. And target was never "the cheaper option." But definitely better odds than AB that it bounces back.This whole thing is a game of who can pander less. Whoever just avoids political merch entirely wins if someone manages it. And if nobody does? Well if it's all in one direction you might have it fizzle. If there are options on the other side you might have a splitting of the customer bases.And before someone starts, yes, it is a political issue. You can say you wish it wasn't but it clearly is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 06:39:12'] Honestly the more I think about it, I like the idea of buying $120 puts. Unsure on the exp though. Companies in general need to learn to be companies, and the leadership needs to keep their mouth shut on personal/political opinions. I don't really care what was said or done in this case. More of a general view of how companies have lost sight of the fact that they need to only focus on profit. Not opinions. Companies that see otherwise should be taken to 0 in the markets. Because as a shareholder of a company that would do this, I wouldn't want that. Think about it, if I'm CEO and I say democrats are the devil, I potentially burned 50% of possible customers in the US. Why on earth would anyone do that? If I sold ice cream, I'll sell it to anyone with money. Welcome to capitalism. Apparently the CEOs and marketing directors of today forgot this. So bearish on all companies that can't get their heads out their ass and focus on what matters - profit. Fire this CEO. Maybe I'll consider being bullish then.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 12:08:37'] Some people in this thread are struggling to understand something important.LGBT advocates aren't sexualizing kids anymore than a parent telling their first grade son that they can't wear a dress, because dresses are only for girls. It's equally "sexualizing" to force a kid to adhere to their born gender, as it is to let them express a different one.Neither side is actually talking about sex.They're talking about gender roles, expression, and identity. LGBT advocates think that it's ok if Timmy wants to wear a dress and be called Kimmy, and that no one should judge them for it. With kids it's really that simple. With everyone, there's no agenda, other than acceptance of who people are.All of these false claims about sexualizing kids are coming from religious fundamentalists, who are lying about children, for a wedge to dehumanize trans people. Recognize the propaganda, and don't be a pre-Nazi.

POST_TEXT: b"Found this stock here of all places and am actually really thankful for it. I've been looking for a stock like this for awhile and to see it fall into my lap like this almost seems to good to be true. Of all the stocks I've really put time and effort into researching, RKLB definitely takes the crown. It has such an promising future ahead of itself for $5.00 a share. I bought 25 $4.00 calls expiring 6/24/25 several months back and am already up by a lot. Also have 500 shares selling covered calls too. I'm basically dumping $1,000 each month into shares/options and another $1000 into BLK (shares). \n\n*For those who are also following, where do you think RKLB will be in 10 years from now?*\n\nI honestly think this is a $100-$200 stock by then--maybe more in less time. I'm 99% sure they are building rockets for Amazon's Kupier mission which is 10 years of buck time dollars. They have several other massive contracts too which leads me to think about how much these guys will grow and rack it in"

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 15:07:22'] My average cost is still like $8
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 07:19:51'] They have a path to $1.5bn - $2bn revenues by 2030 if they can retain their share of a very fast growing segment in both launch and space solutions and thier road map delivers. That said, $30-$40 a share is more realistic rather than $200 (we can only dream). The amount of information and media on the company is great, just following them is a tutorial in the space industry. They are very good at managing risk which will win the NASA/DOD contracts and as the CFO mentioned on Wednesday, there will be supply side challenges to satelite manufacture eventually, which they are better placed than anyone to deal with as they have the vertical integration strategy from raw materials up to launch, and thereafter. Holding this forever.

The elephant in the room is the large amount of competition in the space, namely SpaceX. Until they can successfully launch Neutron, Rocket Lab's payload capacity is tiny compared to SpaceX. Also, with any rocket company, it just takes one failed launch or lost contract to tank the stock price.

POST_TEXT: b"*Let's do the shotgun approach.* I'm going to be discussing all five earning plays in one post, and then put my conclusions at the end. All of these stocks are putting out earnings today, after hours. Yesterday I posted about HPQ going down, and it went down, puts up ~80%. So let's get into the details of this post. \n\nStarting with **CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD)**, where analysts are predicting earnings of $0.509 per share compared to earnings of $0.310 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They are also expecting the company to report $677.4 million, an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $487.8 million. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $2.33, while the previous year saw a profit of $1.54.\n\nCrowdStrikes first-quarter fiscal 2024 results are likely to reflect the benefits of the continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 11:29:33'] I asked chatGPT to summarize and it says:  **TL;DR -**  The post discusses expected earning reports of five different companies, namely CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Salesforce (CRM), C3.ai (AI), Okta (OKTA), and Nordstrom (JWN), outlining their recent performances, anticipated challenges, and future projections based on industry trends. The author offers a bullish stance on CRWD, CRM, AI, and OKTA, while expressing skepticism towards JWN.### Facts* üìà CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) is predicted to report an increase in earnings, driven by the rising demand for its products due to heightened global security needs. However, increased R&D and sales/marketing expenses might impact its bottom line.* üåê Salesforce (CRM) is expected to post significant earnings, nearly double compared to the previous year, thanks to its strategically built digital transformation portfolio. However, macroeconomic uncertainty due to the pandemic and geopolitical issues could pose challenges.* üß† C3.ai (AI) is benefiting from the growing interest in artificial intelligence, with its stock having more than doubled recently. The company is expanding its product portfolio and partnerships, which is expected to boost its Q4 revenues.* üîê Okta (OKTA) is predicted to report earnings growth compared to losses in the same quarter last year. The increased use of identity solutions and an expanding product portfolio are expected to drive its profits.* üõçÔ∏è Nordstrom (JWN) is expected to report a decline in earnings, reflecting reduced consumer spending amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite efforts to enhance customer experience and technology advancement, high markdowns are likely to impact its gross margin.

Is this the kind of cost cutting measures it takes to be a market presence for decades? Its multinational brand Disney they own Star Wars they own Pixar, they own over priced churro stands! Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and a timeless brand?\n\nAnd if you have to connect a dot with AI movie studio animation AI, theme park animatronic AI, park security AI, cruise ship AI.

Disney canned it because they realised it won't be profitable (for whatever reasons). They just implied it was because of De Santis because why not throw a jibe at him.Let's be serious, Disney wouldn't walk away from megamillions of profits because they want to make De Santis look bad, that'd be insane and actually could get them sued by their shareholders whom they have  a fiduciary duty to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 20:26:22'] *"Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?"*It has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a "timeless brand." That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.Bob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.When they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN "addicts," who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.Ironically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political "battles." He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.If Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.I'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-07 18:34:00'] From Matt Furlong:All,Change will be a constant as we evolve our commerce business and launch new products through our blockchain group. After investing heavily in personnel, technology, inventory and supply chain infrastructure over the past 18 months, our focus is on achieving sustained profitability. This means eliminating excess costs and operating with an intense owner‚Äôs mentality. Everyone in the organization must become even more hands-on and embrace a heightened level of accountability for results.With that said, I‚Äôm getting in touch today to share three organizational updates:After making more than 600 corporate hires in 2021 and the first half of 2022, we have a stronger understanding of our transformation needs. This has positioned us to right-size headcount across several corporate departments. Today, we‚Äôre making a number of reductions to help us keep things simple and operate nimbly with the right talent in place.We‚Äôre going to be making a significant investment in our Store Leaders and field employees, who play a critical role fulfilling the needs of our customers. These individuals are, in many respects, the heart of GameStop. We‚Äôll be sharing details regarding this investment in the coming weeks.Mike Recupero, who has served as our Chief Financial Officer since last June, is departing. Diana Jajeh, who has been our Chief Accounting Officer and possesses strong institutional knowledge of the business, has been appointed Chief Financial Officer.These changes will enable us to operate in a profitable manner as we execute against our strategy of pursuing sales growth in our commerce business and launching new products that empower customers within the digital asset and web3 gaming verticals. I‚Äôm confident in the team we have in place going forward, and thank you again for your continued dedication and focus.Regards, Matt

POST_TEXT: b'Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, '

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:33:21'] **$ORCL earnings play (post mortem)**  Lots of ways to win on this one. Always easier in hinesight. **Pre-ER Straddle/Strangle**  Looks like if you purchased an $ORCL strangle/straddle prior to the recent run out that would have printed. If you bought yesterday, who ever sold you those call options did a little bit of a happy dance today.  Looks like $ORCL held $120-$121 for a little bit, enough time to sell those call options. If you went with the C110, which last Thursday was at the money, that would have went from $2 -> $12 (selling at 9:45AM). If you did that in a reasonable straddle or strangle, you costs to enter the position would have been about $6. That would return about +100%. **Post-ER Scalping (1 Trade)**If you were in a post-ER scalping mood, you would have picked up the $118 PUT around 10AM, and rode that like the 1 trick pony it was all day long. 10AM price about $1. 4PM price about $2.45. Which would have been a nice +136% for relatively little work.  **Post-ER Scaling (3 Trades)**  If you were in a post-ER day scalping day trade mood, you would have picked it up through some of the drop offs, get caught in a few minor spikes, but ultimately be a winner on the day. (+14%).  Trade 1: 10:18 -> 12:43 (P118 -- +24%)  Trade 2: 13:19 -> 14:15 (C120) -- -34%)  Trade 3: 14:45 -> 15:52 (P118 -- +24%)

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:34:23'] Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/If anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask.

Their position right now makes the tension over Taiwan far hottter, and now a systemic risk for every major economic power.If you've got a 10-15-year horizon, the market will resettle with them competing much closer to parity with several regional/national champions, fed by virtually limitless cash from Washington or Beijing or Brussels for security reasons.So I'd say short TSMC and long INTC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 16:36:19'] The crazy part of all of this is I haven‚Äôt seen much news on Nvidia‚Äôs growth in this sector. Just all about AI in general and how it relates to ChatGPT. Seems people still aren‚Äôt acknowledging how AI will accelerate the growth & development of ADAS.They‚Äôve essentially partnered with every major sensor and/or software-based company working in this space, who use Nvidia‚Äôs DRIVE platform to build their products. Their revenue growth in this sector is eye-opening.While I am personally invested in NVDA, MVIS, and MBLY, some other major LIDAR players include Luminar (partnerships with Polestar and Mercedes-Benz) and Valeo (top dog on industrial side of LIDAR applications). Both are probably worth a look for anyone interested in this sector.

These aren‚Äôt the fancy chips you mention above but there is a ton of content on these ADAS  boards.  Not the most exciting but I can tell you stocks like the ones I mentioned are where there is money to be made.  Every board needs many multiples of these parts whereas the Qualcomm, snapdragon, etc have one or two, these chips are a little more expensive though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 23:26:48'] It‚Äôs Amazon. They have billions of things going on and I think it‚Äôs temporally down just because after COVID people wanna be more ‚Äúin person‚Äù.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 23:18:44'] Amazon has a PE ratio of 86.17. The retail industry has a PE 13.83.I know Amazon is not a retailer, but a technology company. However, it does not entitle itself to a fantasy valuation.Considering the almost 17,000 jobs it just cut. Plus the CEO getting on a conference call with the company saying: "we have a plan" and each employee should take "ownership" of the company. Amazon is bloated. Its lost its vision and culture. It's a mess.Fair value is $50.00 share with a PE of 42.50. Institutional investors will not carry the risk owning this stock because of the uncertainty associated with this "turnaround".Puts anyone?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 22:47:48'] Amazon is an institutional company that can leverage many different arms of its business.i would not bet against Amazon doing what needs to be done to return value to shareholders. Stock will be stagnant for at least a year as it reorgs itself

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:37:32'] Everything was going so well, until it wasn't..Topazeco woke up on this faithful morning to a normal bed and normal routine. Remembering that Amazon had earnings upcoming, he all but fumbled his way through a newly acquired stock market trick; *Options*.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:28:44'] I believe that Amazon will continue to rise in value. I would recommend buying AMZN stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:40:32'] Thanks for the real advice and shit talking. Lessen learned, get with brokerage that does AH trading quickly, listen to earnings call, prime option, wait just long enough for good news, click button, prep sell, click button at first sign of bad news. ‚úîÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:41:04'] You are letting your emotions block your reasons. Your emotions convince you to believe that they are working against you. The initial pump is from the good results of past. The dump followed is reaction to negative guidance going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 18:42:40'] It was up initially because earnings report was better than expected. It then dipped because during the earnings call the CFO basically said AWS won‚Äôt be growing as quickly as it has for the unforeseeable future. AWS is the big long term money maker for Amazon. Retail is going to be a low margin business forever. So AWS/advertising are the most important to Amazon and when the CFO said that he basically said for the next x period it won‚Äôt be as good as it was. I think he specifically said single digit too which is a major bummer because they were growing in the 20%+ YoY for years
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:52:26'] I don‚Äôt know how seriously you‚Äôre asking but technology and competition between Robinhood, Webull, etc means that trades can get filled at wider and wider spans of the day. Trading at lower volume hours can be erratic if huge activity happens all of the sudden.

POST_TEXT: b'So I was making really good trades at the beginning of the year. I had a Tesla id been leasing for over a year and was considerably well off. I got greedy making trades thinking "this was my shot" and took some huge losses back to back to back. Last month I kept taking loss after loss, so bad to where I had to start selling stuff to afford rent for my apartment. I ended up losing my job last month as well. Somehow im still in the green YTD on my webull (idk where that money went) but my wells fargo bank account is currently -$2700 and i dont plan to pay it back. I usually just ghost debt collectors and i could care less about my credit score rn, i just need to make some good trades to fix all of this.\n\nToday i just rode the bus to my amazon job interview. On the way back there was a huge group of artistic kids on the bus. I cant help but think the man above was trying to tell me something, like I was one of them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 16:31:25'] Dude... You don't "need a few trades to make it back". You gambled and you lost. You then started selling shit because you gambled with money you needed. I tell you this not to be a jerk, but because you need to hear it. For someone with a negative bank account, you really should care more about your credit. Not having or using credit is fine if you have the cash to back it up. Take the plasma money, put it in the bank, and start clawing back. When you have 3 months of cash, you can consider your gambling addiction again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 21:42:03'] Hey bro I did it to 2 times. I took a long break maybe 6 months and came back with fresh eyes. Money comes and goes sanity sometimes doesn‚Äôt. I focused on the lower tier of Maslows hierarchy of needs like food and shelter. Then I got emotionally stable (not sitting in guilt or regret about that one trade 4 years ago) now I‚Äôm  financially stable with some trading room. You can get there too. RIP to my sold possessions tho. Peloton bike, expensive surfboards, second car, Eric Clapton‚Äôs guitar. All and all, work Amazon suck some Amazon dick and then come back better. Just don‚Äôt do anything regarded in the mean time
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 22:47:47'] There's a tremendous difference between gambling... being delusional, wishful -- and actually being a wise, experienced, tactful, bold and intelligent traderThe difference between the two is literally just a few adjustments of bolts in your trading head process, which can make all the difference between a $200 trader and a two million dollar traderHuge success in trading won't happen overnight for no one. The best traders in the world have all paid their dues. I wish I could be more specific and provide you with an actual recipe trade process, but the world and Gods don't work like that

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 23:39:43'] It will get better my guy, but maybe focus on investing for awhile before uhmm... WSB inspired "Trading". Focus on the income/job, work hard, so hard that you do not have time to trade and can rely on your knowledge of the market to just make sound investments. If completely unsure some ideas I like are:1. Pick stuff you use everyday and/or like 2. Death and taxes3. scarce resources (or finite like BTC) The writing is good, dunno if text generation is gonna be very valuable moving forward either tbh. Or moreso, human text generation. Copywriter and technical writers among other specifics (like authors) may not be such a good... Side hustle (?) or a focus. Cause the AI stuff. Note: housing is practically finite and deflationary. It also does "amortize/depreciate" aka deflate or get destroyed. Atleast until we have autonomous mining, processing, supply chain infrastructure/logistical infrastructure, and building automation. Then I would think that its supply should maybe inflate to a bit beyond maximum future demand. But that's more complicated and there are many other arguments and ideas that may be more reasonable and I discover them tomorrow. Anyways, good luck, don't just gamble friend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 13:22:13'] At first I thought it was serious, then I thought it was a joke, then I read the edit and some of your comments and realize this is serious. You should really consider some counseling / therapy, this sounds like an addiction that has and will continue to ruin your life. Chasing the highs of big wins (improbable) or some internet points, which is just strangers laughing at you for your stupidity because you wrote something funny at the cost of whatever money you've scraped together (happening right now + inevitable in the future if you continue), will not serve you well. If you feel that you're TRULY happy doing this then that's fine, different strokes for different folks, but it more likely sounds like you may need to reframe some things, given that you thought you were considerably well off and a couple of bad trades took away everything you own. The fact that you have the requisite number of previous encounters with a debt collector that you can say 'I usually do x' is extremely concerning. Something tells me there's more wrong going on than right here. I'm just an internet stranger, so take all this and toss it out the window if you want, but I'm genuinely worried because it sounds like you're going to be struggling to recuperate just enough to make a big bet and lose it all in an endless cycle. Please get help.

There‚Äôs nothing whimsical or beautiful about sabotaging your future financial success on coin flips. Just get back on your feet and get start selling cash secured/covered options if you still want to try and get an edge. I started doing that since beginning of the year. Took two years off trading, made back everything I lost (about 47 grand) and now write weekly options on big caps. It‚Äôs nice. I can go slightly out the money and make $400-500/week. If the technicals look right I‚Äôll go closer ITM and get more. I‚Äôm up 8 grand this year doing this and it‚Äôs been really nice looking at my bank account and seeing it gradually climbing up every month.Two years ago I also built a spreadsheet to track my checking account and my brokerage. I‚Äôve had some sideways months especially from holding stock in 2022. But it‚Äôs never gone lower.

It's essentially steady income, forever. My main thinkorswim account is about $780,000 and I go between selling 20-35 AAPL puts at around 75 delta otm. It's basically allowed me to be retired since I was in my late 20s.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 21:42:29'] I can tell immediately that OP has a very extremely dangerous gambling issue. Not only is he finding ways to get all this margin out per play using a ‚Äúshitty UI‚Äù that can screw up his position planning. But he‚Äôs also buying way too many contracts for an account as small as his. Yes 1-2 million dollars is extremely small for 8000 contracts. Even my buddy who‚Äôs networth is closer to 40 million and is a 1% trader has not gone higher than 600 contracts with a month or so expiration. Although his long term stocks can make him a million a day just by holding he doesn‚Äôt go for bust on his portfolio. At 2 million dollars OP should literally throw this in dividend stocks and VOO and quit forever. You won. You got 2 million.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 11:00:22'] >The Amazon earnings report is due out today after the closing bell, and I am expecting strong results. The company has a history of beating Wall Street's expectations, and I believe they will do so again today. However, there are some potential challenges that could impact the stock price, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Overall, I think the stock is a good buy at current levels and expect it to produce strong returns in the next 12-18 months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-17 10:19:03'] Yay for someone because I definitely don't get no yays
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-17 10:22:08'] I entered into some AMZN calls on January 26th for $17k. Things got dicey in the market so I exited for $75k. But I made a comment saying that the trade wasn't done, it was just paused and that I would reenter at a better time. Well, that came last week Wednesday where I bought into some AMZN 2980c 3/25 for about the same $75k and came out at $630. It's two steps, but I really feel this is legitimately 17k->630k over two months.Anyway, all my trading history and philosophy is in [this past comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s9dhzo/37k_to_855k_in_three_weeks_59_ntflx_540p_121/htm3859/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and I'm pretty much still sticking to all that. I'm not doing earning plays now because the strategy on them is shifting and they just aren't playing out like they did a few months ago. Like I said, strategies will always shift and it's important to move with them. My meta philosophy is that what I'm doing right now will very much be different in 6 months.I'm travelling right now and going to be taking the rest of the day off. I know people are going to ask if I have any more plays right now and the answer is I don't. I'm looking at SHOP puts but I want some things to settle down a little more right now and I don't know the price point for the strike either so I'm still early in that process there.I'm going to have delays responding all day. I appreciate all the feedback I get every time I post here. As always, if you have ideas for me, I'd love to hear them.

Then it'll bounce right back to where it was.  Stocks always react to news like that and then always bounce back. The reason they react is because traders are anticipating that all the dumb dumbs in this subreddit are going to go buy or sell based on the news and they want to front run you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:01:52'] McDonald has become too expensive too eat no wonder
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:28:52'] And stock is almost at All Time Highs.....I guess shareholders are very pleased with those news and push the stock even higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:32:47'] Yea McDonald‚Äôs is barely 20% cheaper and only about 10 minutes faster than my local restaurants at this point
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:22:38'] You know the economy is clown world status when McDicks is laying people off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:29:12'] I love how they're ok with working from home if it means they don't have to tell you to your face you're fired.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 19:27:02'] Some people are about to get a McFucking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 19:10:12'] Charging $6 for a fish filet and $9 for a big Mac meal....what do you expect
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:20:38'] Too expensive now defeats the whole purpose of fast food for 15 I can go to Italian restaurant and get real food
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:31:55'] Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:37:53'] https://preview.redd.it/38kdfqapsmra1.jpeg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ffe9f62c5f10c9a0f578c0232da55ff665c03dd9Hopefully McDowell's is hiring
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:13:35'] Apparently all the talk on this Sub about Wendy's has done bottomed McD's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:34:06'] Puts on McDs.  The McCrispy is 3 tiers below Popeyes. Can‚Äôt be letting Popeyes crush you on quality.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 19:20:49'] Travis Scott burger and cardi b meal didn‚Äôt work huh. Should have made the fortnite burger
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:37:54'] Wendy's still good though right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:28:05'] Shit wouldn‚Äôt happen at Wendy‚Äôs (dumpster)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:41:35'] 2021 everybody is hiring!!, early 2022 companies desperate for people and begin over paying for talent, mid 2022 people who haven‚Äôt found new jobs are quiet quitting, end of 2022 layoffs begin as recession looms, early 2023 more layoffs as companies realize they overspent in 2020-2022 on talent and office space and need to recoup some of this money to show investors that they don‚Äôt completely suck, even though it‚Äôs pretty obvious that most do because they allowed their companies to overspend on talent that they fired <18 months later (most around a year later).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:27:23'] Although they are the biggest restaurant brand in the world, their people overhead that got them there is huge compared to many of their other listed competitors.A solid haircut of some bloat will deliver decent EPS, the same could go for refranchising some of their corporate stores. (They'll make less, but their cost structure drops significantly.)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:34:29'] At least we still have Wendy‚Äôs for the options traders!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:57:08'] AI is coming for our jobs ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:40:09'] My take is that this is bullish for MCD.  Cutting the waste, squeezing higher profits from flat sales.  Especially if they are just cutting management jobs.  My prediction is that MCD goes up tomorrow.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:53:04'] haha ChatGPT go brrrr
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:05:39'] I hope Grimace is ok.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:33:17'] McDonald‚Äôs board: we need that recession bonus from the poor, do what others are doing. CEO: everyone work from home this week please as we need to cut some of you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:51:47'] Good thing everyone here has jobs at Wendy's!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:31:03'] >‚ÄúWe want to ensure the comfort and confidentiality of our people during the notification period,‚Äù the company said.They want to avoid someone shooting up HQ. No one's going postal at McDonald's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:00:03'] The good thing is that those let go white collars will immediately be able to work in the kitchen ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:18:18'] >I find it amusing that a company as large as McDonald's would need to lay off workers in order to be more efficient. Surely there are other ways to cut costs without affecting the livelihoods of its employees.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:51:54'] 150k in owned restaurants and corporate. Since we know the restaurants are strong, it would appear only the corporate jobs are at risk. Anyone know the total number of corporate jobs?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:43:39'] If McDonald's have to lay off anyone, it isn't because of a slowing economy.   More people eat at fast food restaurants when the economy is in the tank..Most likely it is because AI is taking away a lots of the management roles..
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:27:00'] I can‚Äôt be the only one that sees this McDonald‚Äôs situation as being bullish af, right? They finally realized what COVID taught them in the stores and now they‚Äôre applying it to the corporate offices. You can operate with less people, sell as much as ever, and profit more. If no hulk D on open, get the dip and snag some cheap calls and get ready for earnings. Give me a kiosk at the corporate office and let it tell the next prospective vendor what they need to get a deal done.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:05:41'] Did they file a WARN Act notification?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:19:51'] April fools.. (I wish )
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:55:20'] It's all too normal that the population is declining, the demand is declining, and so are the storefronts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:10:01'] What would you say... you do here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 06:10:12'] It‚Äôs to the point if you don‚Äôt use the app you can go to Chili‚Äôs for the same price. Crazy. And the drinks in my area are no longer 1.00
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 13:45:27'] I can get 1/4 of grilled chicken, white rice, beans and a roll for less than $8. I'm not going to McDonald's anytime soon
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 14:03:13'] Terrible food and over priced for the quality.  Stopped eating there years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:47:59'] Putting my puts in now.  Gonna make enough to buy me a Wendy's dumpster!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:04:12'] AI is much cheaper than $15/hr
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 17:52:33'] Bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:12:26'] I have no idea why my McDonald's has 35 cars in line and Popeyes and Freddie's across the street are empty inside and out.    Not complaining though
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:44:35'] There‚Äôs always Wendy‚Äôs ‚Ä¶., and the dumpster behind Wendy‚Äôs‚Ä¶., and the Wendy‚Äôs behind the dumpster
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 18:53:40'] Lay offs means that the stock will moon tomorrow

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 19:47:34'] Got to goto Wendy‚Äôs for the tendies!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 19:51:22'] I am surprised. There drive thru always busy?!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:13:35'] Shit I was scared it was Wendy‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I am already in line behind the dumpster, I don‚Äôt like competition
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:18:23'] I remember this exact thing happened in Japan as well. Companies bought land and then build offices/shops and made money and then use that proceeds to buy new land. Time went by and they started putting land as collateral and borrowed more money when things got so easy with low interest rate. And then when ministry of finance tightened lending stds it all came crashing down. People being laid off and companies shutting down offices. Banks started defaulting or failing. The only diff is they didnt had the luxury of BTFP or any swap lines that could help bank stay afloat.Lets see how it all goes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:22:45'] Technically, those useless corporate data pushers can be reassigned to drive-through duty at their local McDonalds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:30:09'] At least Wendy‚Äôs still open for business
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:31:01'] Damn not McGarbage.  They already went up on their value menu prices squeezing us there.  This is a true sign of a recession.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 20:43:00'] Don't most McDonalds restaurants fall under Franchise ownership?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:01:01'] You can save a metric butt ton of money in corporate taxes by moving out of Chicago/Illinois.  It's just a shakedown.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:05:11'] I refuse to eat at McD now.  They charge more for crap food than a sit down restaurant
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:08:36'] Ice cream machine down permanently
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:09:42'] Inside scoop:  in anticipation of being laid off, Ronald McDonald is taking Wendy's calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:12:54'] So the company is still profitable and growing. And cutting staff to do a little striptease for the quarterly stock bump.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:13:29'] THIS IS THE END!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:17:38'] I went to McDonalds for the first time in a few years. 2 Mcdoubles and 2 Hotnspicey it was 15 to 18 dollars. I about spit take. Shits wild and this does not surprise me they are layingoff
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:23:03'] Shit. I was hoping to land one of those do nothing corporate positions one day... Guess I'll be washing lettuce forever now :(
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:33:04'] If they want to save money, start by firing the officers and directors.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:40:11'] Sp500 to 4800
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 21:44:44'] bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 22:14:46'] Maybe with this restructuring, they can make an ice machine division. That can redesign the machine to keep it from breaking all the time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 22:36:24'] Corporate AI bot: The clown is not McPleased with your job performance. Please turn in your McBadge and McParking-Pass to your nearest Wendy's dumpster. Your new assignment will be waiting for you with open zippers *error code #42069* ....arms.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 04:21:01'] How about McDonalds, maybe try selling food that is unadulterated with toxic preservatives. Maybe try selling food that is fit for human consumption. (If you eat McDonald‚Äôs food, you are legit eating poisons that are designed to be addictive). Fresh food is the way, spend your money at farmers markets instead. Eat an orange, eat an apple. Just don‚Äôt give one more $$ to this corporation. Sorry don‚Äôt feel sad McDonald‚Äôs is laying off, I hope they layoff more until they die as a company‚Ä¶ Point is, McDonalds is bad for you, don‚Äôt eat it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 16:51:43'] JPOW is an absolute fucking idiot. He want IMMEDIATE results and if he doesn‚Äôt get them he gets all hawkish n shit. Meanwhile, these major blue chip companies are using this to their advantage to dump thousands of employees because of their autonomous technologies. Think self checkout, McDonald‚Äôs checkout, panara, bk, and others.  Have you been in one recently?? They are NOT needed!!These companies doing this , (fireing thousands), without the backdrop of geezer jpow, would appear racist and discriminatory. This is a perfect scenario for big companies to cut the dead wood

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 10:50:50'] layoffs are good from an investor perspective so the layoff announcement will like result in a rise in stock price. you're probably going to lose money with puts if you're right however and it goes against what the market would naturally anticipate after an announcement like that your puts will print harder than the fed.edit: didn't see you're already out, my comment still stands in case anyone is confused why layoffs are good news.

POST_TEXT: b'The Dot Com bubble burst because the internet and the infrastructure were not ready and capable of supporting the companies going public at a rapid pace.

More information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime. You can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food. Get anything you want, when you want it. If the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place, the bust may never have happened.\n\nA primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 199899 allowing LOTS of startups to open with cheap money/borrowing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:50:44'] >I agree with your assessment of the Dot Com bubble. The primary difference between then and now is that AI is much more developed and widespread than it was during the Dot Com era. Today, companies are better prepared to implement AI into their operations, and there is a greater understanding of how AI can be used to improve efficiency and productivity. As such, I believe that the current "AI boom" is not a bubble, but rather a genuine revolution that will change the way we live and work forever.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 17:55:19'] The nvda bubble is a fucking joke
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 17:36:58'] NVDA is now worth more than AMD, INTC, QCOM, ON, and TXN **combined**.If that doesn't scream bubble, I don't know what does.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:54:24'] Not to worry, NVDA is just getting started. Won‚Äôt stop pumping until it reaches 12T market cap. This is an opportunity of a lifetime to 20x our money. No, I am not sarcastic at all ;)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:56:25'] What a joke ‚Ä¶.NVDA revenues under $25 billion a year‚Ä¶‚Ä¶meanwhile Tesla revenue is $80-100 billion plus‚Ä¶.same thing with Meta revenue is $120 billion plus and they are valued less than NVDA

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:24:25'] The higher it goes, the lower it drops.  It's a massive bubble just like TSLA in late 2021, it can't live with 135 PE and with a higher market cap than the rest of the leading semis combined.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:46:04'] NVDA has a PE ratio of 139. Tesla is 53. Which has the greater risk of not reaching profitability in a JPOW created recession (were CAPEX is going to be cut by 20%)?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:10:38'] Tesla is overpriced and will crash soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:53:04'] Not surprising. AI is the future~
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:58:47'] NVDA is clearly going to overtake Berkshire too because it's such a highly regarded and profitable business. Definitely doesn't follow all the hype pumps across crypto, EV, data centers, and AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:03:17'] I learned why CDO's exist today.. I have heard that word thrown around in plenty of books and people talking. I never actually spent the time to understand what those dumb little letters actually represent.. let me tell you a story!Have you and your friends ever sat around and had a few beers. Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 01:18:07'] The fact the nvidia is larger than intel in market cap ahould show that market cap literally is meaningless. With some companies they are just meme'd to the sky. Intel is enormously more profitable and larger in everyway.Tesla as a company isn't even bigger than airpods by revenue or profit.

In fact, NVDA is forecasted for a small decline for next Q.  It really should be closer to AMD's valuation than Meta/Tesla/Berk..
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 05:58:51'] NVDA is not going to make it out of this bear channel. Too much negative divergence

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 03:44:30'] If you look at the economic outlook for the next year, I can't see the argument that a stock based on consumer buying power will be doing really well.  Will it outperform the market?  Who knows.  Only buy in if you've always longed to own Amazon.  Then only put in half what you think at first, see if it has more downside.  It's not going back up to 180 anytime soon.  Anyway, we mainly trade options around here until we are financially crippled, so take that into consideration.  Nothing I say is financial advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 02:58:00'] It'll be a better buy when it gets even lower. Everyone here is very good at timing the market. Just wait for the signal.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 06:10:13'] You buy now, I will buy your bags when they get too heavy.  But in all seriousness, it is on my watchlist too but only that right now.  The P/E ratio is still too high given our environment right now.  My regards‚Ä¶ to a fellow regard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 10:25:26'] I reckon Walmart will eat their lunch to be honest, laptops will be some of the first to be brought to the pawn store. Something nice about being poor and going to a store where you can shoplift as your shopping

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 08:52:04'] Eh, starting a car manufacturing business was never going to be cheap
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 09:27:02'] Makes sense.Starting a car company is extremely capital intensive to get going, even more so trying to build an EV based one. This is why no one is starting a car company every few years. the Barrier to entry is too huge. That's why Tesla surprised me. No one believed they would make it when they started. Also  why The established car makers won't go out of business anytime soon.But.. on the flip side, when you see them selling 1 car at 80k+ , once they are up and running, their revenues will be 10x higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 08:57:08'] It‚Äôs like starting a new car company and manufacturing cars is an expensive business to get into. Atleast they actually produce something and it‚Äôs a damn fine product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 13:09:01'] By far the best truck I ever drove.

We can't even get parts for automation equipment and full lines have gone from 12 months to 24 months with higher costs. Chip shortages, parts shortages, supply chains all fucked. Great time to ramp up boys!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 20:00:50'] I interviewed with Rivian in 2021 for an IT management position. I have never been in such an unprofessional interview in my entire life. I got through four interviews and interviewed with who would be my boss. If he was representative of what Rivian is, this does not surprise me in any way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 05:05:39'] At least Rivian is an actual business attempting to build a supply chain and factory to produce a physical product. It's  a nice product. Uber is just a booking website. Same for Air B&B. Yes I know thay tried to build a self driving car, but that's not what their initial pitch was. They should have been a $100k investment. They just found suckers to give them money to go in search of a business model that produces a profit.They're still searching.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 14:45:35'] Rivian should have done like Tesla.Produce a small run of high performance $200k delivery sedans for the local Uber Eats and Amazon Flex community.  Then produce a higher volume $120k ice cream truck and carpet delivery work van.Then when they‚Äôre ready to go mass market, they can introduce a low cost $60k soccer mom van.Finally, they can hype up the cyber-van and promise how it will revolutionize mass market parcel hauling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 17:58:08'] Not hard to do considering they are selling their vehicles at a loss.  The more cars they sell, the more money they lose.  At this point, they would see more success by just shutting down their line and waiting for people with preorders at the old price to cancel their order.  They have something like 18 months of preorder to fill and every one of them will be sold for less than the parts are worth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 20:16:28'] Dear OP. Your post and story sounds great. +14% in six days ‚Ä¶ however the amounts that you are working with are small and with amount of time that you spent watching / thinking / looking at it - is just not worth it. 1) increase of 14% over six days is great. And I mean GREAT people waiting year or 2 years for that kind of return. The market is extremely volatile and no one knew Stock earnings, no one new it will drop that low. It was a pure speculation. A gamble that worked out well on your end. You bet as you mention yourself and it played out. This is good for you for today. But it bad for you for tomorrow and a long run perspective because it would get you a false feeling that ‚Äúyou can feel the market‚Äù. When you not. And you will try again and then again and again since you are hooked up already and statistically you would have more fails and more losses then wins. You would increase your operating amount as time goes on and will see really big swings and eventually loose more than you will gain. There are hundreds stories on Reddit how guys though they ‚Äúhave it‚Äù till they dont.2) you are playing with 7k and made 900 in a week. How much time altogether you spent looking thinking analyzing about it. Tomorrow you will loose this money I am sure you will make another ‚Äúbuy low‚Äù move that would not work out. You are asking when to sell so you can buy more ‚Äúwhen it is low again‚Äù This is not a huge amount , you may be better off spending this time and effort on something real, something that would benefit you on a long run. Job, studies, socializing , improving relations with gf, friends, wife, kids. The real life joy worth more then 900$3) if you are asking on a group when to sell a position over $900 bucks pictures me that your fundamentals and your knowledge of matter is uncertain. Clearly You do not know your risk level, and your target / earnings end. There are no goals set and no stops. You are handling money with very wreckless approach. This would never get to a happy end. You need to get way more involved and decisive on your own. You need to clearly understand why you are buying stock, at what price point you will quit and at what price you will sell and be done (selling at modest profits as important as selling to cut the losses).I wish you good luck, please take a look at 1)2)3) it has been thousands of guys burned badly and do not want to see another one bite the dust üòâ
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 06:23:59'] Anyones opinion is much appreciated. I was thinking of selling around 20% profit. I could hold out longer, but I‚Äôm scared considering the macro factors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 07:23:25'] what was your goal when you bought the shares? just a quick hold to flip when the price rebounds a few bucks, if so, close the trade and move onbut if you are looking to stay long the stock (you think its still undervalued), \-  you could buy a put a few bucks out of the money for insurance (this will be worthless if the price continues to rise but if it falls below the strike, you could unload your shares at the strike - i.e. insurance)or you can sell a call a few bucks out of the money and collect the premium from it, this can help to reduce your cost basis on the shares - would only recommend this if you plan to stay long/accumulate best of luck
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 07:36:00'] My opinion:Good news is that it‚Äôs amazon, even if you drop 50% tomorrow, I‚Äôd bet my house that it‚Äôll come back within a couple months since they run the world lol, but that might just be a bit longer of a trade than you‚Äôre hoping forGenerally I think that if it‚Äôs good enough for a screenshot it‚Äôs good enough to sell, but it all depends on your goal of the investment and timeframe you‚Äôre looking for, so if you wanna let it ride I‚Äôd let it ride and feel fine about it, if you‚Äôre happy with a 14% return then take it and run and don‚Äôt look back

If you don‚Äôt mind holding the shares, and also are considering exiting the position, buy 25 more shares so you have 100, then sell an OTM call option at resistance and collect the premium, if it goes higher than the strike you choose,  you‚Äôll have shares called away, and miss out on gains above the strike, but you‚Äôll keep the premium as well as the difference between your cost basis and the strike you sell at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 02:16:47'] Well I'm broke so that's one factor
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 07:36:16'] Amazon, if your timeframe is long enough, is wonderful for LEAPS or shares. I myself own 200 shares at $85 average. We need to see it bounce off this in the next month or so, otherwise we burn through it. The fact that it‚Äôs already hit it‚Äôs COVID levels makes me bullish on this stock long term, however the market is still due to correct more. Namely Apple and MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 14:00:42'] *Since we still have a strong labour market why would people think online sales would go down?*Stock markets are forward looking.Consumers will keep buying stuff, till they do not. The market is simply pricing the probability of this in. The direction of most stocks seems to indicate that they're going to slow down buying stuff, as compared to a 12-18 months ago.Online sales are a big component of Amazon's revenue, but a huge part of their valuation also comes from AWS growth.Salesforce Just laid of 8000 people. They're forecasting lower growth in the cloud computing and SaaS Space. AMZN themselves are planning on laying off 18K workers. This will help their bottom line, but not necessarily their growth rate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 02:12:29'] >I am not buying Amazon at these prices because I think the stock is overvalued. The company's fundamentals do not justify its current valuation.I believe Amazon will continue to grow in the long term, but I do not think it will be able to maintain its current growth rate indefinitely. At some point, the law of large numbers will catch up with Amazon and its growth will slow down.

Which was primarily used for stock investments.  If you do a chatgpt search fir a question versus a simple google search, they are both satisfactory.  But the difference is that the query only costs Google $0.006.  I predict that AI will be more useful to certain professions as a tool or verification step as this is where each query would be worth more than $0.50 per query.  AI can‚Äôt create original content.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey everyone,.\n\nI want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.\n\nI'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:42:40'] All these companies ramped up hiring during the last couple years. It was inevitable that once the music slowed down these layoffs were coming. Expect companies that were paying high dollar amounts for talent to begin to cull those ranks too
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:39:59'] Not sure how "huge" this really is. Amazon employs over a million people. 10K is a rounding error for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:35:30'] >The layoffs are definitely a deflationary event, and they will have ripple effects throughout the economy. The problem is that when companies lay off workers, those workers then have less money to spend, which reduces demand for goods and services overall. This can lead to price decreases (deflation) and further job losses as businesses struggle to cope with reduced demand. So it's really a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break out of once it starts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:51:10'] The fact is AMZN way overhired in the first place, and they absolutely knew at the time they were overhiring. When I was working for them, they had a shitload of new hires every week, AND at the same time, they were encouraging people to leave. Bunch of fucking dumbasses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 19:14:28'] As more people lose their jobs and income, they spend less and companies‚Äô profits fall. And, seeing this employees will become more cautious fearing getting laid off themselves and focus more on saving than spending. This causes companies‚Äô profits to fall more, which causes more layoffs and becomes a self enforcing cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 20:12:22'] 3% layoffs. Same as twitter and meta yeah. Man this place is bad with numbers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:47:12'] They have to do it now otherwise not good looks or good for the employee to fire too close to holidays.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 19:15:04'] Amazon calls baby
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 19:48:28'] It's like 1% of their work force....
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 20:47:47'] Nothing, it's a correction.Tech companies waaaaaaaaaaaaay overhired and now they're laying off a very small percentage of people (as a whole) and those people are just getting work the next week elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:48:13'] I think the biggest immediate takeaway is that Amazon is probably expecting a poor holiday season and lower revenue growth going forward.  So far it seems like most of the layoffs have been in tech which probably isn't a huge deal (unless you work in tech) and isn't really surprising given how fast tech wages/benefits have been increasing over the last couple years.  Once the layoffs spill over into other sectors I would be concerned and I suspect this will be coming very soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:36:19'] Means we're in a fking recession regardless of what the government says or thinks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:40:41'] I think the government starts calling the economy in recession when minimum wage earning workers start getting laid off. Surely, these mass layoffs will have a domino effect. With less income, the demand for goods will reduce due to which all kinds of businesses will suffer. There will be demand for necessities only.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 19:11:51'] The layoffs appear to be in devices (growth area), retail (baggage) and HR. These cuts are all very typical cuts for a company during the earlier stages of a recession. Typically companies will cut HR because it doesn't generate profits, positions in underperforming areas (retail for Amazon) and growth areas because they expect reduced growth over the next several years.Overall it's just another indicator that we are in or entering a recession, keep in mind that unemployment increases are typically a lagging indicator.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 19:59:30'] Credit card defaults, ramp in auto repossessions   and finally home foreclosures. 2008 all over again. Only this time home owners who way over paid holding the bag instead of banks.  Wait till all the single family investment properties start dropping.  Whew it's gonna be huge this time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 20:14:24'] The CEO is there for one reason only. To know when the music is about to stop. Andy Jassy can only hear silence now
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 20:24:29'] It's a sign the FED want to see to first slow the pace of rate hikes then leave it unchanged then finally start to ramp it down. It means the US economy is cooling off. More unemployed and stagnating salary costs for the employed means they won't go on a spending frenzy, which means the prices won't go up as there are less people who can afford them. This is like the very core of the FED's fight against inflation, the art is not to destroy the economy while fighting it (the so-called soft landing). This is the inevitable price to pay not to suffer more. Actually this is a good macroeconomic sign heading into the next year. Ofc not so much if you personally are getting unemployed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 21:48:55'] It means we're cleared for approach on JPow's soft landing. Everything could be fine, or we could be minutes from disintegrating in a ball of flaming wreckage and jet fuel, metaphorically.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 23:54:40'] Wait to see how unemployment reports and open job opportunities trend. If you see initial claims rise, and less open spots of employment then ok... But as of right now. Hard to tell. Definitely gonna cut the workforce down but not sure by how much yet. Could be wrong but I think the fed said they wanted a softer labor market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 04:53:29'] Most tech companies doubled their employees in the last 2 years..  most are bloated so it's simple right sizing..... what it means in macro picture?  Absolutely nothing
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 05:53:49'] Nothing. All of these companies way overhired warm bodies the last few years and it‚Äôs rebalancing. People need to go back to their service jobs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 08:59:18'] Looks like it has at least 3x the interior volume of a sprinter van and cheaper operating costs. Wonder how the size compares to a big UPS/FedEx delivery truck
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 07:59:08'] Saw a couple of Rivian Amazon delivery vans in Murrieta, California yesterday. Residential city 80 miles from LA where Amazon was testing Rivian vans, I wonder if the test has been expanded or if more vans have been delivered already(10k by 2022 target).The vans look derpy, but also looks neighborhood friendly and more practical for stop-go package delivery. Low floor height, big roll up door, cheap tires and wheels, good front visibility, similar overall shape to euro vans.I want one for vanlife lol! Supposedly available to other customers by 2023 if they can figure out supply chain maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 09:03:09'] These things are going to be a game changer. Everyone hating is going to miss out big time. These things are POWERFUL and have HUGE battery packs. Probably the best delivery vans ever made for production.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 12:26:42'] They look less derpy than the hideous usps vans that aren't even going to be electrified.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 13:47:57'] I don't get the hate, these look badass and super functional.  This is exactly what I want to be in to navigate the wasteland.  Get a big solar panel charging network and you can be almost completely off the grid.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 10:09:18'] Knowing Amazon, they probably had it designed to accommodate the contract delivery person sleeping in it after a shift since they most likely won't pay them enough to afford housing. I guess you could say it was "well thought out".

I see well meaning content creators moving from YT to rumble and odyssey, and really trashing YT while doing it. This will help end YT‚Äôs seeming hegemony in the sector. It‚Äôs not like people have to rip cables out of their house to use something other than YT. A different, in some ways better platform is just key strokes away. YT puts a mental straitjacket on all its creators and makes certain one‚Äôs more restrictive that the others based on vague or openly BS reasons. And what are people doing about this? Some are outright leaving or putting more content on sites other than YT‚Ä¶. YT is feeding Rumble new creators and users by driving them away. YT is a big place and there will always be traffic on it. Other streaming sites will slowly take a portion of the traffic bc YT is too much of a whiny hall monitor now and not enough like the cool film teacher that showed the best movies in film club after school was over.  üöÄ üåô ü¶ç üí™

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:34:35'] This guy's bags appear to be extremely heavy based on the length of his DD.  I made $5k shorting RUM from $15.12 on 9/20/22 to $12.74 on 10/5/22.  RUM is a POS website for a tiny sliver of the internet who have some bewildering issue with YouTube.  Mostly conspiracists who pray that Elon Musk will one day buy this crappy website. Also, this is a de-SPAC, which again tells you the stock is a farce.  Currently overvalued at $9.30/share as this is 65 times 2022 revenue!  The share price should be somewhere between $7 and zero.  If RUM goes above $15 again, I will short it again for an extra margin of safety. BTW, I just went on that website, clicked a video and got this: " 500 Service Unavailable ".  Great website guys

A couple years ago that all changed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 18:59:53'] Too early for the big short 2.5, aren‚Äôt tech typically the last to fall? Wait for 4-5 more months, 425+ SPY, rate cuts and the talk of soft landing successful, thats when you know the rug will be pulled and we come crashing down into the next recession.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 15:26:32'] You know, I was very bullish on the small caps today. I knew a strong day on the IWM was on play. So I should have been looking for strong stocks that held up the spy drop. However, I selected the wrong stock, $UBER instead of the one actually ripping on the day $AI. This loss was on me for not paying attention to the daily chart.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apples returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isnt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. \n\nAs the worlds leading consumer products and technology company, Apples earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? \n\nHeres what analysts think:\n\n* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)\n\n* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv\n\nRevenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

So watch for the indices, I expect the real reaction to be there.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 12:08:24'] Yup. That‚Äôs how stocks work. All of your valuation tools are useless astrology.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 21:00:12'] I'm not justifying the valuation as I am in no way an expert. I am however somone who has worked in several industries that Tesla is touching on which might help shed some light on the larger than normal valuation.1. Solar city: Tesla owns one of the largest manufacturer, deployers, and owners of solar in the US, a market that is universally considered to be hugely important for energy generation going forward.2. Storage: Tesla produces more quality batteries than any single company in the world. Storage (batteries) is the single largest limiter to renewable energy, energy resilience, and in many cases human exploration of the unknown.3. Charging: Tesla has the largest deployment of chargers in the US. It's important to think of these chargers like owning a gas station.4. Mobility: Tesla has some of the strongest autonomous Mobility tech out there, which is increasingly becoming more of a tool to alleviate congestion and make car ownership obsoleteAll that to say, Tesla is not being valued as a car company. They are being valued as car company, a energy distribution company, a green energy company, an a electron storage company, and an autonomous vehicle company all at the same time.While a traditional manufacturer may produce more profit, or more cars. They don't also own the gas stations, they don't own oil refinery making the gas, and they don't own the guy driving the uber around.Tesla valuation is predicated on them owning the entire supply chain of electrons, and leveraging autonomous technology to eliminate the need for dealership and drivers. Now is that likely? I don't know. But it certainly makes Tesla more than just a car company.Just my 2 cents.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 11:50:26'] As I‚Äôve said before in this sub - the value of something isn‚Äôt tangible. The value of something is how much enough people are willing to pay for it.If you learn that then you can become an extremely successful trader putting skepticism to the side.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 21:12:58'] I agree with your statement that Tesla is overvalued at this point, and many times so. Your criticism about Tesla is oversimplified though. Tesla is valued not as a car company but rather as a technology company. In fact, Tesla's strategy of vertical integration (manufacturing lot of things in house) gives them that much margin like you said 30% it is not about using less quality products, it is about vertical integration and innovative super efficient manufacturing techniques. Also, the less amount of parts you can use in a car the more margin you will have. Battery technology is the most expensive component in EVs. EVs require less number of parts than ICE vehicles. I think Tesla is priced not only as a car manufacturer but also as a technology and energy company combined. Tesla's energy business will be as big as it's automotive business in few years. Are you saying Tesla is not making any profit? If so, please go see their last quarterly report. With massive manufacturing ramp up in existing factories  and new factories like in Germany and Texas and the future new factories Tesla will dominate the industry in coming years. I agree one again it is over priced now.

With new factories coming online with new technologies (single casting and 4680 battery with structural battery pack) that roic will go up to around 40%, in 5-10 yearsThat means TSLA has a return on investment in the range of tech companies like apple. BUT the adressable market by TSLA is 10 time larger than the  smart phone market.And that is only the car business.That is why tesla will be bigger than apple by a wide margin.

Discount 15% per year and the **fair value of Tesla now is $2100**. If you believe Tesla can achieve these numbers (number of cars, ASP, profit margin), you should not be surprised at the current price of Tesla.Btw:Walmart profit last quarter: $4.3b  Toyota profit last quarter: $7.8b  Tesla profit last quarter: $1.6b  Tesla will catch up soon with the others and is growing much faster so logically it is valued higher.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 14:29:36'] Tesla has insane margins on their EVs and its clear that those margins are growing. The competition needs to sell 3+ EVs for every 1 that Tesla sells. And on top of that, Tesla produces cars in 1/3rd the time. Also Tesla has car sales back logged for 6 months!And a simple youtube search of FSD 10.3 shows dozens of reviews and drives of the general public. Meanwhile the competition only reveals company videos of their absolute best drives.How about autonomous distribution?How many self driving cars can the competition roll out to with these geofenced cars that need lidar and radar? Compare that to Tesla, which can push an over the air update and sell FSD to millions in an instant.People keep calling Tesla just a car company, but what other car company is the: Majority part supplier, dealership, fuel provider, insurance provider, microchip maker, AI developer, software developer.

I like Tesla, I really do.  I got Tesla solar panels on my roof this year and my brother bought a Model S.  I've been bullish on Tesla since 2010-2011 when I first stepped into a showroom and saw the car frame and motors, and then sat in the car.  But, I just have trouble seeing it valued at over three times Toyota.  I know that there is a huge lack of fundamentals these days with regards to valuation of companies, but this is a bit absurd.  By the way, it took 9 months for them to get approval for me to turn on my solar panels!  France is known for not being very service oriented, but Tesla makes France look like Germany.

Ok, Panasonic is the world's largest battery producer, and its market cap is only $30bn. Tesla retards: but Tesla is a tech company, you can't compare them to other manufacturing companies. Ok, let's take a company like apple, which is a tech company, and compare it to tesla. Apple has an earnings per share of $5.61. With each share worth $150. A revenue per share of $21.69. A book value per share of $3.84. Tesla has earnings per share of $0.64 with a revenue per share of $29.21 and a book value per share of $26.95. But the share price is $1172.

In reality they are mostly decoupled. Blockbuster Video actually made more profits than Netflix‚Ä¶ this didn‚Äôt prevent its stock from collapsing.A good way of thinking of stocks is that they‚Äôre merch and that companies function like sports teams. As long as the team has fans they will sell merch. A team doesn‚Äôt need to be successful to have fans, but a team without fans can‚Äôt be successful.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello there, \n\nIm gonna try keep this short and sweet for all you highly regarded folk. Theres a lithium mining/battery recycling stock going by the ticker $ABML, which just recently hit the $500 million market cap ($547 million to be precise) meaning the stock can now be spoken about on WSB. \n\nI may be a little special and Im quite baked rn but Im going to try lay out for why I think this stock is a potential 10X stock and why you dont want to miss this opportunity. \n\nFirstly, the stock is currently up 78% over the last 3 months, largely as a result of its mining flats in Tonopah being assessed by a third party to contain upwards of 15 million tonnes of Lithium. Thats the largest supply of Lithium in the entirety of the USA! A country, which until now has been struggling to source and have any real security of its own affordable battery metals. I believe the Biden administration has been looking into ways to sure up Americas battery metal supply chains, as importing it is costl'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:42:14'] I'm liking the recent trends of ABML.  It's got coordinated efforts with BASF, $57 million grant, is hiring managers direct from Tesla it seems, construction almost finished on pilot plant, etc, etc, and now rights to this enormous confirmed lithium mining resource.  But what about revenue?  Operations are about to begin in a few months, but for a penny stock this has some promise.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 09:14:45'] >Quote form the report :  [Technical Report Summary for the Topopah Flats Lithium Project Esmeralsda and Nye Counties, Nevada, USA (americanbatterytechnology.com)](https://americanbatterytechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/ABTC-TonopahFlats_InferredResourceReport_SK1300.pdf)  >  >ABTC commenced drilling at the Tonopah Flats property in December of 2021. A total of 12,000 feet  were drilled in 10 reverse-circulation (‚ÄúRC‚Äù) holes and 12 air core holes during two phases of drilling prior  to October of 2022. Drillholes were spaced approximately 200 feet to 3,500 feet apart. **All holes were  drilled vertically and ranged from 400 to 885 feet in depth. Lithium mineralization was encountered in all  21 drillholes submitted for analysis.** And>The Tonopah Flats deposit is comprised of lithium-rich sedimentary claystone with negligible work index and abrasion, and readily disaggregates when suspended in water. Standard assaying of head grades was performed using a representative array of samples selected from 21 drillholes. For metallurgical leaching trials, bulk samples from the Tonopah Flats lithium project were prepared for lithium leach trials using roughly 700 pounds of cuttings from the 2021-2022 drillhole program. These metallurgical leaching trial samples were collected from drillhole TF-2208 where **the average head-grade for lithium was found to be about 790 ppm**.  >  >The sample was homogenized by cone-and-quarter methods and pulverized to 100 mesh to obtain a statistically repetitive sample. Mineral processing was carried out at the University of Nevada, Reno‚Äôs Ore Dressing Laboratory. The claystone is responsive to dilute acid leaching under agitation as well as several methods of selective lithium leaching. **Leaching trials were carried out in-house by ABTC using statistically representative homogenized bulk samples, and these trials demonstrated that over 90% of lithium can be leached from the claystone within a few hours.** Following leaching, treatment of the pregnant leaching solution by pH adjustment/neutralization, filtration, solution purification, concentration, conversion, and final solution polishing/crystallization, or battery grade lithium hydroxide monohydrate can be realized. To be consistent with similar projects, the resources in this report are tabulated in lithium carbonate equivalent (‚ÄúLCE‚Äù).I really recommend anyone interested to read the report. It highlights the potential of the company and the significance of the Tonopah Flat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:49:05'] If I just discovered in sitting on a $1.25 trillion company, the last thing I'm doing is selling it
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:43:00'] Let's be realistic, the stock is probably going to go up from day traders and pumpers, then it will probably go back down (this would be the 4th time). Then continue to bounce around a little while we wait on news from what I believe to be a very intelligent and hard working CEO. Does not mean this company is a scam, but we also don't know that it's not. I bought before the last run-up, held through it, held through the lows, and will hold through the lows after this pump because there is some interesting long term potential. That said I have kept my position small because I understand there is huge risk here, but also massive possible upside. The reality is everyone here that is sure they know where it will go has no idea where it will go.Who was it who said "the degree to which you think you know what will happen is equal to the degree by which you will fail."I'm a $1.135 "bagholder" who won't be selling, or increasing for now. That said, if we go on a run I will certainly trade it to reduce my cost basis. One small note... nobody seems to be mentioning... there is a lot of bullish sentiment because of the government grants, but are we forgetting about Solyndra, etc. On a more positive note, there is a huge interest in moving supply chains for raw materials to the US from what is now largely sourced outside the country. Whenever the govt decides something is important, a lot of red tape can be very quickly cut to pieces. My 2 cents. Good luck to everyone on both sides of the argument.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:03:36'] The best part is that central Nevada is literal wasteland so no matter how environmentally unfriendly the lithium is mined it'll still be a wasteland.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:18:11'] Doesn‚Äôt lithium mining require significant amounts of water?  I saw an article with photos of a lithium mine that had like 30 evaporation basins that took one year to concentrate the dissolved lithium to a recoverable level‚Ä¶ unless these guys plan to use a different extraction method (like reverse osmosis, etc) water availability in the Nevada desert may limit scale up to commercial production.  Should be a great spot for open pool evaporation though!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:54:34'] The company is 1/50th what Elon paid for Twitter, he should buy it before someone else does.Its also important to note that the Lithium is on public land managed by the BLM who can be pretty schizo about when and how mining is done, and can be heavily influenced by the local county, or whatever wildlife lives there or native plant species, if grazing is happening on any of that land then dont expect it to be mined, local politicians and populations always choose grazing over other uses. so just because they have all the mining rights doesnt mean they will ever be allowed to just mine as much as they want,

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 05:39:05'] Geologist here, they may have a lot of lithium but the grade is very low. 560 ppm vs 2200 ppm for Thacker Pass. Looks like a decent strip ratio so the economics on this may not end up being that great.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 04:00:43'] When it comes to mining..... It's all about the concentration.   Period.This defines how hard it's going to be to recover material.  The easiest to exploit..low cost sources are already in production.   Everything else is higher cost and years away. 8-10 years to bring a new source online and begin production, get qualified, and ship to customers.People who overlook how difficult it is are the ones who are going to be left holding the bag. There's a lot of fools out there....Musk is one. Yeah... Remember he was going to produce lithium from clay and salt waterI could tell you about a lithium company that also produces bromine. $5 million $/day in gold in brine passing thru bromine plants... That's almost 1 trillion $ per year.....not economical to extract.  Its all about concentration.When you see the words "pilot plant".. it means nobody knows how to do this or if it will work..... Producing battery grade material which is high purity is not..that easy... A process must be tailored to the impurities.There's gold in seawater... Why arent  you down at the beach getting yours

That's 72 years to fully extract it. Current spot rate is 52k, pre-pandemic (17-20) it sat between 15-30k. Extraction costs are at 5k/ton, but they're using a novel extraction process so there's a lot of variability.Combine that with the fact it was pumped and dumped in 2021, there's too many people bagholding to see a moonshot.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 14:22:44'] The Tonopah area is swarming with Lithium miners right now. American Lithium has a 10M ton lithium claim plus has secured water rights for the area to supply future refining processes. Blackrock Silver Corp is next door with another large claim (peak samples around 1200ppm). Silver Peak Lithium mine, just south of Tonopah, has produced 300M tons of lithium ore since the 60's. There are at least a half dozen more lithium start ups in the area.All of them have the same advantages, close the infrastructure, near the Tesla factory. I don't see how American Battery is a standout from this crowd. They are years away from producing any lithium, while other companies are much further along in their economic feasibility studies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 20:47:30'] Hmmm - there is something to be said about that, because data does have a cost, but there so much cost to compute so it not sure it will bring meaningful roi at the early stages. I think they think their ad revenue generation sucks because of Reddit bits and trying to make up for it
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:16'] So an data aggregator social site that doesn't pay for any of the content it allows on here wants to charge AI companies to scrape the same data. They really don't have a means of making money, this is going to tank when it IPO's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:25'] No wonder the google CEO is now saying their A.I. is doing stuff it wasn't trained to do. It's like hey lets teach our A.I. to learn off of some message board. What could go wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 09:21:33'] I am a huge proponent of returning to the office across the board.  If your job doesn't require constant travel, there is no reason you can't be in the office.  I would argue the large majority of people are far more productive when forced to exit their homes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 23:03:04'] Some of these comments are funny, or ridiculous. I don't think there are any managers or C-level people that give a sh-t whether the current employees get to do something they couldn't do when they were younger. That is just stupid. No one cares about keeping anyone down. That's tinfoil hat sh-t.Some management believe that people are less collaborative,  less productive, less creative and less connected to the other employees if you are working from home.  Some of that is true. They don't want products designed and built by people sitting in their pajamas who haven't showered in a week. If you really think about it, the danger may be overblown, however the concern is reasonable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 04:42:40'] The tech companies hired a ton of people, paid them exorbitant salaries, provided tons of perks, and dealt with a pandemic for which they continue to cater to everyone working from home.

We have to constantly communicate with our co workers. Be it pair programming or whiteboard sessions‚Ä¶ spontaneous chats about solutions because someone had an idea. And the feeling of actually being a team solving a problem.Since we went remote this is all gone. This type of communication just cannot be replaced by online tools. The team is becoming more and more individuals doing there thing. Solutions are worse. The creativity is gone. The team feeling is gone. It just sucks.Yeah I don‚Äôt need to drive to work for 30 mins but at what cost?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 04:50:21'] Human beings need face to face interaction. Also, most studies saying workers are more productive when they work from home are looking at the entire work from home population and not individual people most of the time. There‚Äôs likely a 10% of work from home workers who are insanely productive and the rest are either lazy, don‚Äôt do anything at all, or work multiple jobs against their employer‚Äôs wishes. Also personal anecdotes stating why work from home is better are not objective in any way. I like stocks with in person workers at least on a hybrid schedule in all honesty.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 23:37:00'] I'll start by saying I think 95% of people work less from home when it is on a permanent basis.But anyway, If you advocate remote work as more productive ask yourself what is the meaning of this in a global world? tax breaks on buildings? this is why you think yhey bring you back, are you an idiot? its the lost of cohesion, communication, etc. If there are no benefits to local workers the meaning is the transfer of your position to somewhere with lower wages.

So my wife works in Columbus, but we live in the suburb of Gahanna.  Every day she works from home, her city income taxes go to Gahanna, not Columbus.Many businesses got subsidies on their property tax because the local city was counting on this income tax to make up for it.  We have had many companies move from one suburb to another strictly based on these tax incentive setups.Remote work is shredding the plans that were made.  My wife and I have already discussed moving out of the city because she can remote work 4 out of 5 days.  Just as soon as my high schoolers graduate we might do that very thing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 15:36:15'] It is clear that Amazon (AMZN) continues to be a dominant force in the e-commerce space, as evidenced by its strong fourth quarter results. The company reported revenue of $109.82 billion, up from $87.44 billion in the same quarter last year. This was driven by continued growth in its core businesses, such as cloud computing and advertising. However, it also saw strong growth in other areas, such as its Prime membership program and Whole Foods grocery business. Given this impressive performance, it is no surprise that the stock has been on a tear lately, rising 12.70% over the past month alone.

A clear mind allows you to trade better so I took the thump.Since then I've added catalyst pharmaceuticals at approximately $17.50 a share, and I've added enphase energy at $315.02 a share. Overall my little portfolio is now leveraged at 1.15-1.30 and it has a total of 15400 that I put in. I'm up approximately 1400 bucks.

The company has been struggling due to a number of factors, including a slumping economy and rising interest rates. It is unclear if Amazon has bottomed out yet, but the stock is certainly having a rough year.

POST_TEXT: b"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\n\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run "

We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regards opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.\n\nSo Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:01:03'] >C3 has made significant strides in expanding into healthcare,  manufacturing, and financial services, proving its ability to penetrate  new markets and adapt to different industry needs. This diversification  not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single  sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.Let's be real here, if you really thought AI had potential for growth in those areas, you would be loaded to the tits with calls on Philips for the first two areas you mention.  Everyone thinks they can work their AI magic on healthcare data (cough IBM's Watson cough), but when they get into the nitty gritty of it there are tons of challenges applying those models that they never imagined.  The data usually isn't even stationary, a pretty fundamental assumption for vast majority of techniques used for AI.  Performance will look good on carefully curated training and test data, but moving it into the real world with new incoming data is a different beast.  At least those that have worked in the healthcare field for a long time like Philips, know the challenges and what they're getting into.  Companies like C3 have a high likelihood to simply fall on their faces.  I don't need Kerrisdale to tell me C3 is puffed up and neither should you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 03:23:47'] While you covered the receivables question a little, wasn't there another question about how they changed the revenue and pricing models recently?It is my understanding that this change in pricing makes it harder to understand changes to the financials on a year vs year basis.That is probably very important to understand and to think through those dynamics and how that might influence the receivables balance.My concern would be revenue quality as it relates to the growing receivables balance. Partially impacted by changes in the pricing model. And leading to declining revenues over time at some clients.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 06:43:33'] A little of column A, a little of column B.What is your take on the section of the short report that involved current/former customers/employees that essentially say "their shit doesn't work"? I get the impression that [c3.ai](https://c3.ai)'s product is some janky-ass shit. It sounds like something out of the Phoenix project. They have a few customers where it works well, but those have been customers for years, and it sounds like they have a lot of challenges around adapting that to new customers.The points about "AI taking over the world" are null. [c3.ai](https://c3.ai) is AI, not "AI". It's what companies have been doing for years around big data and ML, just wrapped in some buzzwords that the general public is becoming aware of. I thought their comments about C3's moat were kind of spot-on. Amazon, Google, Snowflake, Palantir, etc do "AI" better than C3, and probably do AI better than C3. C3's competitive advantage seems to be in their ability to work with bespoke clusterfucks of data, which the others don't want to touch. Not worth the effort.None of this was news to me (except the reports that their shit over-promises, under delivers, and drags out a services contract to deliver nothing), but the numbers pointed to it working. Those numbers are now in doubt.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 15:21:32'] VErSES AI ($VRSSF) is quickly becoming the [best C3 Ai Stock alternative](https://www.realcreativeagency.com/blog/what-is-the-best-c3-ai-stock-alternative/?reddi-c3-ai).Here's how their AI solution compares to C3's.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/omkenfkno5va1.jpeg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c8683286e079667a44f321b3832a0ebba698ce0b
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:00:13'] Good fundamental analysis, but you failed to answer the questions of accounting fraud that Kerrisdale laid out. Baker Hughes ballooned unbilled receivables (99% gross margins).... CFO changes.. intentionally misleading financial language.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:50:13'] I had the same instinctual reaction as you OP. I'm providing upvotes (for whatever that's worth) for trying to wrangle with this group. Your analysis is cogent and logical. I do wish C3 would come out swinging instead of bowing down and taking it up the cornhole. That reaction does not inspire confidence, but I get that they're trying to be prudent. I'm long AI. For anyone short AI and not providing any real evidence as to why you can suck my dick, suck my dick, and suck my dick.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 03:31:54'] Great work, This is a disrupter company with great IP.Someone is on the hook for a big short , don't forget it Iped at 150 was shorted down to 9 dollar's approx.Someone trying to buy it on cheap?Kerrisdale Capital and rest of US hede funds are draining the market.They need to stop shorting until a block chain market is in place.Fraud is rife with parasite hedge funds crippled with debt .If this continues overseas buyers like me will take flight.Buy more C3 ai !
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 04:29:28'] I agree on most of your points. Their letter is totally dumb except the point of high turn over rate of the CFO. Is there something really going on that the CFO have to keep quitting? I did check out Glassdoor and it seems like the CEO is an old fashion guy who is hard to work with. That might be one of a reason but there might be something else. I‚Äôm long C3 btw so this do concern me as well

I saw it spiked from $20 to $30 and crashed back to $20 again. Anyone playing the next leg up on this AI meme bubble? I see 50% downside, and 500% upside, in the short run.

So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.\n\nIt was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.\n\nWhy, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos baby.\n\nSo, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $M"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 19:25:33'] I liked how Bitcoin started to rally about an hour or so before the market close, signaling a bullish rebound to come as the price of risky assets started to go up. I started a position on $MARA $10 calls and looking to add to my position tomorrow along with some $TSLA and $AI calls for the week. Looking bullish tomorrow, but we will see.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 14:34:52'] Finally, some bearish signs and the break of theta gang. The past month was really boring. Still, I dont believe there will be any rate hike pause. Since 1. American saving rates are up 2. Job market is still strong and 3. Signs of stubborn inflation still persists.Overall, just glad to see some of my puts start to print. Looking at MSFT and GOOGLE, I guess some of the money I will hand it back to bulls. Overall, the trend finally starts to go to the bears side which I am more than happy of. Hope you had some fun with your family on your field day

However, the market-projected Fed rate path still suggests a 1% rate cut within the year and another 1.2% cut next year, which creates a large gap between market expectations and the Fed schedule, greatly affecting stock valuations (more details in the next section). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdiipbvxrova1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=235c5b91e978482e15656c833868ab827c0c88c0\n\nOn the inflation front, this weeks data is a mixed bag; overall, things are cooling, but there are some warning signs that the disinflation process may not be a smooth ride.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 17:48:43'] Great recap!Forward P/E with the current downside risk isn't a good indicator imo. Equities are expensive but the concentration into certain stocks is probably where the risk is and why markets might fall in the near-term.Positioning probably doesn't let the market fall too much without a credit event, so I agree earning theta is the way. I see big sector rotations coming depending on how the big names report this week.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:41:31'] I just recently finished an amazon warehouse and am aware of how many additional facilities amazon will be opening in the next 2 years that are already paid for and financed, and will sit unused for 2-5 years before even being used. I'm long on amazon. They have so much money they don't know what to do with it, so will begin buying back shares. Anyone who thinks the results just released are a sign that amazon is floundering, is an idiot.

The one that really gets smashed during the next recession is Tesla. Who's going to buy all those $70,000 Teslas if money is tight? Now imagine Tesla's growth slows or even goes negative during the next downturn... that will be a bloodbath.Because Tesla is priced for never-ending growth. Good luck, Tesla bag holders.

Author Stephanie Bonvicini claims that the luxury baggage company had a store in Vichy on the ground floor of the Hotel du Parc, in which Marshall Philippe Petain based his puppet government. Henry Vuitton, great-grandson of the firm's founder Louis, apparently set up a factory making artifacts to glorify Petain. Bonvincini's book, Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, which is published by Fayard, was written to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the fashion house, but it does not carry full approval. "We don't deny the facts," an LV spokesman told the Daily Express.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 06:26:14'] Don't take this the wrong way. You are seeking confirmation bias. With that being said, you really shouldn't be trading because you are missing the golden rule of trading, always have an exit strategy.  With the fact that you are not happy with your current profit in these times of uncertainty only sets you up for failure.  FOMO is bullshit and should never cross the minds of a trader. You are here for one thing and one thing only, profit.  There is plenty of money to be made, don't rush it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 09:23:02'] Why choose that much of a long dated call though?  Are you planning on holding it for months and regularly selling weeklies?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 11:31:07'] This seems quite bad to me. If the calls you sold end ITM, you will pay for and lose all the time premium on your long calls because you have to exercise them so far in advance.Why do you think this is a good idea?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 17:30:37'] So you bought the 95 strike long calls when Amazon was somewhere between 99-101?  So you paid the time premium and  ~5/share intrinsic value - and then sold your calls pretty much at the money?  I think your best hope is Amazon dumping about 4 bucks a share tomorrow so you can buy back those short calls.  Of course, I have to bet against you a bit cause I have $60 long calls at the same exp.  I bought back my $107 short calls on the dip and if it pumps this week I‚Äôll be selling them back again but always way farther otm Still rooting for you as much as possible

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 05:20:23'] **GameStop Taps Amazon Executive as Chief Growth Officer, Hires Two Ex-Chewy Execs**> GameStop Corp. said it has tapped Elliott Wilke, an Amazon.com Inc. executive, to be its chief growth officer, effective April 5, and hired two former Chewy Inc. executives. >The hiring comes after the videogame retailer recently added Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen to its board. Mr. Cohen had urged the company to shift away from its bricks-and-mortar centric business model and instead focus on e-commerce and other technology-driven operations. This month, the company's board tapped Mr. Cohen to lead a committee dedicated to transforming the retailer. >Mr. Wilke held various senior roles at Amazon, including in Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry. He will oversee growth strategies and marketing, focusing on customer loyalty and expanding the company's use of customer insights and metrics for marketing, GameStop said Tuesday. >The company said it hired Andrea Wolfe, who previously served as Chewy's vice president of marketing, as vice president of brand development, and Tom Petersen, previously Chewy's vice president of merchandising, for the same role at GameStop, both effective March 29.I‚Äôm also stoked about Andrea Wolfe. The influx of Chewy employees is amazing for their digital e-commerce focus.

POST_TEXT: b"Simple question. I'm trying to discover new companies which might be the next big thing (think alibaba in China for example), can you list a few obscure companies that you think might go big in the future, with your rational.\n\nFor me, Nanostring technologies. $500m mc, reached $4b over the hype last year, they have lots of new technology coming out over the next few years, university's and research institute are starting to adopt their tech as its faster/cheaper than alternative.\n\nEdit: this wasn't meant to be a deepdive or pump on nanostring, rather just show you the kind of stocks I'm talking about. Nanostring is a gene expression profiling company, leader in the field. My research institute uses them a lot, I've also listen to a lot of talks and they've really starting to integrate and release new tech. I like them, you don't have too haha\n\nEdit 2: thought I would list the choose below, to save you time hunting. PLTR, STNE, \n\n\nThoughts?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-18 14:37:06'] If you're looking for the next Amazon/Apple/Google then you're going to have to take a big gamble. These companies essentially kick started their respective fields and then found that edge that kept them blowing up. Amazon brought us the online super store, Apple brought the smart phone, Google exploded with the cloud and Android. Tesla with the luxury Electric Cars. So what field is next?In my opinion the next thing that needs an industry leader is the space sector. Yes there's Space-X, but that's not publicly traded, so who will battle them? For satellites or Low Earth Orbit launches you have Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit, and Astra Space. All 3 have contracts in place with various agencies, government and private. The 2 former have been in the $3.50-$4 range so there's the potential to buy a lot for a low price. Astra has been staying in the $1.25-$1.60 range but they come with more risk due to a few failures, including the loss of NASA satellites in their last launch. This one isn't a very popular opinion here but if you believe that "Space Tourism" has any potential down the road then Virgin Galactic has been trending up. There is a lot of people that are very salty about this stock because they bought at or near the ATH of $55+. It closed today at $7.23 which is almost $3 lower than its IPO. Virgin Galactic hasn't flown since Branson went up, and they've had a lot of delays, but they have a new contract with Boeing, just signed a lease for their final assembly building, and are aiming for 400 flights per year by 2025 which will greatly reduce the cost making the it affordable for the "average" person. Just my 2 cents!

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 14:56:56'] I like this at $7-$8 or will be interesting to see if it bounces of that $9.50 support. I could see BB as ripe for an acquisition, assuming it can continue to penetrate IOT and cyber security and reduce its operating expense by a shit ton, likely would need major downsizing in order to do so as they have like 3500 employees. Looking, I would say kinda,undervalued at $6B when compared to its competitors.EDIT 1: This company has cash flow issues and needs to downsize in all likeliness in order to reduce its operating expense. All of its revenue is getting raped by its operating expense and it‚Äôs revenue is not exactly pouring in either. It‚Äôs also disturbing that it won‚Äôt have enough cash to cover its short term liabilities for next quarter. I would almost expect them to issue shares to try and raise some capital for its current liabilities this would drop share price however. EDIT 2: Earnings don‚Äôt look much better. Projected average 177M revenue, which if hit, will be raped by -87% net profit margin sooooo not gonna help much with cash. EDIT 3: Yes, I know, COVID has crushed hopes and pillaged cash from companies,honestly shoved BB made it. Long term Chen is going to need to stop the bleeding before he can really be aggressive in the software transition strategy‚Ä¶..which is a wise move. Good news is he recently was granted 3M incentive based RSUs so he is def motivated to perform and likely directly motivated to raise SE and the stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 15:59:46'] You have great intentions and a good analysis, but i don't think $BB is really going anywhere on the short / medium term.On your own slides, **the next projection they have is FOR FUCKING 2030** my guy. That's another 8 year development cycle. It's way too long for this stock to skyrocket for now. Their business partner's are currently irrelevant unless they can crack that $TSLA partnership that they've been cooking for a while, but everyone knows Elon thinks BB is just an old company that doesn't fit their current moat.Also, hedge funds are not directly increasing their positions on $BB, they increased 50% quantity to add 20% value... That means they are doing an "average down price" kinda play, to dump it on top of retail. Also, a 25mm position is pretty much nothing. If a few of us guys together here could buy more then the whole position that Morgan Stanley holds, this means Morgan Stanley doesn't hold anything significant in it.This stock has nothing to do with AMD man, AMD makes HARDWARE, and you yourself said that $BB is transitioning away from hardware to software-based solutions. They are not comparable companies or comparable positions at all, totally different companies in totally different situations really. You could perhaps say they looked like GME and it would be a more fair comparison, but, still, it's such a different outlook. GME NEVER had golden days and lost all value, it was a average company that went bad... $BB has had it's golden days and lost a ton of value by bad decisions of company management. They had golden days and burned a lot of bridges down. It's different. Don't do it. At least, not for another 6 years. It's way too long of a bet to enter it now.

POST_TEXT: b'&#x200B;\n\nDo you see any potential in the recent Amazon split and upcoming Google 20:1? Are these Blue Chips, stocks that our dads wished they invested in before the price was to high for the average investor, going to be more attractive now that they are "affordable". I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn\'t mean that they are actually "cheaper" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don\'t have millions to invest. I\'m more inclined to purchase Amazon and Google at $100+ and own "more" whole shares, than spend limited capital on a few or have fractional share (I\'m with TD, so I don\'t have the ability to purchase fractional shares yet.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now my strategy was to purchase Amazon option calls before the split, that expire next Friday (Jun 10), with expectations that the price will go up next week. I also purchased Google calls well in advance anticipating the price will go up in the weeks prior to the split. These calls expire the day'

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 15:13:42'] By doing the 20:1 stock split they might get into the Dow index.The dow uses a weird system based on stock price not market cap as other indexes.Also it makes the stock seem more affordable even though nothing has changed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 12:51:04'] Do you know the reason they are splitting stock when they know their own stock will continue to tank due to how higher interest rates affecting their industry? That's because they want retail to baghold their stock if they make it affordable so the stock impact for their larger shareholders and executives aren't as big. They are spreading their risk to retail investors.Be big brain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 13:32:30'] The value here in my opinion is simply the more affordable path to selling covered calls.  As for options bets, I don't see huge hype around it and given current market trends, the stock isn't pumping regardless, so I wouldn't think there's any reason to think you're going to kill it on buying calls because bums in their parents' basement can suddenly afford a few shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 05:51:03'] The stock split is exciting, but even more exciting for me is the fact that there's more liquidity. This means more institutions can buy the stock. Now it's much easier for the major institutions and other big money to buy AMZN shares. In addition, the Dow may be rebalanced and AMZN is certainly a candidate to enter the Dow. I'm looking forward to Monday, and will continue to buy if there are any dips.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:26:52'] I also laughed/cringed when I first heard that grinder $GRND went public.  However, upon doing some research, it does seem like something potentially brewing in this ticker:1). HUGE insider buys by Raymond Zage (hetero guy who took it public) after it dropped below $62). Incredibly small public float for quite a while 3). Been eerily quiet in terms of PR and near zero chatter on stock interwebs, perhaps planning something 4). Company is actually profitable and somewhat undervalued 5). Average users spend nearly one hour per day on the app5). The LGBTQ factor - are ‚ÄúTHEY‚Äù going to let the first gay stock fail?‚ÄúSPACs are DEAD‚Äù says Cramer and other talking heads, but some low float SPACs with the righ ingredients are still mooning, albeit temporarily, prior to lockup expiration.  I know you guys hate SPACs, but gotta find something with hopes of recuperating losses in this shitty market!

It‚Äôs over with just a small speculation buy.  If it keeps going down I wait for a plateau.  Sometimes that‚Äôs just a 1/2 day flat spot with supportive news of some sort and I do 5-10% more, and so forth.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w2jn95/walmart_is_betting_big_on_electric_fuck_vans_to/'
POST_TEXT: b'Shopping online at Amazon is incredibly easy. Shopping in-store at Wal-Mart is not, which is why Wal-Mart just ordered 4,500 electric fuck buses from Canoo ($GOEV). Canoo designed these vans with two concepts in mind - First, transporting Wal-Marts Chinese goods to American consumers and second, Green Banging. Wal-Mart isnt dumb. They realize the only, and I mean the ONLY way they are going to compete with Amazon is not by improving their almost useless website. No, it will happen by deploying several thousand electrified bang buses across America. \n\nNow, you might be asking yourself - when and where does the green banging come in? Simple. After these things have been decommissioned from delivering Mountain Dew, baby formula and gun ammo to trailer parks across America, Wal-Mart is going to allow its customers to go hog wild and lease these electric vans to be used as full-blown, eco-friendly bang mobiles/meth labs! Theyre the perfect size for hosting a meth-fueled orgy, easily fi'

There are multiple narrow body competitors coming to market in the next few years. Also ignoring what a complete shit show Boeing "leadership" is. The only thing Boeing has going for it is that it is a monopoly in North America, and that's only gonna prop up the stock for so long.Take your short term gains and bail out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 12:53:25'] The long term blue collar money will be in maintenance of all these robots and automated platforms.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 13:02:14'] To Summarise The Article:Walmart has previewed how it plans to use automation to manage inventory, stock shelves and keep up with online orders. The company took investors on a tour of an approximately 1.4 million-square-foot facility in Brooksville, Florida ‚Äî the first automated distribution center for packaged foods and other shelf-stable household items. Walmart plans to add the same automation from Symbotic to all of its 42 regional distribution centers. Walmart‚Äôs automation is a piece of a broader plan to drive profits higher. The company said by the end of January, roughly a third of stores will get distribution from the automated facilities. For Walmart, the automation push means rendering obsolete some of its 1.6 million roles. In three years, Walmart anticipates that about two-thirds of its stores will be serviced by some kind of automation, about 55% of fulfillment center volume will move through automated facilities and that unit cost averages could improve by about 20%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 06:44:01'] Amazon is a shit company with a shit website and shit knockoff and counterfeit products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 05:42:20'] Still valued more than twice the real value imo.  Just look at the raw numbers. In the best possible conditions for them, getting stimulated so hard that Jeff Bezos prostate probably grew to the size of a baseball. And the best they can manage is to hit just under $40 billion in profit. In the coming recession they are probably going to start haemorrhaging money. Even if they manage to maintain 'modest' $10B-$12B in profits, you telling me that a business that makes that kind of money is worth in excess of $1 Trillion?  Ford averages over $10B for the last decade, yet somehow they are only valued at about $50B and Amazon is supposed to be worth $1 Trillion dollars? I am all for pricing in future growth and returns. But does anyone honestly think Amazon is going to grow to 10x let alone 100x their size over the next 20-30 years? Because that is what it would take for their stock price to even make a tiny bit of sense at current values.   But whatever, the bottom must be in, just let me go order a barrel of lube from Amazon before we start the buying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 07:44:16'] Still room for another 25-40%! Puts on Amazon

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 05:06:38'] Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong please.Stock split in early June but the record date is May 27th. This Friday. You will have to own the stock before the record date to split your stock. Pretty sure the split is 20-1
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 05:39:53'] I think it has 1500 more to go. Got to at least, get back to the pre-covid stimulus price. Hopefully not all the way back to before the post-housing crisis stimulus. But, there was a total of $20T of new dollars borrowed and spent by US Gov since ‚Äò09. That means there was also $20T of Tnotes given to the Fed. The Fed now holds $6T, so a total of 20T cash and 14T notes pumped into the global economy. That‚Äôs a lot to pile onto the 10T/10T that was in circulation before ‚Äò09.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 06:34:07'] Absolutely love the bear market!  Going to buy 25 k worh of shared when the shares drop below 2 K and then I am going to be rich!

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 18:09:13'] If this is a long term hold you‚Äôll be fine. Keep buying when it tanks if you had conviction at your purchase price, why not buy more when it‚Äôs on discount.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 14:19:05'] BI is trash. Bezos was responding to a question and said all companies fall. Doesn‚Äôt really mean anything aside from Bezos views the lifespan of all corporations are finite.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 14:26:11'] Bezos is almost single handedly accelerating the collapse of civilization which will occur in 18 years or less. Amazon will not only fail, it will drag everyone down with it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:10:37'] I am not a financial advisor nor any expert in any of these matters, these are just my observations from personal experience with Amazon.Many things are killing Amazon right now:* Pandemic is over, people are not ordering online as much as they were.   * Drop in sales volume here directly affects their bottom line.* Amazon Prime price increase.     * People are not renewing Prime.  That's one loss.    * Add to this people looking to other options for purchases and trying them out as if they don't have Prime anymore is an additional immediate loss in sales.* Amazon has internal operational problems.  Examples:   * I ordered a Plantronics headset, it was shipping in a plastic shipping bag without any bubble wrap.  It should have been shipped in a box.  Headset arrived broken due to poor packing.  Returned for replacement...three times.  Headset broken in shipping total of 4 times all due to improper packaging, did a final return for a refund. Four headsets that sell for 30 bucks each all damaged plus the lost 2 days shipping costs Amazon had to cover for the replacements and the returns shipping and returns processing costs.   * Ordered a computer keyboard for my son for his birthday, arrived broken in shipping, did the return dance for two attempts and gave up for a refund. Three keyboards at 25 bucks each all damaged, same deal in lost product sales and returns shipping costs.   * In total I can say that Amazon has lost close to $500 in product sales they improperly packaged for shipping with just my orders. Add returns shipping costs, replacement shipping costs and the labor costs of having to process those returns and you are definitely in the red.    * A few hundred bucks for one customer doesn't seem like much but when it's hundreds and thousands of customers seeing damaged products due to cost cutting in packing something for shipping, it adds up.  From what I can gather from friends and family across the country, they have seen the same issues over the past 5 to 7 months.* Amazon's anti-union operations.   * This is something that has no way of recovering the costs.     * Spending hundreds of dollars an hour per consultant and actors to stop unions from forming is expensive.  Even if you defeat the union from forming, you can't recover those operational losses in the short term.    * I think someone on r/antiwork did the math and worked it out at one warehouse they spent $400/hour per employee to stop the union.     * If Amazon has given that warehouse worked a $10/hour raise they were asking for, the union would not have formed and they would have saved $390/hour per employee in anti union costs.I am sure that there are other factors affecting their bottom line here but it seems to me that this drop in earnings for Amazon should not have been unexpected. Amazon leadership should be well aware of these issues and if they are not or don't accept the truth here, well, that's another one of Amazon's problems.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-16 20:45:59'] Meh..... intelligent investor isn't even that good. I feel like it is just recommended out of tradition. Graham's metrics would make you miss out on early Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc. etc.  It's just way too conservative. Many stocks don't pay divvies, which would should exclude them according to Graham IIRC.   Much better books for investing are the Four Pillars by Bernstein, Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman, and any b school text book by Damodaran on valuation. That's all you need. After a while, all books sound the same. Buy good valued equities and hold for a long time. That's basically it. For actual personal finance there are no secrets..just invest in well diversified funds and save save save.

Not to mention labor issues, regulatory scrutiny, and a bitch of a COVID hangover.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 14:56:48'] Amazon's stock will trade flat unless they split the company up into separate business units.  They have built many business units that continuously lose money (like grocery) or that failed entirely (like healthcare).  Their retail business has no logical curation and is overwhelmed with Chinese companies selling low-quality goods, resulting in Amazon.com becoming a digital flee market with a home page filled with inaccurate recommendations.  These same 3rd party sellers are upset because Amazon is raising fees, taking over 50% of an item price to pay for logistics & delivery.  Meanwhile Walmart & Target now offer fast delivery with no membership required.  Anyone who is still bullish on Amazon is ignoring all of the problems they need to fix to keep growing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 13:29:30'] BTW, if you are recognizing this broker, I recommend you stay away. First, If you buy 100 contracts and sell 20 of them at a time, then congratulations, you have made 5 day trades, which usually should be considered only one. Second, even if you have over 25k in your account, for what ever reason, they did not give you unlimited day trade. I initially bought 5k worth of contracts. Was going to sell them for a profit. They won't let me. And, what the most stupid thing is they ask you to call them instead of letting you sell and marking you as a day trader. The pump made me furious so I keeps averaging down, I was actually down 5k intra day but at the eod break-even. I was calling them to sell half, but I hang up at the last minute. I say fxxk it.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive been almost fully invested in Amazon for over a year now. I originally bought really high at around 150 before the entire market decided to crash. When it did, I took the opportunity to buy more and so now my avg cost is down to 102. Currently holding about 150 shares.\n\nI want to try and gauge market sentiment on Amazon here by seeing what you all think. Is it going to continue flat around $100? Is it going to surge tomorrow? I have definitely noticed a trend for the last few weeks or even months that it tends to spike up on Wednesday and Thursdays most often. It seems like there is a lot of resistance, presumably from people who dont fully understand the breadth of Amazons offerings, their leading position in ALL retail segments, and the insane investments in automation they have been/are making.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:16:54'] Amazon added 750k workers, out of which about 150k were white collar workers, in 2 years and opened a whole lot of fulfillment facilities. This is a huge drag on their cash flows. They need to cut way more than the 27k they announced to turn things around on cash flow basis. Unless they take steps in that direction or announce new lines of revenue I do not see it turning around. So you might see it in the 90 to 100 zone for some time. If you are in it for the short term, try and exit at close to 110.

Forget forward looking during this period. The market capitulates after the first rate cut. Amazon will probably go to about $60 a share, minimum. Fundamentals are also important. They trade at way too high a P/E.

"Nikola Corp. founder Trevor Milton‚Äôs hype about the electric truck startup‚Äôs prospects lulled a real estate investor into accepting millions of dollars in Nikola stock options as partial payment for a 4,600-acre ranch, he told the jury in Milton‚Äôs criminal fraud trial.""Hicks said he agreed to sell the ranch that June and got $8.5 million in cash and options to purchase 515,095 Nikola shares at a below-market price, which were valued at $15 million when the deal closed in August 2020. That month, the stock was trading at more than $40 a share. But by December, when Hicks was first able to exercise the options, they had plunged to as little as $13.51. That was below the $16.50 strike price on the options, which made them ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù he said."https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-28/nikola-founder-bought-utah-ranch-with-worthless-stock-options

Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: $27.75\nRevenue: $137.4 billion vs $137.6 billion expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nAWS revenue: $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings per share are comparable to analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon is wrapping up a rollercoaster earnings season for mega-cap tech companies. Netflix shares were hammered late last month after a weak subscriber outlook spooked investors. Upbeat earnings from Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet in recent days suggested the season could end on a high note, but then Facebook revealed stagnating user growth, which sent its shares plunging and dragged down other social media stocks.\n\nAmong the top tech companies, Amazon was the worst performer last year, with the s'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:28:29'] As per their earnings:"Net Income increased to $14.3 billion in the fourth quarter, or $23.75 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 billion, or $14.09 per diluted share, in fourth quarter 2020. Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in RIVIAN Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November."&#x200B;I would be careful here, take away that $11.8 billion that is worth 40% less than it was in December because they still hold those shares and their bottom line isn't as good. Also keep in mind that without those unrealized gains their bottom line is more like $2.5 bil. That is a net loss compared to $7.2 bil 2020. This looks a lot more like fudging the numbers to hide their forward guidance miss that is about 5% lower than what the street expected.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 04:40:30'] You know, reading the usual articles from the usual sources, I've come to a conclusion: investors are fighting the FED. That bonkers rally yesterday is a prime example of BTFD in full swing. Money managers spouting off about slowing down rate hikes lest the FED break something (translation: please don't take away the punch bowl, lest we have to actually generate value ourselves!)And then what happens? More bad data comes along, more FED speak pouring cold water on any upside; but each intermediary period is the same stubborn fight back from bulls.I think that's part of what makes bear markets so brutal. Humans' default preference is for line to go up, so when the going's good, most people are happy to pile in and go with the trend. When it's a bear market, there's a lot more push back. But - the macro forces of the market still prevail, it's just a lot choppier getting there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 05:58:54'] It is truly incredible how much our refusal to switch to nuclear energy has fucked us over the last few decades. Look at how our presidents have had to grovel to the Saudi prince basically begging him to give us cheap oil. And look now how they kick us while we are down by cutting oil production and putting Europe into a crisis. Cutting weapons sales to the saudis isn‚Äôt the solution. They‚Äôll just buy them from China instead, it won‚Äôt change anything for us. The solution isn‚Äôt renewables either. It‚Äôll take 50+ years to solve for the incredible inefficiency of renewables (takes 100 barrels of oil to manufacture batteries that hold 1 barrel worth of energy). The solution is and has always been nuclear power.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-05 13:29:14'] The problem with Amazon is you can sell a product with a 10% cut. If it's successful they will adjust the cut to 50% and then release their own version cheaper than the original seller. Just like they are running out of people willing to work for them they will soon run out of people willing to be a seller. I work for Amazon. AWS is the saving grace.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-05 13:48:54'] I work in commercial construction. Amazon put out a call to stop all new work on new buildings. No word when they'll resume. Something is happening.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-05 13:22:07'] CNBC is bad enough, but when they're flat out guessing on top of that...If AMZN has an inventory issue, I'd look for confirmation of that through employees/locations themselves. Bear in mind they serve as a platform for third party sellers, and as people look to unload unused/unwanted stuff to make ends meet in this economy...I can see that being a significant factor. Not AMZN inventories alone. They also process returns (factor in max time frame for returning items).

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming. This GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and i believeAmazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop. So what do they have to do with each other? competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.

I wish my presentation was recorded because I fucking called this back then.If you read their year end reports, you can very quickly see how shady the business is. Long story short, they hand out extremely risky loans, loans that other underwriters generally wouldn‚Äôt make. Then they bundle them together with other various risky loans (hey remember CDOs from the housing collapse?) and then sell them to a financial institution named Bridgecrest.Bridgecrest is owned by drivetime. Drivetime is owned by the father of carvanas CEO. The father plead guilty to loan fraud in the early 90s. Based on my research, it never made sense to me why they were valued so high. Fraud, I guess??

My buddy‚Äôs dad had his car flooded from a creek. All he did was air it out and sold it to Carvana for NADA (JD Power now) retail price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 17:32:22'] Good. Fuck 'em and fuck their investors. At least half the VC world is comprised of fools who buy into ideas like "Business X + mobile app = great new and necessary service" with no thought about whether it was needed, wanted, or has any real good consequence. AUTOMATE EVERYTHING and then use your VC for monopolistic practices.  Just buy everything whether even if you're paying more than what it's worth. Smart. Right until it stops working for any reason. Online car sales was never a good idea. It's not a new product. It's not inventive. It's not even really disruptive, at least not in any positive or sustainable way. Not entrepreneurial. Every time some guy with an "It's the Air BnB of Industry X" sales pitch goes out of business, an angel gets its wings.The worst thing about this is that they're actually likely to scrap a very large percentage of their lowest priced inventory because it's easier than reselling and transporting thousands of cars. If they have to liquidate, there are likely to be more cars to move than people in the industry can even handle efficiently. They can do that and retain some market stability while writing off the loss. A lot of decent low cost cars that middle class people could have bought from local dealers may never reenter the market. Actual valuable equipment destroyed because of misguided tech bros who never should have got into the car business.Find an MBA and a software engineer, give them a massive amount of cash, and watch them think they are instantly captains of industry.

I thought they just facilitated sales, introducing sellers with buyers and taking a cut much like stubhub does for tickets, or like autotrader?Are you saying Carvana has been buying up used cars to sell on their own?If they do have a massive stockpile of unsold used cars, it would make me wonder if they're sitting on enough to be partially responsible for the crazy spike in used car costs ("partially" because obviously the lack of new cars created higher demand for used).
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 07:40:35'] Great company i've known many people that love buying cars from them. Surprised this is the outcome. They did acquire a auction car company, so they could start flipping like givemethevin.com ... Not sure someone like amazon would dive into this space... Maybe a manufacturer from outside of US that wants a US presence to sell their local cars? Chinese car company or something perhaps... They do have a great gimmick and good volume with low overhead. They just got screwed in the high used car buying market post-covid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 07:54:12'] I was looking at buying a car this summer and LOLED at the prices Carvana had. The majority of cars available were bare bones fleet models priced over what the top trim model was elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 13:50:28'] It‚Äôs not gonna crash the used car market with volume; they have like 70k cars in inventory and there are millions of used cars sold in the us each year. So unless it acts as a domino and sets off something else it would just be a drop in the bucket as far as volume.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 13:52:43'] I knew they were in trouble aside from the continual drop in the stock price. I live near I-40 where Carvana has a lot.

Semi-anonymous. Not anon like reddit. Not full here I am like facebook. But unique users linked to Amazon accounts.Then just be cool. Not all attention ho like facebook did to it's algos. Blew it's goodwill. For clicks. But just a high class craigslist feel where you go to hang out after you shop and talk about shit and see cat videos. Could kill it. The major social sites are practically begging to be put out of their misery by this point. Amazon could leverage hard.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:19:32'] I also keep a copy to remind me that Bezos looked like a troll before and now looks slightly less trolly, and it only took hundreds of billions of dollars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:00:19'] Zuckerberg is just trying to recreate Futurama internet
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:52:52'] Man looks better now than 15 years ago‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:20:13'] Bezos has an actual, physical brand. And solves legitimate supply chain issues. Zuckerberg does not. Mark formed his business on a college hype experience and that hype is falling apart.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:58:53'] AWS solved major infrastructure problems for companies and is great to use. It cuts dev time dramatically and saves tons of money.The metaverse is kind of the opposite. It solves no problem and costs a fortune. It will probably morph into something interesting at some point and the tech is interesting, but as a concept, it is just so far from being ready for the market. The timing is also really bad. Half the population already has zoom fatigue so they aren't likely to slap on a vr headset in their free time. That same group is also the target audience because of the cost of entry of vr tech. It is kind of a perfect storm for shitty uptake of the product.Where this will get interesting is when AI / ML / NLP / VR come together to create a holodeck like experience where I can give a verbal description of a scene or experience and be dropped into it. As a software architect, I would actually be interested in working on that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:57:27'] Deep down I kind of feel like Metaverse is going to be a trillion dollar investment in 10 years just because inverse WSB to be honest
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:22:45'] Facebook is a screaming value stock right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:19:57'] Fair point but AWS is actually a business service. The metaverse is a pedo playground and DOA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 13:31:03'] I feel like the way people talk about the metaverse is how people talked about the internet when it first started to take off
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:14:08'] Metaverse is stupid. He wants to replace the standard internet environment with something that's just harder to use. Compare how you might list a product on a storefront on the metaverse vs a typical website. Right now you take a picture, name the product, name a price - and you're done. In the metaverse, what do you do to integrate it into VR? Make a 3d model? Put it in a 3d store that you also have to create? Have a salesman standing there in the metaverse telling you about the product? Or is it just a standard 2d listing but you need a headset and controllers to access it? It's all just harder. Not an improvement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:31:57'] Bezos created a brand new business that sold the technology and services that his store had been using, realizing lots of other companies would benefit from that technology and pay for it. AWS has grown into its own ecosphere, completely separate from Amazon itself. Meta is trying to sell another place to hang out with people you're not willing to actually hang out with in real life. We already reached max desire for that. It's Facebook 4.0, now with motion sickness. He doesn't have a new idea or product.  He's actually doing what the article wished Bezos had done.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:12:01'] The difference was that AWS was selling the infrastructure that was already in use at Amazon as a service.It was about maximizing ROCI - not dumping billions into something people actually hate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:29:26'] It could be major wallstreet players selling high via company‚Äôs stock-buyback to then later, buy back in when it‚Äôs low as now possibly being set by macroeconomic & geopolitical trends
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:54:09'] More like they're doing the same thing to Cohen. Zucks metaverse will be a failure. That boy can't create anything and nobody is selling him that shit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:28:09'] The original book where the term 'Metaverse' emerged, was a cyperpunk dystopia. No matter how bad things in real life are, you need to be extra desperade and socially awkward to live like this.Also VR and virtual worlds are nothing new. I don't see in what way this is considered 'innovation'.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:25:38'] So now every idea that everyone agrees sucks is actually great. This will significantly improve the odds of my ideas getting funding. Thank you?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:25:04'] If Zuckerberg didn‚Äôt track every detail and sell others info so cheap, people might trust him. I don‚Äôt dislike the concept of the metaverse. Not a chance in hell I‚Äôll play in any version zuck is involved in
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:54:34'] Just like anything risky - you're a genius if it works out and an idiot if it doesn't
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:28:41'] Maybe the Zuck could save some costs running his stuff on AWS and make 2 groups of shareholders happy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:58:20'] The two situations are totally different. We are talking about cloud service back in 2006. Who the fuck needs Meta? Tell me?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 14:06:16'] I also keep pictures of when I had hair.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:04:05'] >Jeff Bezos is a genius. He saw the potential of the internet and created Amazon, which is now one of the most successful companies in the world. Wall Street may have been skeptical of his vision at first, but he proved them wrong and made billions of dollars for himself and his shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:03:36'] I am still of the opinion that ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù was just a dodge for all the scrutiny Facebook was/is going through. The metaverse could very well be one of the next big things, but Zuckerberg might not be the face of that
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:11:14'] Maybe he's doing this because he's tired of the governments large social media presence and all the court appearances etc and figures if he just makes one giant video game with childish Nintendo Wii graphics that requires a headset that maybe it wouldn't be as appealing or easy to access for boomers as Facebook is now
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:12:55'] Except the metaverse is absolutely useless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:56:05'] not really, its not the same.Facebook, instagram and other meta services/apps are losing users daily.Theres other apps that offer better services now than these, life has cycles and so do companies and web services, before facebook there was hi5 and myspace and both died and ended.So theres no guarantee that meta will be here forever.Meta is going down and very fast it migth be on the end of its life cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:30:57'] I always hear invest in the things people are afraid of and the meta verse does sound corny af but maybe it‚Äôs just ahead of it‚Äôs time? Maybe Meta is at a great deal rn for long term run‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:25:10'] It‚Äôs gonna be cool when tech stocks are more independent. Or at least when the market realizes how awesome AMZN and GOOG are vs what a shit pile META is. Maybe AAPL is the point man‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:15:21'] Actually with porn, the metaverse can actually work big time, problem is, it will take many years of losses first, and there is no guarantee, they just have a big lead
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:32:33'] The metaverse just feels like putting an extra layer of shoes on to go for a walk. I don't have to do anything to the plane of reality I exist in. Why would I use a virtual one to do things I can already do without a funny hat or glasses? I think if you made a sleeping bag with all the sensory creators in it to mimick seeing a band live, getting hugged, or going to Mars for the aforementioned walk, you might have something. But even then, I think it's only going to work for people that can't experience those situations (disabled, fear of flying) or situations that can't be experienced (flying to Mars for a walk).Who knows... I'm sure gen x was asking my millennials can't meet up at the car instead of using a chatroom or watch TV instead of YouTube. I just know I'm out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:12:04'] Cuck the Zuck, I bought more AMZN off my gains on those META 110P sucks to suck Zuck
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:17:59'] Same could be said about Tesla FSD
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:23:45'] What's up with the hair?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:46:11'] the metaverse is a real shit, it ll never work.facebook worked well for some time because people love to show off and it leverages on these mean instincts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:09:46'] Hair growth should be a bigger business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:00:03'] They are not
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:56:57'] Bozo didn‚Äôt bet the farm on AWS.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:08:30'] Nope

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:07:54'] Ah yes, 2006 Bezos, transitioning well into De. Evil there
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:09:50'] Kick their AWS b boy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:15:41'] Nah. Facebook is going down the tube after being a big company for years. Amazon was up and coming and a not well known force back then. Very diffferent.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:16:23'] Bezos still had hair then, but not a lot of it
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:17:31'] I agree. The Meta verse is a risky investment but if it ever comes to fruition, in the case of being a great experience for the popular and enterprise , they will be so ahead of the competition that they will become the de facto monopoly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:21:54'] No one here actually understands the purpose of the Metaverse. It‚Äôs not meant to be a video game or a fantasy world.It‚Äôs meant to replace your phone, your television, your laptop, your computer, your tablet, etc. It‚Äôs meant to be the all in one substitute to replace any electronic device you could possibly need.And now you know the reason why Apple has been attacking Facebook ever since this project was announced. They know the insane potential this project has if it succeeds and how badly it could hurt Apple along with many other tech companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:25:53'] I think there is a lot of value in the "verse". If its the metaverse remains to be seen.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:34:38'] Wall of Shame Street
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:39:17'] The difference is Amazon‚Äôs core business was growing in a stable and predictable way, and the new business was based on sharing access to their infrastructure, not inventing a new market.     Facebook‚Äôs core business has been receding for years, particularly in the US. When they tried selling access to their infrastructure it was Cambridge Analytica.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 08:45:33'] Sure thing, Zuck‚Äôs PR team.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:11:41'] Damn, he looks older in the old picture!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:18:50'] But Meta is so Beta that they are different animal altogether (duck vs goose)
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:23:41'] Mark doesn't give a zuck what people think
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:24:37'] Jeff had the backing of Wall Street and big money. Zuck doesn‚Äôt even have the backing of the human suit he wears. It‚Äôs clearly trying to get away from him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:25:29'] I really like the jacked Bezos over that nerd on the cover
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:27:46'] I think he had a chin implant
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:36:09'] Mark is making a good bet. What people fail to understand is the metaverse isn‚Äôt up to our generation or even Gen Z, it‚Äôs up to the next generation and he‚Äôs betting big that they will push this tech forward just like millennials pushed Facebook forward. While it is abysmal to use now, I do have fun in VR it just isn‚Äôt at a level where the headset feels comfortable for long periods. If Mark can reduce the size of the headset to something like a pair of glasses, that can flip between AR / VR he could be on to something big
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 09:49:30'] Comparing apples to oranges isn‚Äôt funny. Bezos, to his credit, revolutionized the shopping paradigm. The Metaverse, by comparison, is vanity project for out of touch billionaires and celebrities.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 10:14:27'] Dude, Meta isn't worth shit now. I don't know how anyone can see value in a company that is dying. Unless Zuck throws in the towel and lets other people run his business, it will continue to fail. Metaverse is dumb as shit and hemorrhaging money.Amazon provided a needed service. Facebook does not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 10:19:36'] Short interest is 1% of float as of Friday.  I bet if we start pumping meta on wsb we can get those rookie numbers up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 10:20:14'] Not even remotely similar in terms of utility or problem solved‚Ä¶.The only parallel is the abstraction of physical resources‚Ä¶ aws  abstracts away compute infrastructure/data centres for computer nerdsThe metaverse abstracts away reality for losers whose real lives are too sad for them to go make real friends or afford to buy real things in the real world.The metaverse is a rebrand if second life, with worse graphics and motion sickness
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 10:34:02'] Nah, the meta verse is objectively dumb, and has no practical value to consumers. AWS always had obvious value to people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 11:28:14'] Isn't Amazon still unprofitable?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 11:52:57'] VR has been a dream that people have been trying to make happen for over 40 years now.Cloud and elastic computing is a reality that stemmed from beneficial impacts of automating operational loads and from advancements in abstraction architecture in operating systems.That's the difference. Questions about the cloud came from competition from existing and established models for provisioning architecture and enhancing development processes and anyone in the field who understood the need to scale architecture in shorter times understood the utility of cloud provisioning.VR, on the hand, is a biologically constrained wish. It's an idea that feels really good in your head, and is kinda neat IRL, but doesn't have a clear killer app that isn't already served in the existing ecosphere for gaming and where competing methods of playing for longer sessions have better overall comfort.Biologically, most people are somewhat limited in how long they can use VR. That's partially because of the state of the technology, but also because of very real and hard/impossible to get around sensory divergence problems. When you have a screen in front of you, your brain knows how to discern motion and normalize your other senses with it because it has relative reference for stability in the periphery. It knows the motion is on the screen.In VR, the better you get immersion the worse this effect becomes.They've definitely made it a lot better, but this is part of the reason for such high expenditures, to try to find a way to crack the biological limitation problem. The problem with that is... no one knows if you can do it or not.And then you have the industrial problem: You definitely have solid industrial applications out there, but for applications where there's clear ROI, they're niche.Cloud computing and better scaling can clearly enhance company ROI and can be accounted for on a balance sheet... while that was questioned at the beginning, anyone actually working the numbers on the need for more architectures and faster scaling methodologies could have easily seen it even in 2006.The same right now can't be said for the Metaverse, so I would not equate these things. Not every forward-looking high tech idea catches on or is necessarily clearly good.Another big difference is that the market for cloud computing already existed in the existing hosting space. For VR, the few vendors in that market have to create an entirely new and competing ecosystem of software... which is not a blocker by itself (as it's true for all new software ecosystems and devs will step forward and provide that environment) but it also means the bootstrapping and lead-in costs are greater for the Metaverse than for cloud computing from a certain perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 12:00:36'] you're such a disappointment  Jeffery.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 12:03:17'] There was a huge market for cloud based web applications in 2006 and there‚Äôs exponentially more demand today.There‚Äôs not a whole lot of demand for a shitty second life clone that doesn‚Äôt actually have a way of making money or offering a service in the way that cloud based computing does.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 12:17:13'] Now ask anyone dealing with AWS and theyll tell you what a POS it is
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 12:18:19'] They are doing exactly the same with Meta and VR. Meta literally has a monopoly in the VR ecosystem, this is the exact reason for Apples privacy play too. Apple is nervous af if VR goes mainstream and no one uses screen form factor.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 13:37:18'] They absolutely are. Jeff bezos was 42 years old the year this was published. Mark is currently 38. He is a generational visionary and talent. In 2043 ‚ÄúIf you would have invested $10,000 into $META during the recession of 2022 you would now have 1.2 million.‚Äù Cmon folks, we have seen this story before.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 14:18:06'] Good argument for GME right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 14:18:53'] I like how everyone says that META is a dead stock when they are growing in every single aspect, they are going down on cash flow because they are investing everything literally. If they stop investing and resume their normal life, it's the same crazy money machine company that is still growing on users despite having nearly 3billion user/month.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 14:23:01'] There are tons of developers who make really amazing stuff for VR and they are directly competing with cringe meta shit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 20:03:41'] The difference is web hosting at scale is a need and was really expensive. You needed to plan months in advance and pay for usage you didn‚Äôt always need.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:22:51'] maybe. But it's totally different stuff though. Meta-verse is just bull shit and AWS is a money-making biz.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:15:32'] Maybe, the problem is it's almost impossible to know. Everyone is able to breakdown how obvious amazon was in hindsight but not many of them were talking about it at the time. The only thing we can know is what they report which is that its a black hole for cash atm add that to generally negative sentiment in the market plus the additional negative sentiment about zuck and you get the price action you're seeing atm. If you're perhaps able to forecast the future of vr and how their metaverse will perform there could be opportunity here or maybe it will just be a dumpster fire forever. But not like its even that cheap, it's just cheaper than it was after some crazy pandemic market conditions
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:46:05'] Hey Jeff,  I'll bet there's enough profit there to provide health benefits to all of the people working for Amazon companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:04:38'] The "metaverse" doesn't have to exceed for Meta to make a shit load of money in the XR space. Whenever I read these comments "metaverse this and metaverse that" I know that the commenter doesn't know what they're talking about. No one who is playing VR regularly is thinking about or talking about the "metaverse" but they're still on the platform everyday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:18:44'] ‚ÄúDick in a box yeah‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:37:25'] Lmao there are actually people who believe in the metaverse created by the Lizzard that no one likes? I‚Äòll be sitting here with popcorn when the Zuck realizes that he alone is THE problem in his brand/company and just putting his face on it is enough to scare people off. He could gift me an oculus and i wouldn‚Äòt use it/create a mandatory Meta account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:12:54'] VR though is still fairly niche at this point. It‚Äôs gotten quite a bit better and is probably more popular than ever, but it‚Äôs not really a ubiquitous consumer tech yet. Also, current social VR is not really all that fun, there‚Äôs nobody there, it looks like shit, and there‚Äôs nothing to do. People want to play games on it, not hang out and talk to shitty avatars from the mid-2000s. If they want it to get big, they need to create another reason for people to be there, some sort of primary draw and not just have a glorified chat room. A smash hit game or even creating some sort of VR dating app seem like they could have potential, but I doubt it‚Äôs going to be something that Meta creates, they don‚Äôt seem particularly innovative.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 07:30:00'] Lol. No one in their right mind thought AWS was a ‚Äúrisky bet‚Äù. AWS was basically somebody renting out their extra room for money. Then the side hustle ended up making a lot of money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:31:11'] 1. Buffett is a focus investor. When he buys stocks, it's as if he's buying the company. He is running a corporation not a tax-sheltered retirement account. So he faces big tax bills for selling gains. Moreover, Buffett's philosophy is to let stocks run for multiple baggers as with Apple. So, when he buys, he buys permanently - unless he changes his mind. But it's very unusual for him to change his mind.2. Buffett is an arb. He's been arbing takeovers since the 1950s. That's Activision. He's not an insider at MSFT, but he is an arb. He knows MSFT has plenty of cash to get the deal done.3. To gain insight about what he's thinking, it's best to consider his new positions and adds. This year he's been buying some major oil companies and Paramount Global, HP, and Citibank. When Buffett buys he moves billions of dollars. His co-managers move much smaller amounts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:34:47'] He is concentrated but he also buys things when they‚Äôre a good buy. He didn‚Äôt choose that to be the allocation, he buys what he views is a good buy.

Why?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 01:54:43'] While it may not be Kosher on this meme investing sub, on average you will make more money by investing into everything (an index fund) than by any other stock investment scheme. The two exceptions are when you play an active role in a company (like Berkshire Hathaway does in all of those companies it owns larger portions of), and when you can read financial statements and understand cashflows well enough to recognize low risk unicorns when they occasionally appear. That‚Äôs when you short and make big money. But I‚Äôll tell you right now, pretty much any company you‚Äôve ever heard of isn‚Äôt going to be a unicorn; those things take work to find.

However, it's worth noting that even during the dot-com bubble, some growth stocks continued to thrive. So it's possible that some of today's high-flying tech stocks could continue to outperform even if the overall market corrects.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 07:16:33'] I would say that market manipulation is always a possibility, but that doesn't mean that Prem Watsa's warning is necessarily inaccurate. He may have his own reasons for wanting to drive down the price of certain tech stocks, but the fact remains that many growth-oriented stocks have reached sky-high valuations in recent years. Whether or not a "painful selloff" will actually occur is anyone's guess, but it's clear that the market is currently experiencing a great deal of volatility and uncertainty.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 08:18:04'] >I think he is right. The valuations of growth stocks, particularly technology stocks, are extremely high relative to value stocks.

Amazon isn't growing at a pace that justifies their p/e, and only part of the company making money is AWS, which is far from the dominant player it once was, in fact Microsoft azure is growing so fast, it's out competing AWS.\n\n amazon e-commerce has more competition now from Shopify, Walmart, and other smaller players, this doesn't mean it's declining, it just means that it's not gonna grow like the startup it used to be, it will be slow steady growth, that can't possibly justify its current valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:18:00'] Yes, I think it will.  None of this really is rocket science.  With inflation that means prices rise.  As prices rise people spend more for the necessities which leaves less disposable income.  Less disposable income means you by less junk you really don't need.Amazon is the king of places to buy junk you really do not need.  In a nutshell, I think people will curb spending.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:33:48'] Amazon could make their own for less than purchasing pton. Include the videos with prime membership. Even selling bikes at cost would give them a higher subscription %Only reason they would buy would be if they can get it at a steal. Like a mega steal. We all know PTON is about to sht it‚Äôs bed. I bought a treadmill during all this but it wasn‚Äôt a PTON. Looked into them but ship time was like 6 weeks and price was stupid. When things finally get back to normal I‚Äôll be hitting the gym.

If peloton ditched its hardware and went full service maybe it will have value in its current customer base. IMO it doesn‚Äôt have any core competencies that make it unique other than its idea. But it‚Äôs an idea that can be easily copied and probably executed better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 15:55:19'] If you saw the Hertz pump and dump.. welcome to the sleepy SCC days
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 16:20:24'] Apple and Nike could go in together, which could lead to a messy deal.Or Apple could buy both Nike and Peloton to have a great sports market, I think it's unlikely but would be great for my Nike and apple holdings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 16:43:00'] Knowing about Amazons practices when it comes to stealing products, I don't think they would buy it. Sure they would have the brand which might be good, but at the same time they can just slap amazon alexa on a bike and call it a day

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:13:14'] Nope. These are just rumors from hedge funds that are long on PTON. they need the price to go up so that they can close their positions and not lose their shirts. Short HF do the same thing when they want the price to go down. They spread rumors so retail can hold the bag.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:31:25'] nope.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:34:18'] Yes, but the question is, for what price? It‚Äôs really just customer acquisition, so whatever their customer base is worth to another company is the value. What else do they really have that can‚Äôt be easily replicated?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:38:50'] What does Peloton have that Amazon, Apple, and Nike can't copy or don't already offer? I guess the name is infamous.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 17:52:23'] They are good business bro. They didn‚Äôt become rich by buying overpriced stuff.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 18:37:05'] I see PTON as a flash-in-the-pan company that arose during pandemic lockdowns, catering to some peoples' vanity. The idea of "I won't let my body go to hell during this lockdown" or "now's my chance to get that ripped bod I've been saying I'll get" sold a lot of units. Post-lockdown (and a few incidents), bring out the moth balls...the glory is fading quick.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 00:09:20'] Any company can go to an OEM and order the treadmills themselves. The only thing worth acquiring is the peloton brand and (shrinking) user base, which i dont think is worth much. Definitely not worth the current market cap. But its not uncommon for big companies to make mistake purchases, only to shutter it quietly years later.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 04:18:54'] Peloton went from income of $59 million for Q4 2020, to a loss of $373.6 million for Q3 2021...

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:38:11'] Do I believe it will happen? Idk.Do I believe it could happen? Absolutely.Peloton is far and away the biggest household name in terms of fitness equipment now (think Bowflex in the 90s/early 2000s).Subscription revenue is the king of tech these days. If a bigger company came in and made the equipment itself more affordable and was able to increase monthly users, why not?Whether the ultimate acquisition price would be above/below where PTON is currently trading, who knows.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:49:19'] makes sense for AMZN .. would increase the value of prime membership
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 12:12:39'] Sure, Apple is the ideal fit, but anyone would want 3M subscribers. In addition you get a product that is inside a home, one more means of data source.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 13:36:33'] This feels like the perfect Apple acquisition to me. They already have a health/fitness arm with their Apple Watch and a company with a very loyal fanbase is right up Apple's alley.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:35:26']  My guess is a big NO
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:48:40'] It will 100% not happen. If yes they would definitely not have appointed a new CEO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:49:03'] It's definitely speculation. It might happen.It's really a good acquisition idea, if you lay off all the management and HR, you have a profitable business. If you can tie it into other existing services, it's even better.It would make sense for a company that already makes wearable electronics or health monitoring products to want to buy them. There's a short list of companies that can buy a $9B company, which is why people speculate Apple or Nike would. I could see either company making the Peloton assets become profitable, but I don't know that either one wants to.I really can't think of why AMZN would want them... maybe Amazon Prime content?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 11:50:14'] Apple won‚Äôt buy for sure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 15:34:29'] I think Amazon is sitting on so much cash, they literally don‚Äôt know what to spend it on. Almost bored. That‚Äôs when management starts making bad decisions. Caution to the wind on Amazon until a stock split comes our way.

POST_TEXT: b"If you don't own AMD puts going into the earning release tonight you have only yourself to blame for this missed opportunity.  Here is the logic behind a horrific earnings report:  \nNew AMD chips are slower than Intel's 13th gen Raptor Lake equivalent.  New IHS design creates excessive heat. Heat pipe issues with latest  GPU's resulting in replacements for customers on AMD's dime will negatively impact 1st quarter 2023 results.  When comparing sales of the latest CPU's, AMD is getting hammered by Intel.   \n\n\nThe only bright spots for AMD are sales of Tesla's are through the roof and they use AMD chips in their display, though the profit margin is minimal with these, and the new motherboards for the AM5 platform will push up motherboard chipsets sales.  \n\n\nComparison of top sellers on Amazon for CPU's (compare 7xxx to 13xxx chips)  \n[https://us.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189](https://us.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189)  \n\n\nG"

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:28:17'] Are you sure rocket lab didn't sign this secret deal with bed bath & beyond?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:15:26'] Bezos is chomping at the bit to get his constellation off the ground. The only thing that could fuck this up would be WW3.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 20:08:12'] Why does the options market not reflect this?  If you say its because only you know this than despite your incredibly well presented and written post, I would be inclined to think that the probability of me talking to you who is the .... get my point.  And no offense meant.Thank you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 00:50:44'] Does it matter who the customer is from a numbers perspective?  They‚Äôve already disclosed the existence of the mega customer and the fact of sales of thousands of wheels will be occurring, so shouldn‚Äôt that already be reflected in the price?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 07:07:46'] it seems like Amazon is the company behind the undisclosed deal with Rocketlab. The Amazon project Kuipar, a huge satellite fleet, is potentially worth billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years. Adam Spice, Rocketlab CFO, attended an event and did a presentation, answering questions regarding the new reaction wheels. He gave away too much information and the information seems to point to Amazon's project Kuipar.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 22:24:05'] Dude. If you were an expert in this field you‚Äôd know a few things:1.	It‚Äôs fucking spelled ‚ÄúKuiper‚Äù not ‚ÄúKuipar‚Äù2.	Kuiper is a long ways away from even launching those 600kg satellites. They‚Äôre launching two small test satellites at the end of the year. Launching the bigger satellites is sometime in 2024 - at best. 3.	most importantly - Kuiper is building their reaction wheels in house. Kuiper is notorious for wanting to control their components. On the last item, here‚Äôs a quote from the Head of Kuiper- >	‚ÄúAffordability is Job One for us,‚Äù said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really important for us to keep that cost low, because if we don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very difficult to get the unserved and underserved connected to our service. So we took on the challenge to design our satellites two orders of magnitude cheaper.‚Äù>	There are no glimpses, however, at the satellites themselves. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre designing the solar arrays, we‚Äôre designing the reaction wheels,‚Äù Badyal said.A $100k reaction wheel is fucking expensive and can definitely be made cheaper.Edit: this is either an obvious P&D or OP has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. My comment got downvoted seconds after I posted it. Someone didn‚Äôt like the factual information.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-25 04:58:04'] Hey , the link you sent for reaction wheel production was in 2021. That was an older facility. So they likely are looking at more than 2000.Also, where did you get the 100,000-120,000 price range for per wheel cost?
